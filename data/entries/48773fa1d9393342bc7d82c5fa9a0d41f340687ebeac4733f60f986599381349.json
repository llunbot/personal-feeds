The beta period lasts until July 2, and after that, Unicode 16 will see a release and the new characters will be officially approved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt often takes smartphone makers like Apple several months to create artwork for new emoji characters that are approved, so it is likely we won't see these new emoji until after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> launches. Apple will likely add the new characters sometime around March 2025, around when iOS 18.4 comes out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last introduced new emoji <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/\">with the iOS 17.4 update</a> that was released in March 2024. Characters added in iOS 17.4 include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a \"yes\" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a \"no\" head shake).<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emoji/\">Emoji</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/ios-18-emoji-characters/\">Next Emoji Coming to iOS Could Include Face With Eye Bags, Shovel, Fingerprint, Splatter and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-emoji-coming-to-ios-could-include-face-with-eye-bags-shovel-fingerprint-splatter-and-more.2427059/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"48773fa1d9393342bc7d82c5fa9a0d41f340687ebeac4733f60f986599381349","category":"Apple"}
