So they basically redesigned everything about it. Now, it’s better than ever, with more options and a lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New seals, easier travel adjust, user-friendly servicing, more adjustability, and a much, much smoother initiation round out the updates, making this a much better dropper and putting them back on top of the game. Here are the details…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-ShraderValve-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1332\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-ShraderValve-1.jpg\" alt=\"air valve diagram for 2025 fox transfer dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-ShraderValve-1.jpg 1332w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-ShraderValve-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-ShraderValve-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-ShraderValve-1-768x577.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prior design had a preset air pressure that wasn’t user adjustable. New dynamic air shaft seals work better and eliminate gradual air loss and they added a Schrader valve to the top. This lets you adjust the air pressure to tune compression force and rebound speed, and also top it off rather than send it in for servicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do have to remove the saddle to adjust air pressure, but a sealed valve cap further reduces air loss, so you won’t have to do it often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also moved the IFP to the top of the post, so the piston no longer slides through the IFP, which reduces the number of seals and opportunities for leakage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-dropper-details.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-dropper-details-1536x769.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2025 fox transfer dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-dropper-details-1536x769.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-dropper-details-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-dropper-details-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-dropper-details-768x385.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-dropper-details.jpg 1997w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The collar adds dual oil seals with a wiper seal, which increases service life 6x. All told, Fox says the new Transfer has an impressive 300-hour service life. We rode through a few wet spots at the launch, and the seals were visibly keeping everything out:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-5-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2025 fox transfer dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-5-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-5-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-5.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, the collar is easily removable to wipe everything clean. Just twist it open and slide it up (no tools needed), wipe it down, re-tighten it, and go ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also allows quick travel adjustments in 5mm increments, with a more robust design that maintains exact spacing standards for accurate travel and seat height. It’s all user-serviceable with no special tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-4-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2025 fox transfer dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-4.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their two-bolt saddle clamp has a low stack height and sleek new design that’s a bit lighter. Thankfully they kept the front bolt that angles forward so your hex wrench clears the stanchion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-1-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2025 fox transfer dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-fox-transfer-dropper-post-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox knows there’s a lot of talk about stack height, and that everyone wants the lowest possible so they can get more travel on their bike. The new Transfer isn’t the shortest, but Fox defends that by having a bit more bushing overlap than others, which means their total post length is just a bit longer, and it’s a few grams heavier. But it’ll be far more robust and easier to drop without the weird scooching and angling we all do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That last bit is enhanced by all-new, metal-backed Ekonol bushings that replace the prior IGUS bushings. They have less friction and tighter tolerances, so there’s less slop. The upper bushing is now in the post, not the collar, so it has higher tolerances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Fox claims a 62% reduction in friction and says they are 46% easier to actuate and initiate the drop. Having ridden it, I’ll confirm, it’s a LOT easier to get the post moving. I barely had to shift my weight, if at all, which saved a lot of energy on hours-long rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Fox Transfer Specs, Options &amp; Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-factory-performance-dropper-posts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1079\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-factory-performance-dropper-posts-1536x1079.jpg\" alt=\"2025 fox transfer factory and performance dropper posts lined up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-factory-performance-dropper-posts-1536x1079.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-factory-performance-dropper-posts-297x209.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-factory-performance-dropper-posts-120x84.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-factory-performance-dropper-posts-768x539.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-transfer-factory-performance-dropper-posts-2048x1438.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Models – Factory (Kashima) and Performance Elite</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diameter Sizes (mm) – 30.9 / 31.6 / 34.9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drop Travel – 95-120mm / 125-150mm / 155-180mm / 185-210mm / 215-240mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MSRP –\n<ul>\n<li>Factory Series: $339 / $449 CAD /  €449</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Performance Series Elite: $289 / $389 CAD / €369</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each post has 25mm total travel adjustment range, easily done with spacers.
