Housed within a Victorian warehouse, it’s a shop that’s synonymous with Scottish cycling success, having been the early sponsor of the Endura Racing team, so it’s fitting that it’s fronted by one of Scotland’s most successful riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pedal Power traces its history back to the 1970s, but it wasn’t until 2000, when its elderly owner decided to sell up, that ex-Scottish and British champion Jonathan McBain took over at the age of just 22. McBain is a man who doesn’t like to stand still, as proven by his dealership’s development in the years since. He tells us more…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Everyone’s welcome </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Before Covid, we used to have a Tuesday night chaingang – a proper 26-mile ride that we had around 120 people turn up for every time. It was unbelievable, and we’re trying to rebuild this riding element.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’re also creating a great community in the shop. As well as the showroom, we have an area in the upper level that we’re turning into somewhere you can come in, grab a coffee, get on the internet, watch TV, that kind of thing. We’re hoping to have it ready for a big launch event around Strade Bianche in March. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello West Calder\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve had quite a few events in the past, and we’re hoping to raise more money for charities like “Ride For Charlie” and “RideLikeRab”.’’We’ve had quite a few events in the past, and we’re hoping to raise more money for charities like “Ride For Charlie” and “RideLikeRab”.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Training terrain</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When it comes to riding, there’s such a variety up here. The side roads out of West Calder heading towards Glasgow are dead quiet; you don’t see anyone, it’s all farms, beautiful. Then you can climb to one of the high points of West Lothian and see for miles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Heading north, you have what we call the ‘Bathgate Alps’ – everything’s just a wee leg-bender! You can cover 3,000m of ascent in an afternoon. The Pentland Hills are great for gravel, and an hour from here you’re in the gravel mecca of Aberfoyle, or can head down to Glentress for mountain biking.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The West Highland Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Early last year, I had this mad idea to ride the West Highland Way. People said to wait for the summer but I just thought, “I’ll do it on Thursday.” I jumped in my camper van, drove up to Fort William, dropped the van there and got the train back to Glasgow. I woke up at Milngavie at 5am and headed north. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-3-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello West Calder\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-3-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-3-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-3-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/pinarello-west-calder-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘That was a big day out: 100 miles of off-road in 12 hours on my Pinarello Dogma XC. I’ve not done many crazy missions like that before and it really makes you question what you’re up to. Now that I’ve got a better bike, I’m hoping to qualify for the Gravel Worlds in Nice.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Team tactics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There are ten of us here at Pedal Power, and all are valued as part of the team. For starters, we have a room dedicated to bike-fitting, a sales team, a brilliant workshop, and we even have coaching available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re slap bang in the most densely populated area of Scotland, so there are probably a million people within half an hour’s drive of us. What better reason to visit than to get a bike-fit, some coaching advice and a decent coffee? It’s a huge shop, so there’s plenty of room for everyone.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dream fulfilment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Pinarello has always been an aspirational brand. When someone’s coming in looking to spend £12,000 on a Dogma, the experience should tick all the boxes. That’s where our bike-fitting service, our coaching and our workshop all help to make everything perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We sell a good number of X-series Pinarellos too; that range has really put the brand within the grasp of people with smaller budgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has finally made the dream of owning these Italian bikes, and tapping into all the glory and heritage associated with them, achievable.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.pedalpower.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to find out more about Pedal Power in West Calder</strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-pedal-power-west-calder\">Pinarello focus: Pedal Power, West Calder</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"44476dd08c9f927d49fb62935e9993db00e1a3f4920c3644cc0ffe415b08d0d1","category":"Cycling"}
