{"title":"iOS 15: How to Create a Focus","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-create-focus/","date":1626720457000,"content":"In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, Apple introduced a new Focus feature that aims to help reduce distractions and let you zone in on a single thing. Focus does this by filtering notifications based on what you're doing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iOS-15-Focus-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith Focus, you can set your device to help you be in the moment by creating a custom Focus or selecting a suggested one based on the context, like during work hours or while you're winding down for bed. It's also possible to create ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a>‌ pages with apps and ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>‌ that apply to moments of focus to only display relevant apps and reduce temptation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>How to Create a Custom Focus</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Control Center</strong> and tap the <strong>Focus</strong> button.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap the <strong>New Focus</strong> button at the bottom, indicated by a plus sign.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/create-custom-focus-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>Select <strong>Custom</strong> to create a new Focus.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Give your custom Focus a name and choose a colour/emoji/icon to make it recognizable, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/create-custom-focus-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>On the next screen, tap <strong>Add Person</strong> to choose the people you want to receive notifications from when the Focus mode is enabled.

There, you'll find additional settings available to you, including the option to <strong>Hide Notification Badges</strong> on app icons and an option to hide certain ‌Home Screen‌ pages using the <strong>Custom Page</strong> toggle. You can also choose to <strong>Dim Lock Screen</strong> appearance and <strong>Show On Lock Screen</strong> any silenced notifications you receive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/create-custom-focus-4a.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, note the <strong>Smart Activation</strong> option, which when turned on allows your device to turn on the custom Focus automatically at relevant times throughout the day, based on signals like your location, app usage, and more. Alternately, choose <strong>Add Schedule or Automation</strong> to have the Focus turn on automatically at a set time, location, or while using a certain app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>How to Turn On a Focus</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nTurning a Focus on is easy. Simply launch the <strong>Control Center</strong>, tap the <strong>Focus</strong> button, then select the Focus you want to enable. You can also tap the <strong>ellipsis</strong> (three dots) button to enable it <strong>For 1 hour</strong>, <strong>Until this evening</strong>, or <strong>Until I leave this location</strong>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/create-custom-focus-5.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTo disable the Focus, just tap the <strong>Focus</strong> button again in Control Center and then tap the active Focus.
