At one point in 2024, Buffett was even Apple's largest investor outside of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2024, Berkshire's stake in Apple was valued at $174 billion, which the company had acquired for $40 billion over several years. That said, the conglomerate has been shedding its holdings in the company throughout the past year, and it has now sold nearly 70% of the 905 million shares it held at its peak.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince Cook took over as CEO in 2011, Apple's stock has seen remarkable growth, climbing from under $15 on a split-adjusted basis to $205. The roughly 14-fold increase has propelled Apple's market capitalisation to over $3 trillion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBuffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha and arguably the world's most successful investor, told his company's annual meeting he would hand over the reins to vice-chairman Greg Abel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>There’s never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom.
