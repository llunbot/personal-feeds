(credit: <a href=\"https://x.com/orikron/status/1824076424111661164\">BiliBili</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>It's no secret that despite significant investment from companies like OpenAI and Runway, AI-generated videos still <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/we-made-a-cat-drink-a-beer-with-runways-ai-video-generator-and-it-sprouted-hands/\">struggle to achieve</a> convincing realism at times. Some of the <a href=\"https://x.com/CharaspowerAI/status/1819443246478610618\">most amusing fails</a> end up on social media, which has led to a new response trend on Chinese social media platforms TikTok and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili\">Bilibili</a> where users create videos that mock the imperfections of AI-generated content. The trend has since spread to X (formerly Twitter) in the US, where users have been sharing the humorous parodies.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, the videos seem to parody image synthesis videos where subjects <a href=\"https://x.com/CharaspowerAI/status/1819443246478610618\">seamlessly morph</a> into other people or objects in unexpected and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SipsTea/comments/1ashf65/ai_videos_are_weird/\">physically impossible</a> ways. Chinese social media replicate these unusual visual non-sequiturs without special effects by positioning their bodies in unusual ways as new and unexpected objects appear on-camera from out of frame.</p>\n<p>This exaggerated mimicry has struck a chord with viewers on X, who find the parodies entertaining. User @theGioM <a href=\"https://x.com/theGioM/status/1824000938870292771\">shared one video</a>, seen above. \"<span>This is high-level performance arts,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/ArtsRayne/status/1824103991233712424\">wrote</a> one X user. \"art is imitating life imitating ai, almost shedded a tear.\" Another <a href=\"https://x.com/vanamerongen/status/1824071986517041609\">commented</a>, </span>\"I feel like it still needs a motorcycle the turns into a speedboat and takes off into the sky. Other than that, excellent work.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043808#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043808&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed96f1777b0ce5830a35102730c3299c243e8b3b6bfb37595c3b61be2b1d6a05","category":"Tech"}
