It wasn’t just Tesla CEO Elon Musk—who has been </span><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2015/12/21/elon-musk-interview/\"><span>making outlandish predictions</span></a><span> about self-driving technology since 2015. In 2016, Ford </span><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3108493/ford-to-offer-self-driving-cars-without-steering-wheels-by-2021.html\"><span>set a goal</span></a><span> to start selling cars without steering wheels by 2021. The same year, Lyft </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@johnzimmer/the-third-transportation-revolution-27860f05fa91#.f1csicx9o\"><span>predicted</span></a><span> that a majority of rides on its network would be autonomous by 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span>None of that happened. Instead, the last few years have seen brutal consolidation. Uber </span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/uber-sells-self-driving-project-to-startup-aurora/\"><span>sold off its self-driving project</span></a><span> in 2020, and Lyft </span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/lyft-is-getting-out-of-the-self-driving-business/\"><span>shut down its effort</span></a><span> in 2021. Then, last October, Ford and Volkswagen announced they were </span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/argo-ai-will-cease-operations-as-ford-and-volkswagen-pull-investments/\"><span>shutting down their self-driving joint venture</span></a><span> called Argo AI.</span></p>\n<p><span>Today, a lot of people view self-driving technology as an expensive failure whose moment has passed. The Wall Street Journal’s Chris Mims argued in 2021 that </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-cars-could-be-decades-away-no-matter-what-elon-musk-said-11622865615\"><span>self-driving cars “could be decades away</span></a><span>.”</span><span> Last year, Bloomberg’s Max Chafkin </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-06/even-after-100-billion-self-driving-cars-are-going-nowhere\"><span>declared</span></a><span> that “self-driving cars are going nowhere.”</span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943180#p3\">Read 58 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943180&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
