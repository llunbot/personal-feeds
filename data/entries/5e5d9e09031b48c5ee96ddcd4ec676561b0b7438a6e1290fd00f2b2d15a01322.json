{"title":"‘Apple in China’ — New Book by Patrick McGee, Coming in May","link":"https://appleinchina.com/","date":1738623440000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/commander-in-cheat\">Speaking of books</a>, Simon &amp; Shuster announced a new one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple isn’t just a brand; it’s the world’s most valuable company\nand creator of the twenty-first century’s defining product. The\niPhone has revolutionized the way we live, work and connect. But\nApple is now a victim of its own success, caught in the middle of\na new Cold War between two superpowers.</p>\n\n<p>On the brink of bankruptcy in 1996, Apple launched a new strategy\nto outsource its manufacturing. After experimenting in eight\ncountries, nearly all of its operations were lured to China by the\npromises of affordable, ubiquitous labour. As the iPod and iPhone\ntransformed Apple’s fortunes, their sophisticated production\nplayed a seminal role financing, training, supervising, and\nsupplying Chinese manufacturers — skills Beijing is now\nweaponizing against the West.</p>\n\n<p><em>Apple in China</em> is the sometimes disturbing and always revelatory\nstory of how an outspoken, proud company that once praised\n“rebels” and “troublemakers” — the company that encouraged us all\nto “Think Different” — devolved into a silent, passive partner to\na belligerent regime that increasingly controls its fate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve long been a fan of McGee’s work as the Financial Times’s Silicon Valley correspondent. Two years ago, the Financial Times ran a good two-part series by McGee that seemingly started him down the path to this book: “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5a80891-b27d-4110-90c9-561b7836f11b?accessToken=zwAAAZTN6lqvkdPVqAiRsn1BENOQyVYbeDbxGw.MEQCIBLmEdWXrV1FdyaYLM95iSpk2NbUN4rXb9DW3wSvZwzXAiBZ3xoDR8WENu91A2AKCy1xlinW7S6wSnK_6vU54_3U0A&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=fca686db-d401-45aa-9413-19bed1c546a8\">How Apple Tied Its Fortunes to China</a>”, and “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74f7e284-c047-4cc4-9b7a-408d40611bfa?accessToken=zwAAAZTN6rGikc909-KEwEdMxNObekCNQGEb-g.MEQCIFEiKzIfwaWOAw4oWCS2qJRTOxYvWRq_aOiLL9W52cReAiBGMxJbNZy8AO52S8J_NOHjfVsgX5tal9cYFkwRRnKGQg&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=2081eba1-72f0-4c8c-8cae-91bc46718e97\">What It Would Take for Apple to Disentangle Itself From China</a>”.
