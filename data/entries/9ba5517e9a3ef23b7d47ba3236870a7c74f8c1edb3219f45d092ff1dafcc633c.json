With these, there is no need to take off the tyre – just plug, re-inflate and go.</p>\n<p>While there are a number of tubeless repair kits out there, most work in a similar way, using a rubber plug to fill the hole.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve found the puncture, remove any offending items (a pick or a small pair of pliers are a useful addition to your tool bag for this very purpose).</p>\n<p>Next, use your tubeless plug tool to make sure there’s a sufficiently large hole for the plug to enter – carefully insert the spike into the tyre to avoid damaging the rim tape, and twist to give a clean, round hole.</p>\n<p>Thread a tubeless plug through the head of the tubeless plug tool. Most tools will come with a choice of different plug sizes to suit the size of the hole.</p>\n<p>With the plug in the centre of the tool, insert it into the tyre, making sure you don’t push through fully.</p>\n<p>Then twist carefully to slowly remove the tool, leaving the two ends of the plug on the outside of the tyre.</p>\n<p>Inflate the tyre to your desired pressure, taking additional caution with high-pressure <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road tyres</a>, and rotate the wheel so that the plug is at the ground for a few minutes before you get going again. This will allow some sealant to flow into the repair and fully seal things.</p>\n<p>You may need to trim the tails of the plug that are left behind, but take care not to cut it too close to the tyre.</p>\n<h2>How to patch a punctured tubeless tyre</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/How-to-repair-a-punctured-tubeless-tyre-03-ac3accb.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>A small section of sandpaper or metal can be used to roughen the area where you want to place the patch for better attachment.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/How-to-repair-a-punctured-tubeless-tyre-05-45e7dff.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Add the vulcanising rubber solution to the affected area and wait until tacky before applying the patch.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/How-to-repair-a-punctured-tubeless-tyre-06-3fabc35.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The added tubeless tyre patch should stop any air leaking out from the inside of the tyre.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>For more stubborn tubeless tyre punctures that can’t be fixed with a plug, it may be necessary to patch the tyre internally. The process for this is very similar to patching an inner tube.</p>\n<p>First, you’ll need to roughen the surface that you want your patch to adhere to, using a little sandpaper, making sure there’s no debris left from the puncture. Cleanliness is key when it comes to gluing patches.</p>\n<p>Add some vulcanising rubber solution to the area where you want to add the patch, waiting for it to become tacky as per the kit instructions.</p>\n<p>Add the tubeless tyre patch and press down firmly. Try to avoid touching the surface that is to be glued because this can contaminate the adhesive.</p>\n<p>Depending on the patch type, these may need minutes or hours to dry, before setting the tyre up tubeless as normal.</p>\n<p>If successful, a patched tubeless tyre can last for many rides, often to the end of the tyre’s life.</p>\n<h2>How to repair serious tyre tears</h2>\n<p>A torn tyre can be a rider’s worst nightmare.

Inserting an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\" target=\"_blank\">inner tube</a> can be a mucky business with sealant already in the tyre, so it’s generally a last resort.</p>\n<p>Before fitting an inner tube, thoroughly check the tyre for any punctures or offending items such as thorns. Just because you’ve found one, doesn’t mean there won’t be more embedded in the rubber waiting to puncture your inner tube too!</p>\n<p>You can still get <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fix-a-puncture-video/\">snakebite punctures</a> with tubeless too, so make sure you’re running adequate pressures in your tyres, especially over harsh or rocky terrain to avoid a nasty double puncture from an impact on the rim. These are notoriously tricky to fix, with holes often too close to the tyre bead.</p>\n<p>Besides punctured tyres, there are other things that need careful maintenance to keep your tubeless set up running smoothly, including the rim tape, tubeless valves and sealant.</p>\n<p>It can be pretty hard to sort these on the go, so that’s when you might need to pop in a tube and leave the closer inspection until you’re home.</p>","author":"Katherine Moore","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9ba5517e9a3ef23b7d47ba3236870a7c74f8c1edb3219f45d092ff1dafcc633c","category":"Cycling"}
