It’s a serious undertaking, more than 2,000km in 16 days, but don’t you worry – she has reliably informed me that she has at least packed her electric toothbrush. No cutting off your manual brush’s handle to save weight here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The World of Cycledom has also been enjoying <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/netflix-unchained-review\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix’s new reality TV show, <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em></a>, while simultaneously, of course, looking ahead to the very thing itself. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France stage-by-stage guide</a> to see how <em>La Grande Boucle </em>2023 might just pan out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for me, well I’ve been less intrepid, but I have been busy making <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cyclist</em> magazine’s 141st issue</a>, starring our hardest ever Big Ride, The Circle of Death (no really, it’s what the Tour history books call it) plus an exclusive profile with Pippa York (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pippa-york-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">who we also had on the Cyclist Magazine Podcast</a>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the weather, sweet glory! I’ve enjoyed dusting off my summer wheels and getting out into the countryside to marvel at just how quickly hedgerows grow while trying to model the relationship between the size of a car and the driver’s ability to assess space in it. Put it this way, Ford Fiestas will gracefully tuck in to effect a safe pass, but Range Rovers seem incapable of going within five feet of a bramble. Go figure, a Range Rover is a seriously less robust vehicle. Mind that paint!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one shouldn’t get too mardy, because the sun <em>is</em> out, the riding is fine, and I’ve had this lot to spur me on my way…</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tunisia-diaries-london-to-girondelle\">Tunisia Diaries: From London to Girondelle</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/netflix-unchained-review\">Netflix’s Tour de France Unchained review: An entertaining recap with a Pogačar-shaped hole</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Brompton C-Line Explore</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-970x646.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line.jpg 1196w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some bloke pulled over when I was taking these pictures and asked if he could buy the Brompton. He was in a car, yet he knew he needed the new C-Line Explore in his life. And as if <em>I </em>needed any more convincing on the matter, my partner told me that I look a bit of a wally riding it (which we both know is code for ‘you’re having too much fun’), while this morning the guard at Bristol Temple Meads station told me he liked the colour. And that guy must see a lot of Bromptons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am incredibly late to the Brompton party I know, but my goodness if this isn’t an incredible bike. The functionality of the design is just stunning. I’m blown away.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-970x646.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Brompton-C_Line-3.jpg 1323w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m going to write a full review in time – there’s too much to say for just here – but for now the headlines are the C-Line is Brompton’s latest revised line of folding bikes, once previously called things like the S6E or M6R.

My most faithful pair of overshoes is from Pearl (the Pro Barrier WxB since you ask) and they are remarkable in that I’ve worn them for much of every winter since 2013 and they’re still going strong.

First, because they are orange, and I just like orange. Second, because the Sutro’s general shape is simple yet retro, harking back to the old days of Phil Anderson and Greg LeMond in their Oakley Eyeshades, while the ‘Lite’ and ‘Sweep’ bits here mean these Sutros are half frames (no under the eye parts) and the lenses are scooped away a bit at the bottom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drilled holes are also wonderfully retro but they also really do a fine job of reducing – nay, near eliminating – fogging. However, what is systematically impressive across Oakley’s range and here employed to full effect are the Sutro’s Prizm lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-970x646.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Oakley-Sutro-Lite-Sweep-MDVP-5.jpg 1890w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oakley’s Prizm lenses are tuned to filter out certain light frequencies, which thereby boosts the contrast between certain colours.
