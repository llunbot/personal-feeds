The former version of Recall recorded screenshots and OCR text of all user activity, and stored it unencrypted on disk where it could easily be accessed by another user on the PC or an attacker with remote access.</p>\n\n<p>The feature was announced in late May, without having gone through any of the public Windows Insider testing that most new Windows features get, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/microsoft-makes-recall-feature-off-by-default-after-security-and-privacy-backlash/\">was scheduled</a> to ship on new PCs by June 18; by June 13, the company had delayed it indefinitely to rearchitect it and said that it would be tested through the normal channels before it was rolled out to the public.</p>\n<p>Today, Microsoft shared more extensive details on exactly how the security of Recall has been re-architected in <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179096\">a post</a> by Microsoft VP of Enterprise and OS Security David Weston.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052960#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052960&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a37147e0f2367fb47a17613a27b2e41acea77f0184b5894c24a301a604fa3177","category":"Tech"}
