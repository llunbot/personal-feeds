As noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/11/apple-to-pay-up-to-500-million-to-iphone-users-after-judge-nixes-final-appeal/\">The Mercury News</a></em>, the judge overseeing the lawsuit has thrown out an appeal from two ‌iPhone‌ owners who were attempting to object to the settlement, clearing the way for the payments to be sent out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/03/iPhone_6s.jpg\" alt width=\"800\" height=\"449\" />\r<br />\nApple in 2020 agreed to pay $500 to settle the \"batterygate\" lawsuit, which accused the company of secretly throttling older ‌iPhone‌ models. The class action lawsuit was open to U.S. customers who had an ‌iPhone‌ 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, or 7 Plus running iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 11.2 prior to December 21, 2017.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lawsuit stemmed from the iOS 10.2.1 update that Apple released in 2017. The software tweaked the performance of older iPhones with degraded batteries to prevent them from shutting down. The processor was effectively throttled down because the battery could not keep up, and some users saw slower performance speeds when this occurred. The only way to restore full performance was to replace the degraded battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did not initially tell customers that iOS 10.2.1 introduced performance throttling, which outraged consumers and led to a major headache for Apple, including this class action lawsuit. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/\">ultimately apologized</a> for its lack of communication and dropped the price of battery replacements to $29 through the end of 2018.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPhone‌ owners eligible for a payout would have needed to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/13/iphone-slowdown-lawsuit-notification/\">submit a claim back in 2020</a>, and submissions were open through October 6, 2020. Those who submitted a claim back then will be eligible for a payment, which will be around $65 per claimant.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/14/apple-batterygate-iphone-lawsuit/\">Apple Will Soon Send Payments in $500 Million 'Batterygate' iPhone Throttling Lawsuit</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-will-soon-send-payments-in-500-million-batterygate-iphone-throttling-lawsuit.2398646/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"162b4be321d3b247e3a94999c12ac2de7f1bb0f9d71781ba7dc11122524f71e4","category":"Apple"}
