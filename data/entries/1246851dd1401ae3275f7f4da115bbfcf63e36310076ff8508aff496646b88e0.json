Examples are the BMC <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-kaius-review\">Kaius </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bmc-urs-gravel-bike-2024\">URS </a>and the Cannondale <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-superx-gravel-bike\">SuperX</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-carbon-2-l-review\">Topstone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still plenty of find do-it-all gravel bikes though, if you’re not sure where your gravel allegiances lie. Adventure gravel bikes won’t hold you back unless you’re on the pointy end of gravel racing. Indeed, Matej Mohorič even won the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/matej-mohoric-gravel-worlds-bike\">2023 UCI Gravel World Championships </a>on<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/matej-mohoric-gravel-worlds-bike\"> </a>a Merida Silex, one of the bikes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But adventure gravel bikes are designed to offer a stable geometry and tyre clearance now often exceeds 50mm. Wider tyres still on 650b wheels may be an option. You’ll get a full set of mounting points for bags and bottles and maybe internal routing for dynamo cables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are our picks of the best gravel adventure bikes we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist</em> and further down you’ll find a short buyer’s guide to what to look for in an adventure gravel bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best gravel adventure bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>3T Exploro Ultra – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-ultra-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>3T Extrema Italia – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-extrema-italia-gravel-bike-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cannondale Topstone Carbon – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-carbon-2-l-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Grizl – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-grizl-gravel-bike\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fara F/Gravel – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fara-f-gravel-bike-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giant Revolt X – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Merida Silex – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/merida-silex-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open Wide – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/open-wide-gravel-bike-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized Diverge STR – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust <em>Cyclist</em>‘s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"3T Extrema Italia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/3T-Extrema-Italia-10-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We like a bit of adventure at <em>Cyclist</em>.

That allows you to fit 46mm 700c or the preferred 650b tyres in 61mm width, with 3T saying the Ultra is for riders looking for in-town as well as gravel performance. As with the Extrema Ultra, the Ultra’s frame is aero tuned for the wide tyres, while the geometry leads to a fast ride on tarmac, with the 419mm chainstay length short for a bike with so much clearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3T makes a lot of the components on our test bike, including the 1x Torno carbon crankset and the wheels, contributing to a low 8.4kg bike weight, even with the dropper post. With the wide tyres, there’s enough cushioning to offset the frame stiffness and the Ultra is adroit on tougher terrain, although it’s not quite as off-road oriented as the 3T Extrema Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-ultra-review\">3T Exploro Ultra review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a

road</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for massive tyre clearance, even with a 2x groupset? The 3T Extrema Italia is the bike for you, with 57mm 700c tyre clearance while still offering claimed aero benefits. That opens up MTB terrain, while the massive 75mm wide down tube is claimed to still be aero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is built to order in Italy and can be configured for different groupsets.

We were impressed by the Diverge STR’s capacity to smooth the terrain when seated, although there’s some work required to tune the suspension to get the best ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full  <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\">Specialized Diverge STR review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><br /></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gravel adventure bikes: what to look for</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 0 review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-0-review-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Here are the key features to look for in a gravel bike geared for adventure, rather than one aimed at gravel racing and fast gravel rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stable handling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A gravel adventure bike will usually have <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\">geometry </a>that makes for a stable ride. That usually equates to a long wheelbase, slack head tube angle of around 70 degrees, and longer trail. The chainstays will often be a little longer too, in part to accommodate wider tyres, in part to aid stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike’s stability will set it up for rides on trickier terrain and steeper descents. It’s also useful when you’re loaded up with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\">bikepacking bags</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Big tyre clearance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyre clearance for adventure gravel bikes is getting ever-wider. While a few years ago 40mm was considered wide, now it’s not uncommon to see 50mm clearance or more. The extra rubber on the trail aids grip and rollover of obstacles and helps on climbs and descents. It also allows you to lower tyre pressure for more ride comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>650b wheels and tyres are still an option, although they’re falling out of favour and many of the best gravel adventure bikes now sport 700c wheels. The smaller 650b wheel size typically allows you to fit even wider tyres, although with modern wide-range gravel bike gearing the argument that these will provide a  similar rolling radius to a narrower tyre on a 700c wheel and hence similar gearing is now less significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wide range gearing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\">gravel bike gearing</a>. Almost all gravel groupsets now provide gear ratios down to 1:1 and usually below that, thanks to subcompact cranksets and wide-range cassettes. Gear range (the difference in ratios between the highest and lowest gears) is now typically over 400%, so you’re not too compromised on faster sections or when riding on tarmac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1x gearing is an alternative to 2x for almost all gravel bike groupsets, often offering as much or more range than a 2x set-up, with small jumps in ratios thanks to 12 or 13 sprockets in the cassette. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/gravel-bike-groupsets\">Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo</a> all offer 1x gravel bike groupsets, with Shimano and SRAM also selling 2x options for gravel. If you want lower gearing, a mullet build can take your ratios even lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suspension</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many brands incorporate suspension systems in their adventure gravel bikes. Rather than the heavy, long travel suspension systems seen on mountain bikes, these typically offer around 30 or 40mm of travel, with little weight penalty. Examples are Cannondale’s Kingpin rear suspension and Specialized’s Future Shock system, seen at the front in the standard <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-s-works-diverge-review\">Specialized Diverge</a> and both front and rear in the Diverge STR.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A short travel suspension fork is also an option, such as on the Giant Revolt X. Even if a bike doesn’t come with one, many now have a shorter head tube so that they’re forward compatible with a suspension fork, should you wish to upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if there’s no active suspension system, adventure gravel bike frames typically include compliance zones and features in the rear triangle, such as that seen in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/gt-grade-carbon-pro-le-review\" target=\"_blank\">GT Grade C</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/gt-grade-carbon-pro-le-review\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/gt-grade-carbon-pro-le-review\" target=\"_blank\">rbon</a>, designed to provide passive ride smoothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dropper post compatibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many adventure gravel bikes are compatible with a dropper seatpost and provide ports for internal cable routing. Some are sold with a dropper post already installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve questioned the need for a dropper post for most UK riding, although it might be handy if you’re planning to ride your gravel bike somewhere more extreme. Some dropper posts have a small amount of travel built in when they’re locked out, aiding saddle comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mounting points</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect a full set of mounting points on a gravel adventure bike, so you can lash a set of bikepacking bags to your bike for the myriad <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-essentials\">bikepacking essentials</a>. That usually includes fork leg mounts, as well as frame mounts and three sets of bottle bosses. You’ll often have scope for internal dynamo cable routing through the right hand fork leg and sometimes the frame too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, gravel race bikes may forego some mounting points, particularly those on the forks and may not be compatible with mudguards to preserve their close clearances.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-adventure-bikes\">Best gravel adventure bikes 2025 reviewed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1246851dd1401ae3275f7f4da115bbfcf63e36310076ff8508aff496646b88e0","category":"Cycling"}
