The idea is to give racers three options – the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-ride-the-specialized-epic-ht-is-a-rad-race-hardtail/\">Epic Hardtail</a> (<em>which is likely due for a refresh itself</em>), the Epic World Cup, and the Epic S-Works – plus an Epic EVO model for riders who want something more playful but still fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get to the specific models and their differences, let’s look at what’s new with the frame and why they changed what they did…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the TL;DR on the new Specialized Epic?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of words and pictures below this, but if you only want the highlights, here ya go:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Epic 8 has more travel – 120mm rear with 120-130mm forks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frames are lighter despite adding SWAT storage and being longer &amp; slacker</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s faster thanks to new kinematics, no BRAIN shock needed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Yes, the S-Works model is ridiculously expensive</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious? Grab a coffee and let’s dive in…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why have so many Epic options?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-S-Works-Epic-World-Cup-hero-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"818\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-S-Works-Epic-World-Cup-hero-.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Epic World Cup hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-S-Works-Epic-World-Cup-hero-.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-S-Works-Epic-World-Cup-hero--297x190.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-S-Works-Epic-World-Cup-hero--800x511.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-S-Works-Epic-World-Cup-hero--120x77.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-S-Works-Epic-World-Cup-hero--768x491.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The Epic World Cup, introduced in 2023, uses a short-travel integrated rear shock.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a model that’s been in the line as long as the Epic, you have to ask, what’s left to change?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The better question might be, how have riders and courses changed? And what needs to change on a bike to keep up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier<em>, </em>Specialized launched the Epic World Cup (WC, <em>shown above</em>), with a semi-integrated rear shock, short 75mm rear travel, and the lightest possible frame. IMO, it eliminates any need for a hardtail altogether, potentially giving Specialized a single model for every XC race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was a bit of a surprise to see two additional new Epics launch just months later, but Specialized says these two new options give riders the right tool for the job, no matter what type of course they’re up against.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Justification for the Epic 8</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02.jpg\" alt=\"2024 specialized epic 8 s-works xc mountain bike shown from low front side angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prior Epic had 100mm rear wheel travel with a BRAIN-equipped shock, which meant it was more complex yet with barely more  travel than the new WC model in the rear. And with 100mm forks, it had 10mm <em>less travel</em> than the new WC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Epic 8 bumps up to 120mm rear wheel travel with matching 120mm forks, making it a much more capable bike than the WC when things get rowdy. It’s purpose-built for modern UCI XCO tracks, where efficiency and weight can’t come at the expense of capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 specialized epic 8 s-works\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-23.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In their words, the new Epic 8 is <em>“Fastest for XC Racing”</em>, which may seem like an odd claim when the World Cup model exists, so let’s back up a sec. The Epic World Cup is <em>“Fastest on SMOOTH XC tracks”</em>, which means two things. For top pros who have to use the same bike for both short track and XC courses, it’s a good compromise between a hardtail and a full suspension bike when the XC course isn’t too aggressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us without a team truck and a six-figure racing budget, it’s a great option for amateur racers who live in flat terrain and want suspension but don’t need much of it and want the lightest possible bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Justification for the Epic 8 EVO</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1413\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01-297x210.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01-800x565.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01-120x85.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01-768x543.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-01-1536x1085.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prior Epic EVO had 110mm rear travel with 120mm forks. The new Epic 8 EVO has the same frame as the standard Epic 8, with the same 120mm rear wheel travel, but fork travel increases to 130mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the standard Epic is for racers, the Epic 8 EVO is for people who might occasionally race but mostly want a fast bike that’s also fun. Specialized suspects most riders wanting a short travel bike will be best served by the EVO model, and I agree. You’ll see why further down in this post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Specialized Epic 8 tech details &amp; features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17.jpg\" alt=\"frame weight for 2024 specialized epic 8 s-works\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-17-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Impressively, the new S-Works level Epic 8 frame is 76g lighter than the prior S-Works Epic. The frame, with all hardware, including the rear axle (<em>which threads into the T-Type derailleur, hence the open dropout in the pic</em>) and a non-Flight Attendant shock is just 1.81kg (3.99lb).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they could have made it lighter if they were making a bike that was <em>only</em> for racing. But they wanted something that’s very capable and instills confidence. And convenient…the SWAT system adds a bit of weight, but it’s worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it has more travel than before, with a longer, slacker frame, and an integrated steering stop so your handlebar won’t smash your top tube. Which makes the sub-4lb weight very impressive!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Epic 8 EVO frames are up to 120-130g lighter than before, depending on size, but are overall a bit heavier for reasons you’ll soon see.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, how did they drop weight?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 specialized epic 8 s-works rear shock and linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-21-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To cut weight across all frames, they eliminated all compression-molded carbon parts, which are often used for thicker sections like shock mounts. Those parts add weight and usually need to be bonded on, which adds filler (<em>aka</em> more weight).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Specialized designed the forward shock mounts directly into the layup and bladder-molded top tube, then machine away the spots where they attach the mounting hardware. This section alone saved ~24g, allowing more continuous fibers for a stronger tube. For S-Works, they went further and made a carbon fiber shock extension at the yoke, plus a titanium shock mount, extension bolt, and internal pivot hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 specialized epic 8 s-works rear triangle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They also cut weight with smaller dropouts and slimmer seatstays (reduced diameter), which is fine because most of the stiffness comes from the chainstays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S-Works frames use their top-level FACT 12M carbon, which they say is incredibly expensive, but it’s stiffer and stronger so they can use less of it. Inside, there are no internal tubes for cable guides other than the rear brake, which saves weight from the tubes and also the extra bonding required to connect them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-12-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below the S-Works level are FACT 11M frames, which have a bit more carbon, but are designed to have the same exact ride quality and stiffness. These do have internal guides for mechanical rear derailleur and dropper post routing, which adds a bit more weight, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And standard Epic 8 frames are up to 120-130g lighter than before, depending on size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about ride quality?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 specialized epic 8 s-works rear brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-14-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All frames have size-specific layups and tube shapes, letting them optimize for different rider sizes and weights.

It comes with really short stems and a bit longer reach. They tested a lot, with a custom-built test mule frame that let them try different head angles, reach, etc. They pushed it until it was ‘crazy”, then dialed back a bit before bringing in the team riders for their input. Beyond modernizing the geometry and increasing travel, the real ride quality improvements come from the suspension…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tricky suspension tuning FTW</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 specialized epic 8 s-works flight attendant rear shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-16-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, their Ride Dynamics engineers start with the desired kinematics and ride performance, then figure out how to make it happen. Some of that comes from the frame, and some from the fork and shock. Specialized works with the suspension brands to get custom tunes on both. This is somewhat unique – most brands get custom tunes for the rear shock, but not many brands go to the trouble to do custom tunes for the fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just done by feel. Their team has backgrounds in F1 and Trophy Trucks, plus some of the same testing equipment used in those industries to verify performance improvements and apply all of that to their full-suspension bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1900\" height=\"1561\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart.jpg\" alt=\"specialized epic rear shock tune compression chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart.jpg 1900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart-297x244.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart-800x657.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart-120x99.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart-768x631.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/specialized-epic-magic-middle-shock-curve-tune-chart-1536x1262.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear shock has three modes, like most shocks. The lockout mode is very stiff like racers want, but the “Magic Middle” Pedal Mode setting is where, well, the magic happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they tuned the damper with more <em>low-speed</em> compression damping to resist pedal inputs and support the rider when cranking through little rollers and small bumps. But the <em>high-speed</em> compression damping matches the Open mode so that it can quickly and fully react to big bumps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, they removed all of the shock’s volume spacers <em>and</em> the bottom-out bumper to give them a lot more air volume. This gives it a plush feel that can easily get deeper into the stroke for a more bottomless feel. The combination means good pedaling support and a shock that’s also very active when you need it to be. Magic, indeed, and they say this middle setting is where you’ll want to be 80% of the time during a race.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2092\" height=\"1290\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts.jpg\" alt=\"diagram showing rockshox flight attendants parts on new specialized epic 8 s-works\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts.jpg 2092w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts-297x183.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts-800x493.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts-120x74.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts-768x474.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts-1536x947.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-flight-attendant-parts-2048x1263.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>The yellow lines mean the RockShox Flight Attendant is monitoring and adjusting everything.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top models get Flight Attendant to manage all those modes for you, and lower models use a three-position TwistLoc remote. As convenient as the TwistLoc is, on a multi-hour or multi-day race, that’s still a lot of mental processing to manage, so they made that middle mode a sweet spot that works great for almost everything.

The Flight Attendant bikes just give you more customization options, which <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rockshox-flight-attendant-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">I covered in this post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>It’s slightly different for the EVO models.</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10.jpg\" alt=\"2024 epic 8 evo closeup on fox shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-10-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Epic 8 EVO suspension loses the Magic Middle mode, it’s just Open and Lock. These bikes also have no remote lockout, relying on a custom-tuned, two-position Fox Float shock. The Open mode has minimal compression damping, and the Sprint (Lockout) mode keeps it really firm. Both work quite well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of which version and shock you get, the new Epic 8 has 20% less pedal bob in the “open” shock setting than the prior model, but without diminishing the suspension’s ability to remain active when pedaling. They say it’s also 12% smoother, with the frame able to absorb more vibration and bump forces, which means fewer of those forces reach the rider, so you stay fresher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>There’s also adjustable geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-geometry-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-geometry-chart-800x570.jpg\" alt=\"2024 specialized epic 8 geometry chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-geometry-chart-800x570.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-geometry-chart-297x212.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-geometry-chart-120x85.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-geometry-chart-768x547.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-geometry-chart.jpg 1452w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-geometry-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-geometry-chart-800x570.jpg\" alt=\"2024 specialized epic 8 EVO geometry chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-geometry-chart-800x570.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-geometry-chart-297x212.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-geometry-chart-120x85.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-geometry-chart-768x547.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-geometry-chart.jpg 1452w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time, the Specialized Epic gets adjustable geometry via a flip chip at the rear shock mount.

It looks great, but any time you’re running brake hoses or cables through the headset bearing, there are concerns. Shops hate to work on them, and the holes in the headset cover introduce opportunities for water and dust ingress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized acknowledges this, so their cover has a small rubber port with flaps to guide big stuff away, and they say they haven’t had a problem with water ingress unless you’re “pushing it in there” when washing your bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 specialized epic 8 s-works turning radius\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-s-works-details-11-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for service, the only time you’d have to cut or separate the brake hose is if you need to replace the upper headset bearing.

Just flip the lever open and pull off the cover (which doubles as the downtube’s bottle cage mounting spot).

Or buy the standard Epic 8 to get the three-mode “Magic Middle” rear shock, then put bigger tires and a longer fork on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the prior Epic EVO was their racers’ bike of choice for most XCO tracks in 2023, which also explains why the non-EVO bikes got a big boost in travel and capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07.jpg\" alt=\"2024 epic 8 evo tire clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-specialized-epic-8-EVO-trail-downcountry-MTB-07-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But that means the new Epic 8 EVO can focus more on fun, aiming squarely at the light trail/downcountry rider.
