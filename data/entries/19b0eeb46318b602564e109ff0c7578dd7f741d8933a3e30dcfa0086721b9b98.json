He did not say which generation of foldable it would be.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Gurman had previously said he expects Apple's first book-style foldable iPhone to be released next year, so it was presumed that the \"foldable version\" he said is coming in 2027 would be a second iteration of that model. Kuo's latest report therefore appears to back up this interpretation.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable/\">foldable</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-second-foldable-iphone-2027-launch/\">Apple's Second Foldable iPhone Set for 2027 Launch, Claims Kuo</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-second-foldable-iphone-set-for-2027-launch-claims-kuo.2456520/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"19b0eeb46318b602564e109ff0c7578dd7f741d8933a3e30dcfa0086721b9b98","category":"Apple"}
