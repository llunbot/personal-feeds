It's a real problem, especially if you have butter fingers. Gorilla Glass maker Corning has announced a new material that might help save the day the next time you drop a phone. The company claims its latest Gorilla Glass Ceramic can withstand drops that would shatter lesser materials.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, Corning's new glass incorporates ceramic components to improve strength compared to other types of hardened glass. Corning has offered a bit of data to support this claim. In its <a href=\"https://www.corning.com/microsites/csm/gorillaglass/PI_Sheets/CGG_Gorilla%20Glass%20Ceramic_PI%20Sheet.pdf\">lab tests</a> (PDF), Gorilla Glass Ceramic withstood 10 drops from one meter onto surfaces that closely resemble asphalt. Why Corning does not use real asphalt for this test is unclear. Regardless, <a href=\"https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/about-us/news-events/news-releases/2025/03/corning-launches-corning-gorilla-glass-ceramic-expanding-renowned-portfolio-of-tough-cover-materials.html\">the company says</a> an unspecified \"competitive\" type of aluminosilicate glass would typically fail on the first drop.</p>\n<p>Chemically strengthened glass has been a key component in the proliferation of smartphones across the world. Since the company provided the glass for that first iPhone back in 2007, it has made glass for more than 7 billion devices. That makes Corning the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/corning-faces-antitrust-actions-for-its-gorilla-glass-dominance/\">largest glass supplier in the mobile industry</a>, but it does face increasing competition in the budget and midrange segments.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/cornings-new-apple-like-ceramic-glass-might-save-your-next-phone-from-disaster/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/cornings-new-apple-like-ceramic-glass-might-save-your-next-phone-from-disaster/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b694db59fdbd82be83af52d3063d23b447070023e8c8656d491f20143e1e953","category":"Tech"}
