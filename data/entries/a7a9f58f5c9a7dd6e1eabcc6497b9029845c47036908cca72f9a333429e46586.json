This likely means there is some sort of thruster issue on the spacecraft that is preventing it from being able to orient itself back toward Earth.</p>\n<p>\"Since then, we have implemented various measures to restore service, but communication has not yet been restored,\" the agency stated. \"We are currently working on restoring communication.\" JAXA added that it will announce further actions, if any, as soon as they've been decided upon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027316#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027316&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7a9f58f5c9a7dd6e1eabcc6497b9029845c47036908cca72f9a333429e46586","category":"Tech"}
