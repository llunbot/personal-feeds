We’re not animals, after all, or worse… mountain bikers.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/il-lombardia-favourites\">Who are the favourites for Il Lombardia 2023?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/london-bike-kitchen\">London Bike Kitchen: We’re here to fix things</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">Best road bike pedals 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>I can understand how people might feel that a road cycling magazine should stick to just that: the road. But I would argue that gravel is an extension of the road scene rather than a defection to a different tribe. The aesthetic is much the same, if a touch more relaxed; the bikes are very similar in looks and ride style; and the roads are still roads, just a bit bumpier and with less chance of being crushed by an articulated lorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If road surface is the real issue with gravel riding, then I would point out that some of the most iconic and well-loved road races – Paris-Roubaix, Tour of Flanders, Strade Bianche – are held on surfaces that are anything but smooth. If the issue is with the bikes and their wide tyres, then I would point to the fact that increased tyre volume offers better comfort, grip and rolling resistance and is a standard feature of most road bikes these days. Even the Specialized Tarmac (the clue’s in the name) is built to take 32mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel isn’t a threat to road cycling, it’s a chance to expand horizons, explore further and get a new perspective. For those unconvinced by my reasoning, then fear not, we are still dedicated to the smooth stuff (you might want to skip our Big Ride and go straight to our Passo Sella ride), but hopefully you’ll forgive us the occasional foray into the wilds. A bit of dirt never did anyone any harm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Juan Trujillo Andrades</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 145?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beyond and back:</strong> The Transnevada trail wraps itself around Spain’s Sierra Nevada, taking you deeper into the wilds of these Andalusian mountains than any conventional route allows. <em>Cyclist</em> travels to the region of Alpujarra for an adventure along its southernmost stretch</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The trials of time:</strong> Swiss rider Marlen Reusser capped a stellar year with victory in the Stage 8 time-trial at the Tour de France. She talks <em>Cyclist</em> through the details of the race, and the mental and physical toll it has taken</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>75 years later…:</strong> The last venue from the 1948 Olympics still in use is Herne Hill racetrack in South London. <em>Cyclist</em> pays a visit to the anniversary race meet, and learns about its rich history</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Passo Sella:</strong> The ancient coral reef that became a fabled rock of the Giro d’Italia</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So you want to ride around the world?</strong> Circumnavigating the planet is the ultimate challenge on two wheels. But before you set off, heed the words of those who have done it before</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Across the Andes:</strong> The Rat Race Trans Andean involves nine days and 1,517km of riding from one side of South America to the other – but apparently anyone can do it. Cyclist finds out how true that really is</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all this and much more, pick up your copy of <em>Cyclist</em> issue 145, <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-145\" target=\"_blank\">on sale now</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Subscribe to <em>Cyclist</em> and get the best bikes, rides and cycling exclusives</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get three months of <em>Cyclist</em> for just £1.67 an issue (usually £6.45), delivered free of charge to your door before it hits the shops</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://cyclistmag.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to find out more and subscribe to Cyclist Magazine</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-145\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to buy Cyclist issue 145 at the Cyclist Shop</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 145: on sale now!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"420069c5e4d36637acccfeb9013fdc70789635e03b0c18240d71fc720121a6b7","category":"Cycling"}
