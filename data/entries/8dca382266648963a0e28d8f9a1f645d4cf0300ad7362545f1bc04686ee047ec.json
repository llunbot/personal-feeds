The higher the mAh rating of a battery, the more charge it can hold, and the longer it can power a device. The following table shows the battery capacity comparison between the iPhone 15 Pro models and iPhone 16 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 15 Pros (2023)</th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 16 Pros (2024)</th>\r<br />\n <th>% Change</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n <th>Pro</th>\r<br />\n <td>3,274 mAh</td>\r<br />\n <td>3,577 mAh</td>\r<br />\n <td>+9.25%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Max</th>\r<br />\n <td>4,422 mAh</td>\r<br />\n <td>4,676 mAh</td>\r<br />\n <td>+5.74%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>The change in capacity of the iPhone 16 Pro over the previous Pro model shows the most marked difference, with an over 9% increase (303 mAh). Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while not as dramatic as its smaller sibling, gets an over 5% increase (254 mAh). Combined with efficiency improvements, the increases should see both devices offer more sustained real-world usage on a single charge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to one <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223409700148&amp;navType=by\">rumor</a>, this year's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will boast a 30-hour-plus battery life (compared to 29 hours for the iPhone 15 Pro Max). Not only that, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/iphone-15-could-feature-stacked-battery-technology/\">stacked battery technology</a> for increased energy density and prolonged lifespan. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/iphone-16-pro-max-biggest-rumored-features/\">5 Biggest Changes Rumored for iPhone 16 Pro Max</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nBoth devices are also rumored to support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/iphone-16-pro-40w-fast-charging-20w-magsafe/\">40W wired fast charging and 20W MagSafe charging</a>.
