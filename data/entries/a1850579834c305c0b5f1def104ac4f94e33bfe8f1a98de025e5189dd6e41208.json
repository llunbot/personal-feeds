Both the main and front-facing cameras are expected to receive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/iphone-se-4-camera-details-revealed/\">major upgrades</a> to 48- and 12-megapixel sensors, respectively. Contrary to earlier rumors, the device is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/latest-iphone-se-4-dummy-images-show-notch/\">no longer expected</a> to feature the Camera Control, Action Button, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is highly likely to be the first to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/\">Apple's custom 5G modem</a>. While it won't feature mmWave connectivity and may be slower than the Qualcomm components currently used in iPhones, it is expected to offer lower power consumption, improved cellular network scanning, and satellite connectivity enhancements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 is due to be released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/ios-18-3-build-for-iphone-se-4-leak/\">before iOS 18.4</a>, sometime around <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april/\">March or April</a>. It is expected to be slightly more expensive than the current model with a price point of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/30/iphone-se-4-could-be-more-expensive/\">about $470</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe also look ahead to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-watch-se-3-everything-we-know/\">Apple Watch SE 3</a>, which is expected to debut later this year. With an all-new plastic casing that evokes the ‌iPhone‌ 5C, we reflect on the direction of Apple's entry-level devices. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> also has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div>Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also listen to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5096144.rss\">copy our RSS feed</a> directly into your podcast player.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIf you haven't already listened to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/the-macrumors-show-samsung-2025-challenge/\">previous episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, catch up for our discussion about how Samsung's latest announcements challenge Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSubscribe to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ for new episodes every week, where we discuss some of the topical news breaking here on <em>MacRumors</em>, often joined by interesting guests such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/15/the-macrumors-show-apple-pro-apps-updates/\">Kevin Nether</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/the-macrumors-show-jon-prosser-talks-m4-macs/\">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/the-macrumors-show-luke-miani-talks-apple-watch-x/\">Luke Miani</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/the-macrumors-show-matthew-cassinelli/\">Matthew Cassinelli</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/the-macrumors-show-brian-tong-vision-pro/\">Brian Tong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/the-macrumors-show-one-week-with-vision-pro/\">Quinn Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Jared Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Eli Hodapp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/the-macrumors-show-former-apple-executive-mike-bell/\">Mike Bell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/the-macrumors-show-sara-dietschy-apple-accessories/\">Sara Dietschy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/the-macrumors-show-ijustine-talks-iphone-15/\">iJustine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/the-macrumors-show-iphone-15-jon-rettinger/\">Jon Rettinger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/10/the-macrumors-show-andru-edwards-iphone-ultra/\">Andru Edwards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/the-macrumors-show-arnold-kim/\">Arnold Kim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/the-macrumors-show-ben-sullins-apple-car/\">Ben Sullins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/07/the-macrumors-show-marcus-kane-headset-design/\">Marcus Kane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/the-macrumors-show-christopher-lawley-talks-ipados/\">Christopher Lawley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/the-macrumors-show-frank-mcshan-yellow-iphone-14/\">Frank McShan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/the-macrumors-show-david-lewis-talks-apple-audio/\">David Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/the-macrumors-show-tyler-stalman-new-macs/\">Tyler Stalman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/02/the-macrumors-show-apple-event-expectations/\">Sam Kohl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/the-macrumors-show-john-gruber-talks-macos-ventura/\">John Gruber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/the-macrumors-show-ipados-16-ft-federico-viticci/\">Federico Viticci</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/26/the-macrumors-show-thomas-frank-talks-productivity/\">Thomas Frank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/21/the-macrumors-show-jonathan-morrison/\">Jonathan Morrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/the-macrumors-show-ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/21/the-macrumors-show-ian-zelbo/\">Ian Zelbo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/the-macrumors-show-rene-ritchie-talks-mac-studio/\">Rene Ritchie</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌The MacRumors Show‌ is on X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\">@MacRumorsShow</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\"></a>, so be sure to give us a follow to keep up with the podcast.
