Cutting corners and drafting vehicles… let’s just say Safa takes some calculated risks on this decent, reaching speeds of over 50 MPH in certain spots. Nothing that hasn’t been done before of course, but Safa captures the whole thing with a 360° camera, which makes for some pretty cool viewing. It starts getting good at around 3 minutes in.</p><p><span><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rC0n7kPvAKY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" ezoid=\"0.7508621930994221\"></iframe></span></p><p><em>“As I mentioned during the ride I was not going to set any records this day but the conditions turned out to be fairly fast with minimal traffic and a clean road surface. I ended up shaving a few seconds off the fastest time on Las Flores which was a nice surprise, Strava link below. I’ve been putting a lot of runs down here for when the time is right to film a full blown Descent Disciples attempt. Practice makes perfect as the saying goes”</em> – Safa Brian.</p><p>How did Safa get this footage?
