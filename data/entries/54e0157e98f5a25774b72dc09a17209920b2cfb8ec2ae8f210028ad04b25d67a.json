{"title":"Tracy Moseley: Trailblazing the way for the future of mountain biking","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tracy-moseley-trailblazing-the-way-for-the-future-of-mountain-biking","date":1734429060000,"content":"\n      <p><span>The district of Malvern is surrounded by countryside. Some say that if you venture to the high points of the Malvern Hills, you can find the best views in England: dark green and orange panoramas interrupted only by quaint clusters of houses and cottages. For mountain biking, the hills are a playground. Trails weave up and down muddy banks like the tracks of a rollercoaster, perfect training ground for honing skills and getting a healthy adrenaline boost for good measure. It’s no wonder, then, that so much off-road talent comes from this small but special area of English countryside.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Tracy Moseley is one rider who has become synonymous with the Malvern Hills. The British woman grew up on a rural farm in Malvern and got into cycling alongside her brother as they both rode bikes for fun. When Moseley got the chance to race for the first time, her talent was immediately clear: the trails and mountain bike community in Malvern had a future star in their ranks.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TMX02600_1024x1024.jpg?v=1734445683\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><span>For 11 years, during which she became a world champion in the discipline, Moseley raced downhill professionally, setting an example for all of those watching her back home in Malvern. When she believed she had accomplished everything in downhill racing, Moseley wasn’t done with the sport, however. In 2011, professional enduro mountain biking was evolving, so the British woman decided to give it a try. Within one year, Moseley was racing in the World Enduro Series and challenging for victories at the highest level – a testament to her natural talent in the sport, Within three years, she had three more world titles.</span></p>\n<p><span>But Moseley's personal achievements on two wheels don’t tell the full story of her contribution to the sport. Both during her career and now she is retired, Moseley was instrumental in encouraging participation in mountain biking and being a mentor to the next generation, helping the likes of former UCI short track and cyclo-cross world champion Evie Richards to success in the sport.</span></p>\n<p><span>“With Evie, to have seen someone who was 14 or 15 years old get to cycling and see that transition, and actually be there when she won the World Championships on the sidelines cheering was special,” Moseley says, speaking a few moments before being inducted into the <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/article/20241024-13-NEW-INDUCTEES-INTO-THE-BRITISH-CYCLING-HALL-OF-FAME-0\">British Cycling Hall of Fame</a> as recognition for her contribution to the sport. “This year, when she won the short track, I happened to be there at that Worlds as well. It was amazing just to see that transition from just a girl on the hills at home to being world champion in the sport.”</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/SW1_1210_1024x1024.jpg?v=1734445717\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><span>While Moseley speaks passionately about the growth she has seen in off-road disciplines in recent years, she also notes that there’s work to be done so that more riders like Richards can come through the ranks and perform on a world stage.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Mountain biking is having an interesting time at the moment. Certainly mountain bike racing, we've had Warner Brothers Discovery take over the broadcast, and that has definitely affected the structure of the racing, and we're not seeing so many events taking place,” Moseley reflects. “I think now is a really good time where I feel we need to go back to the grassroots. We need to really invest in the clubs and that lower tier of racing. It's such an amazing sport. People are out there riding mountain bikes in forests every weekend, we just need to get that grass roots racing going again and build that enthusiasm.”</span></p>\n<p><span>For Moseley, seeing other people discover the same joy she has found through mountain biking has been a highlight of her time in the sport, which is why she has dedicated so much time and energy to it for decades. The legacy she leaves behind isn’t about race results, but about inspiring those who will come next to discover the good that cycling can bring to an individual’s life.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I love seeing the enjoyment people get out of racing. I had a lifetime and a career out riding bikes. I never really expected to have met the people I’ve met and travelled to the places I’ve travelled to,” she says. “When you start to see young people suddenly get bitten by that same bug that is cycling, it’s brilliant. Even if they move on and get jobs or go to university, I still see kids that were in our cycling club 10 or 15 years ago who love riding their bikes. It’s not about if they become world champions or not, it’s about if they love cycling and if it will always be a part of their lives. If I can help someone discover that, it’s a huge achievement.”</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"54e0157e98f5a25774b72dc09a17209920b2cfb8ec2ae8f210028ad04b25d67a","category":"Cycling"}
