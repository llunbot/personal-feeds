According to the source, Apple is working on \"a higher refresh rate LCD display with a new liquid motion panel fixed at around 90Hz,\" with plans to implement the technology across multiple products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSuch a development would be particularly noteworthy for the Studio Display, which hasn't received any hardware updates since its March 2022 launch. Many Apple users had hoped to see a refreshed model before the end of 2024, amid on-again, off-again rumors about a potential upgrade featuring mini-LED technology and ProMotion support. Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR has also remained unchanged since its 2019 debut.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisplay analyst Ross Young, who is known for accurate predictions about Apple's display technology, reported in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-cancelled/\">April 2023</a> that Apple had abandoned plans for a 27-inch monitor with mini-LED backlighting. That canceled project, which could have been a next-generation Studio Display, was said to include the use of ProMotion technology with refresh rates up to 120Hz. Earlier, Young had anticipated such a display launching in 2022, but the release never materialized.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the anonymous source, the 90Hz display technology will debut first in the next-generation M3 iPad Air, expected in early 2025, before expanding to other products. The 24-inch iMac, which just received an M4 update, likely wouldn't see this display improvement until late 2025 at the earliest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current Studio Display features a 27-inch 5K LCD panel with 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color support, and up to 600 nits brightness, starting at $1,599.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/apple-working-on-90hz-studio-display-imac-ipad-air/\">Apple Reportedly Working on 90Hz Studio Display, iMac, iPad Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-working-on-90hz-studio-display-imac-ipad-air.2442047/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5839f69c00ef800f9b6e5f812bf5dc77afe7a6de9f24accce9e84152d9f5ad5a","category":"Apple"}
