Notices will be sent to people who are eligible for payments, and links to claims forms are <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/lyft-uber-settlement\">available here</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980642#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980642&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da56f292ef0d9c887bb1a0826cecf4595833e6647d0d2dfb378ef194c66e312d","category":"Tech"}
