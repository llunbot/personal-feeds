The cause was not an unwelcome visit from the ghost of mechanical timepieces past but the International Trade Commission, which found that the California-based computer maker had infringed on some patents, resulting in the ITC banning the import of said watches. Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-administration-allows-us-trade-tribunals-ban-apple-watch-imports-2023-12-26/\">Reuters reported</a> that Apple filed an emergency request for the courts to lift the ban and will appeal the ITC ruling.</p>\n<p>And today, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-wins-bid-pause-apple-watch-ban-us-appeals-court-2023-12-27/\">granted Apple's wish</a>, pausing the ban while it considers the tech company's argument.</p>\n<p>Apple's watch problems started back in January. That's when a court found that the light-based pulse oximetry sensor (found on the back of the watches) infringed patents held by Masimo, a medical device manufacturer also based in California.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992857#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992857&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
