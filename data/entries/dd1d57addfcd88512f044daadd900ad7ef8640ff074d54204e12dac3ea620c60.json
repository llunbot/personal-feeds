When it comes to going fast, on the flat or downhill at least, aerodynamic drag has the biggest influence.</p>\n<p>Representing the leading edge of road-bike technology, the best aero road bikes challenge traditional notions of what makes a fast race bike.</p>\n<p>The latest aero bikes combine wind-cheating profiles with next-level integration to make these machines as slippery as possible. Sure, they may not always be at the cutting-edge when it comes to weight, but if you think an 8kg road bike can’t be fast, think again.</p>\n<h2>Are aero road bikes worth it?</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aero bikes are commonplace in the pro peloton, where riders are chasing marginal gains and, of course, have access to the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour bikes</a> from their team sponsors.</p>\n<p>The angular, sculpted frames of aero bikes particularly come to the fore on long, flat stages and under the sprinters, where the lower drag of wind-cheating tube profiles can give them the extra turn of speed they need to clinch a victory.</p>\n<p>Teams and their bike sponsors will typically provide riders with the choice between an aero bike and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">lightweight climbing bike</a>, and some riders will swap between them depending on the terrain.</p>\n<p>Some riders now stick to their aero bikes regardless of terrain, riding them on more undulating and mountainous territory. This is particularly true for breakaway specialists, who spend a lot more time in the wind than other riders and seek out whatever advantage they can get.</p>\n<p>That said, one of the recent trends in bike design has been the combination of low weight and aerodynamics, and some brands offer just one machine to meet both requirements. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl7-review/\">Specialized S-Works SL7</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-dogma-f/\">Pinarello Dogma F</a> are just two examples of aero-influenced all-rounders.</p>\n<p>However, aero road bikes are the fastest option out there in the majority of circumstances and you don’t have to be a pro to benefit, especially if you’re a rider who places a lot of significance on riding fast. After all, for a lot of people, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/aero-bike-test-notes/\">riding fast is fun</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, there is a lot to consider when it comes to finding the best aero road bike for your needs, especially for everyday riding.</p>\n<p>For those of us who aren’t blessed to be WorldTour pros with a team of mechanics at hand, an aero bike still needs to be easy to live with. Do you need an engineering degree to maintain it? Do the deep-section wheels make it a handful on windy days? How does it perform on broken roads?</p>\n<p>We’ve answered all of those questions in pursuit of finding the best aero bikes money can buy.</p>\n<p>Read on for our pick of the best aero bikes, as tested by the BikeRadar team, and <a href=\"#buyers-guide\">read our full buyer’s guide at the end of the article</a> to help you find the right bike for you.</p>\n\n<h2>The best aero road bikes in 2023, as tested by BikeRadar</h2>\n<h3>Cannondale SystemSix Hi-Mod eTap AXS</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Cannondale SystemSix HI-MOD Red eTap AXS\" title=\"Cannondale SystemSix HI-MOD Red eTap AXS\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The world’s fastest bike has seen an update and can still happily claim its crown for speed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£10,500 / $12,500 as tested</li>\n<li>Still one of the fastest bikes in the world</li>\n<li>Nimble handling and a comfortable ride</li>\n</ul><p>This Cannondale SystemSix is an incredibly fast bike that left us feeling other brands are still playing catch-up with Cannondale when it comes to creating aero bikes.</p>\n<p>The Hi-Mod frameset is Cannondale’s stiffest carbon fibre, and despite the stiffness and aero tubing, we found this to be a remarkably comfortable bike to ride.</p>\n<p>This bike has a halo-spec with a SRAM eTap AXS groupset, 64mm-deep carbon wheels and Cannondale’s two-piece aero KNOT handlebar, which still allows for plenty of adjustment.</p>\n<p>The price is high, but when you compare it to other bikes of this spec it’s competitive, and there is always the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-systemsix-carbon-ultegra-review/\">Cannondale SystemSix Carbon Ultegra</a>.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-systemsix-hi-mod-etap-axs-review/\">Read our full Cannondale SystemSix Hi-Mod eTap AXS review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Canyon Aeroad CF SLX 7 Disc eTap</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Canyon Aeroad CF SLX 7 Disc eTap road bike\" title=\"Canyon Aeroad CF SLX 7 Disc eTap - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Aeroad is a superb ride that could convert doubters to an aero bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£4,949 / €4,999 / AU$7,399 as tested (CF SLX 8.0 Disc eTap $7,499 in US)</li>\n<li>Great spec with SRAM Rival eTap and a power meter</li>\n<li>Superb ride that’s fast but comfortable</li>\n</ul><p>The latest Canyon Aeroad is a superb ride: lightning-fast and efficient but still comfortable enough over broken surfaces, with a 28mm rear and 25mm front tyre helping smooth things out.</p>\n<p>The component list on this model includes <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM Rival eTap AXS</a> complete with (single-sided) power meter and 50mm-deep DT Swiss carbon wheels.</p>\n<p>Canyon’s clever three-piece bar makes width adjustment and travelling with the bike easier.

It’s also really sharp-handling, planted at speed and still firm enough to respond immediately to pedal input.</p>\n<p>The S5 isn’t a light bike though, at 8.2kg for a size 56cm, and there’s not much fore and aft saddle adjustability, although seatposts with different setback are available.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cervelo-s5-force-etap-axs-review/\">Read our full Cervélo S5 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Cervélo Soloist Ultegra Di2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cervélo Soloist road bike review\" title=\"Cervélo Soloist road bike review\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cervélo Soloist is an aero bike for riders who want a bit of everything.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£6,800 / $6,800 as tested</li>\n<li>Balance of speed and comfort, but some rivals are lighter</li>\n<li>A few spec concessions on this model</li>\n</ul><p>The Cervélo Soloist was the original aero bike, released in 2002, and the Canadian company has now <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-cervelo-soloist/\">resurrected the Soloist name 20 years later</a>.</p>\n<p>With the S5 pitched as Cervélo’s pro-level aero bike, the Soloist is aimed at speed-hungry amateurs, with a (slightly) more affordable price and all-round flavour. It’s claimed to be lighter than the S5 and more aerodynamic than the R5, and offers clearance for 34mm tyres.</p>\n<p>And the result on the road? The Cervélo Soloist Ultegra Di2 is a very comfortable and fast aero-optimised racer deserving of the Soloist name.

The idea is to trick the wind into following the drag-saving shape of a full aerofoil while saving weight and maintaining frame stiffness.</p>\n<p>Truncated shapes are particularly evident on the down tube and seat tube, but on dedicated aero bikes usually carry over to the head tube, fork blades, seatpost and the rest of the frame.</p>\n<p>The latest aero bikes are all about integration and it’s rare to see exposed cables at the front end of the bike. The trick for bike manufacturers is providing that integration without sacrificing fit or everyday usability – some brands do this better than others.</p>\n<p>Aero bikes will sometimes have more aggressive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">road bike geometry</a> than all-round race bikes – and certainly more aggressive than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes/\">endurance road bikes</a> or sportive bikes. That normally means a longer, lower position that allows the rider to hunker down over the bar, reducing frontal profile for less wind resistance.</p>\n<p>An aero bike arguably needs deep-section aero wheels to complete the deal. The best will come with them, but some makers fit more basic wheelsets (usually to keep the price down), expecting you to buy your own.</p>\n<h3>Aero bike vs road bike</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant TCR Advanced 2 and Merida Reacto 4000 road bikes\" title=\"Giant TCR Advanced 2 and Merida Reacto 4000 road bikes\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Giant TCR (left) was a radical bike when it was first released, but looks conservative next to the aero Merida Reacto (right).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Max Wilman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It looks as if the era of the specialist aero bike may be passing.

If you’re looking for more of an all-rounder with an aero edge, there are now plenty of options out there. Equally, if all-out speed is your thing, a dedicated aero bike will have that ace up its sleeve.</p>\n<h3>What is the fastest aero bike?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist in white top riding Cannondale SystemSix HI-MOD Red eTap AXS road bike\" title=\"Cannondale SystemSix HI-MOD Red eTap AXS 05\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cannondale claimed the SystemSix was the fastest bike in the world when it was released – but take manufacturer claims with a pinch of salt.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Almost every aero bike will be accompanied by some kind of claim about how the bike is faster than its predecessor or competitors. Aero gains are often quoted as seconds saved over 40km at 45kph or such, but do you regularly ride at that speed? The laws of physics mean that if your average speed is half that, you’ll reap an eighth of that figure.</p>\n<p>With around 80 per cent of wind resistance down to you, rather than the bike, there is only so much help an aero bike can provide. That’s before we get to the rider’s engine, too. If speed is your thing, here are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/go-faster-for-free/\">five ways you can ride faster for free</a>.</p>\n<p>Having said that, few riding experiences beat the feeling of free speed when riding fast on a sharp-handling aero bike, especially on a rapid downhill or full-gas on a flat or rolling road.</p>\n<p>As for the ‘fastest’ aero bike, as ever we’d tread with caution when it comes to manufacturer claims. Sure, you can factor it into your buying decision, but there’s lots more to consider besides, including fit, usability, frame features (for example, tyre clearance) and budget.</p>\n<h3>Tube shapes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wilier Triestina Cento10 hybrid road eBike\" title=\"Wilier Triestina Cento10 hybrid 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many aero road bikes have Kammtail tube shaping, like on this Wilier Cento10.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It goes without saying that an aero bike will have aero tube profiles. These are most obvious on the main tubes of the bike, the down tube and the seat tube in particular.</p>\n<p>Aero features will likely extend to the seatstays, which are often dropped, hitting the seat tube some way down from its top, as well as being aero in profile. The head tube, fork and seatpost (and its clamp) are also likely to have had the aero treatment.</p>\n<p>The first crop of aero road bikes, led by the Cervélo Soloist (which has now made a comeback in 2022), had teardrop-shaped tubes. It’s the classic aerodynamic shape, but the tail adds a lot of weight without much structural benefit, so the frames tended to be heavy. The extended profile could also make for tricky handling in crosswinds.</p>\n<p>That’s changed now, with the realisation that a truncated aerofoil (or Kammtail) can be more aerodynamically efficient than a teardrop.</p>\n<p>Air forms an eddy behind the cut-off edge of the tube and air flowing past this forms a teardrop shape that’s much longer than the tube. Trek says that although the length of its Kammtail tubing is less than three times its width, it behaves aerodynamically as if it’s eight times the width.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, there’s potentially a quadruple benefit from truncated aerofoils: they use less material for a lighter frame, they are more structurally rigid, they produce longer virtual tails to the tubes and they’re less edgy in crosswinds.</p>\n<p>Another plus: they make it much easier for manufacturers to produce aero designs that comply with the geometry rules set by the UCI, cycling’s world governing body.</p>\n<h3>Integration</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon CP0018 Aerocockpit\" title=\"20200929_SB_5DSR_MG_3267\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Not a cable in sight. The CP0018 Aerocockpit on Canyon’s Aeroad is a prime example of front-end integration.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The new frontier in aero bike design is front-end integration. That means the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">handlebar</a> and stem are often one piece, with a broad, flat aero shape to the bar. At least some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-brake-gear-cables-explained/\">brake and gear cables</a> will run internally into the frame, so they’re out of the airflow.</p>\n<p>There’s a surprising amount of drag from round cables routed externally. Pinarello claimed burying the cables inside the bar and stem of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/pinarello-dogma-f12-dura-ace-di2-disc-review/\">Dogma F12</a> improved aerodynamics by more than 5 per cent relative to its F10 predecessor, which had external cabling (Pinarello has since launched the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-dogma-f/\">Dogma F</a>).</p>\n<p>The flip side is that some integrated systems can be difficult to work with, so expect to spend more on maintenance or to deal with more frustration if doing it yourself.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure you’re comfortable with the position dictated by a bike’s integrated carbon bar/stem. There are limited size options and adjustability to many integrated systems.</p>\n<p>The best integrated cockpits keep everything clean and tidy, hiding the cables from the wind, but still allow for easy servicing and fit adjustments, most likely by keeping the handlebar and stem as two separate units.</p>\n<h3>Ride quality</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Madone SLR aero road bike isoflow side\" title=\"DSC00049\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest Trek Madone SLR uses IsoFlow technology to improve comfort (and boost aero performance).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With their chunky tube profiles, aero bikes of old had a (often justified) reputation for a harsh ride.</p>\n<p>That’s largely changed with the modern crop of aero bikes, because brands have learned how to design frames for a more comfortable ride without compromising aerodynamics, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a> have increased tyre clearances – you can now run a 28mm or even 30mm tyre on many of the latest aero bikes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it’s something to look out for if you’re thinking of buying an aero bike. It’s worth reading <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/\">road bike reviews</a> and, ideally, taking a test ride before parting with your cash, especially if you live somewhere with rough roads.</p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Lapierre Aircode DRS 8.0 road bike\" title=\"Lapierre Aircode DRS 8.0 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long and low is the aim of the aero bike geometry game, with many bikes even looking fast.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As mentioned above, an aero bike will typically promote a long, low ride position. That’s great for cutting through the wind, but make sure you’ll be comfortable riding an aero bike (or that it offers the adjustability you need) before taking the plunge. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-fix-5-of-the-most-common-causes-of-bike-pain/\">Neck, back, shoulder and hand pain</a> can be issues if you’re not very flexible or not used to an aggressive position.</p>\n<p>You may adapt to the position, but if you’re not racing you don’t want to end up suffering on your bike to go a little faster – being forced to cut your ride short due to pain or picking up an injury is counter-productive, to say the least.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Felt AR Ultegra Di2\" title=\"Felt AR Ultegra Di2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aero bikes can still climb. The weight and performance difference between many conventional road bikes and aero bikes is slim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Weight used to be a driving factor behind bike design, with a lower weight perceived to result in a faster and better ride. Aero bikes disprove the rule, with many tipping the scale at around 8kg and feeling lightning-quick.</p>\n<p>While a lightweight bike might serve you better on long climbs, the weight and performance difference between many more conventional bikes and aero bikes is marginal, and improving your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-to-weight-ratio/\">power-to-weight ratio</a> can be one way to offset the difference.</p>\n<p>There are also <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/8-ways-to-make-your-road-bike-lighter/\">ways to make your road bike lighter</a> if you’re that way inclined.</p>\n<p>A lightweight bike might feel more responsive, but geometry and tyre choice arguably have as much impact on the feel of a bike as weight. If you want something that feels responsive and snappy, look for a bike with a short wheelbase and a head tube angle of around 73.5 degrees.</p>\n<h3>Wheels</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale Systemsix Carbon Ultegra 04\" title=\"Cannondale Systemsix Carbon Ultegra 04\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aero bikes ideally need deep-section wheels to make the most of the aerodynamic frames.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>An aero bike needs an aero wheelset to complement – and make the most of – the frame’s aerodynamics. It’s still all too common to find an aero frameset equipped with budget, non-aero wheels. Recognising this, some brands are now fitting wheels worthy of the investment they’ve made in their frames.</p>\n<p>Unless you’ve got a set of go-fast wheels already sitting at home, it’s worth looking for a bike that comes with decent deep-section wheels. If not, and you do want to upgrade, budget the best part of £1,000 for a set of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">best road bike wheels</a>.</p>\n<h3>Brakes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano’s Ultegra brakes on the Wilier Triestina Cento10 SL Ultegra Di2 use Ice-Tech rotors\" title=\"Wilier Triestina Cento10 SL Ultegra Di2 06\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes are pretty much standard on the latest high-end aero bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Disc brakes have largely taken over on all new bikes, but rim-brake outliers are still out there, particularly if you’re <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-buy-a-used-or-second-hand-bike-online/\">buying a second-hand bike</a>.</p>\n<p>If you go for a rim-brake aero bike (and, most likely, an older model), you may find the calipers have been moved out of the wind. The front brake may be integrated into the fork and the rear brake may be under the bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this is less common nowadays and, as a general rule, we’d steer riders away from integrated brakes. Integrated front brakes are often less effective than a separate caliper, and rear brakes under the bottom bracket are prone to brake rub and getting covered in filth.</p>\n<p>Most high-end aero bikes now come with disc brakes, but it’s worth bearing in mind if you’re looking at a lower-priced rim-brake model.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"dd1d57addfcd88512f044daadd900ad7ef8640ff074d54204e12dac3ea620c60","category":"Cycling"}
