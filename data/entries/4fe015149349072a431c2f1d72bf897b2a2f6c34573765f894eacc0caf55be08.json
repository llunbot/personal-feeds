But none were so bold and weird as 1995's Virtual Boy, a \"woefully premature commercial curio,\" as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/what-happened-to-the-virtual-reality-gaming-revolution/\">one Ars writer put it</a>, that \"quickly passed unlamented into history,\" as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/how-i-launched-3-consoles-and-found-true-love-at-babbages-store-no-9/3/\">remarked another</a>. The awkward red-on-black tabletop headset system wasn't so much ahead of its time as beamed in from an alternate reality. In this reality, it didn't sell much and was largely forgotten.</p>\n<p>Nintendo has seemed eager to let the Virtual Boy fade from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/virtual-boy-owners-club.940863/\">the collective memory</a>, but clever coders have labored to keep the system accessible outside vintage hardware collections. The latest, and perhaps most accessible, is <a href=\"https://github.com/skyfloogle/red-viper\">Red Viper</a>, which plays Virtual Boy games on a (<a href=\"https://3ds.hacks.guide/\">lightly hacked</a>) Nintendo 3DS, the other Nintendo system on which 3D features were underappreciated. It is full-speed, it supports homebrew games, you can change the drawing color to something other than red, and it is free. It's built on top of the work of earlier 3DS emulator <a href=\"https://github.com/mrdanielps/r3Ddragon\">r3dragon</a>, which itself drew heavily from the <a href=\"http://www.goliathindustries.com/vb/VBDown.html\">Reality Boy project for Windows</a>.</p>\n<div><blockquote><p>Just released Red Viper, a Virtual Boy emulator that runs on the Nintendo 3DS. All official games run at full speed! <a href=\"https://t.co/YSP3f7Yd0X\">https://t.co/YSP3f7Yd0X</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YiNh6sG74Y\">pic.twitter.com/YiNh6sG74Y</a></p>— Floogle (@Skyfloogle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfloogle/status/1761806433165734157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div>\n<p>Red Viper makes use of the 3DS's top screen for game display and turns the lower screen into a system options panel. It maps the Virtual Boy's own face buttons onto the touchscreen. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skyfloogle/status/1761806433165734157?s=46\">the Twitter thread</a> announcing Red Viper's general release, coder Floogle notes that the emulator is only roughly translating the Virtual Boy's 50 Hz refresh to the 3DS' 60 Hz by pushing a frame every 20 ms. There is, Floogle supposes, some hardware headroom for improvement.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006111#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006111&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4fe015149349072a431c2f1d72bf897b2a2f6c34573765f894eacc0caf55be08","category":"Tech"}
