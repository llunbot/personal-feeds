While the bulk of the new emoji simply adds new skin tones to existing designs, there will also be nine brand-new characters to choose from     :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Distorted face</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cartoon fight cloud</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ballet dancer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple core</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Orca (killer whale)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bigfoot</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trombone</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Landslide</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Treasure chest</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note, the distorted face emoji looks very much like the crushed face emoji from <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2328855/ipad-ad-harmless-fun.html\">Apple’s since-pulled ad</a> for the M4 iPad Pro. Apple faced a torrent of criticism over the ad, which showed numerous creative instruments being crushed in a hydraulic press. The lasting image was an emoji stress ball with its eyes popping out as it was being crushed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually releases the new emoji in one of the mid-cycle updates. For example, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218208/ios-17-4-alternative-app-stores-emoji-fixes-security-updates-install.html\">iOS 17.4</a> in March introduced several new emoji, including a lime, phoenix, and shaking heads and it’s expected that the next round will arrive in one of the spring iOS 18 updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the list is expected to be approved by September 2025, it’s unlikely that the new emoji will arrive in the first release of iOS 19. Apple needs time to design the emoji in their own style, so expect to see them in 2026, likely in iOS 19.4 or 19.5. But Apple Intelligence’s Genmoji feature, which lets you create personalized AI emoji with simple text prompts, is coming next month in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-install-release-beta.html\">iOS 18.2</a>, so if you really want a trombone emoji you’ll be able to create one soon enough.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b3940c4119b2c023d8078613e4a65258c5f30edb4479ae1ab82098fe0b8ed35b","category":"Apple"}
