Apple used a quantum dot film instead of a red KSF phosphor film, a change that provides more vibrant, accurate color results.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-MacBook-Pros-Thumb.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nYoung says that Apple has opted for KSF for prior <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> models because it doesn't use toxic element cadmium (typical for quantum dot) and is more efficient (and thus less expensive). Way back in 2015, when Apple introduced support for P3 wide color on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, Apple executives said that <a href=\"https://medium.com/backchannel/exclusive-why-apple-is-still-sweating-the-details-on-imac-531a95e50c91\">quantum dot technology had been considered</a> for its LED displays, but rejected because of the cadmium requirement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Big Apple display news, they have adopted quantum dots for the first time. The latest MacBook Pro's (M4) use a quantum dot (QD) film rather than a red KSF phosphor film. <br /><br />In the past, Apple went with the KSF solution due to better efficiency and lack of cadmium (Cd), but the… <a href=\"https://t.co/5olq9lEHs9\">pic.twitter.com/5olq9lEHs9</a></p>— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1857208745014776215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nThere are now cadmium-free quantum dot options that Young says have as good or better color gamut and better motion performance than the KSF film Apple previously used. The KSF phosphor coating Apple added to prior ‌MacBook Pro‌ models boosted color by enhancing shades of red, but quantum dot film is considered superior because it often results in better color accuracy and a wider color gamut.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nQuantum dot technology has been used for high-end displays for several years, with companies like Samsung and Sony manufacturing \"QLED\" displays and TV sets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple didn't highlight specific color improvements with the ‌M4 MacBook Pro‌ models, but max SDR brightness increased to 1,000 nits, up from 600 nits in the prior model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/m4-macbook-pro-quantum-dot/\">M4 MacBook Pro Uses Quantum Dot Display Technology</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macbook-pro-uses-quantum-dot-display-technology.2443019/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"510e1dbe4f4ad6d5b76f1aaa7613c4369065b5ded7791e15abba63ddf472aaff","category":"Apple"}
