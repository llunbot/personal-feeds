This change was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/19/ifixit-iphone-14-teardown/\">first made to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a> last year, and now it extends to the Pro models this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAt the time, we said that the removable back glass would likely result in significantly lower repair fees for iPhone 15 Pro models with cracked back glass for customers without AppleCare+ coverage, and this is now confirmed. As noted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianzelbo/status/1703439723400667246\">by Ian Zelbo</a>, Apple has <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair\">updated its U.S. website</a> with iPhone 15 repair fees, revealing that it will charge $169 or $199 to repair the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max with back glass damage. By comparison, these fees are set at $499 or $549 for the iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lower fees were also reported <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/17/replacing-back-glass-iphone-15-pro/\">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>. For customers with AppleCare+ coverage for their iPhone, back glass damage can be repaired for $29.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the U.S., Apple's battery replacement fee is set at $99 for all four iPhone 15 models, which is unchanged from the iPhone 14 series.
