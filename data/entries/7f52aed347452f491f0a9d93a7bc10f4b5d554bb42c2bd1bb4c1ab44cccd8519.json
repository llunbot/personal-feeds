Scott says its testing revealed a shorter seat tube produced a two-watt efficiency saving when a rider was on the bike, despite a longer seat tube being more aerodynamic without a rider.</p>\n<p>The finished product is typical of modern <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time trial bikes</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-pinarello-bolide-time-trial-bike-spotted/\">Pinarello Bolide</a>, although it also bears a strong resemblance to the brand’s latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bike</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2023-scott-foil-rc-pro/\">Scott Foil RC.</a></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A modular version of the bike was tested in the wind tunnel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott</i></span></div>\n<p>Deep truncated aerofoil tubes are paired with dropped seatstays and an aero seatpost. However, the narrowness of the Scott Plasma RC TT’s head tube stands out (more on this later).</p>\n<p>Besides being more aerodynamic, the brand claims the new Plasma RC TT frameset is 12 per cent lighter than the previous version.</p>\n<p>Scott claims the Plasma RC TT is 33 seconds quicker over a 40km time trial compared to the previous version, when ridden at an identical power output.</p>\n<p>Scott says that figure was calculated using real-world testing, rather than just race simulations.</p>\n<h2>More stable geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Scott says geometry tweaks make the steering less twitchy at speed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Auld </i></span></div>\n<p>Scott says it shortened the RC Plasma TT’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pushing-the-limits-of-fork-offset-an-experiment/\">fork offset </a>and increased the trail by 5.2mm in order to slow the steering and make the bike more stable at speed.</p>\n<p>Although this <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained\">geometry</a> change doesn’t deliver immediate benefit in the wind tunnel, Scott claims a rider can stay in their most aerodynamic position for longer on a more stable bike.</p>\n<h2>Greater integration</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The slim head tube is said to reduce frontal area and therefore drag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Eltoromedia.com</i></span></div>\n<p>As we noticed last year, the Scott Plasma RC TT has a very slim head tube.</p>\n<p>The brand says its patented slotted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/\">headset </a>design allows cables to run directly through the headset.</p>\n<p>This removes the need for clearance for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-brake-gear-cables-explained/\">cables</a> to pass around the steerer and allows the use of a smaller upper bearing, according to Scott.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the head tube can be narrower than previously possible, which Scott claims reduces drag as it lowers the bike’s frontal area.</p>\n<p>The brand says this design also makes it easier to dismantle the fork and cockpit, for example when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-fly-with-your-bike/\">flying with your bike</a>, because the cables do not need to be disconnected.</p>\n<h2>Customisable cockpit</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Scott says it designed the cockpit to fit all Team DSM riders.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Eltoromedia.com</i></span></div>\n<p>Scott says it analysed bike fit measurements from the Team DSM men’s, women’s and junior teams to create “the most adjustable integrated time trial cockpit on the market”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The extensions can be adjusted laterally by five degrees.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Syncros Creston IC TT system has adjustable and interchangeable parts that enable riders to finely tune the width, height, length and angle.</p>\n<p>According to Scott, this enables all riders to find their most aerodynamic, physiologically efficient and comfortable position within the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/2023-uci-rule-changes/\">latest UCI technical regulations</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, the stem comes in three different sizes (85, 105 and 125mm).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Time trial positions have risen higher recently.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Eltoromedia.com</i></span></div>\n<p>The stack height of the armrests can be raised by up to 145mm to suit different degrees of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/it-band-injuries-and-cycling-what-you-need-to-know/\">hip flexibility</a> and a rider’s individual <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/how-to-nail-your-time-trial-position-like-tony-martin/\">time trial positions</a>.</p>\n<p>The vertical angle of the extensions can be adjusted from horizontal up to 15 degrees, while the grip angle is adjustable from 13 to 53 degrees to find the perfect hand position.</p>\n<p>The position of the arm pads can also be adjusted for comfort.
