Over the years, however, cross-country has changed, and with it, the demands of the machine. The updated Rocky Mountain Element is well suited for whatever comes racing its way. Whether skin suits, baggies, racing, or exploration, the new Rocky Mountain Element is lighter, faster, and ready to rip.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Camping and riding RM Element\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Web_Element_MRiga_Product_ChilcotinBC_MRP6276-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos: Rocky Mountain) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is it – Rocky Mountain Element </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Element is Rocky Mountains cross-country ripper. It’s the most spandex of the Rocky lineup (minus the Solo Gravel), and its ethos is speed, agility, and versatility. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Riding on the range with the Element \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-riding--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, the Element is a cross-country race bike, but with 130mm of front and 120mm of rear travel, it’s slowly creeping up the down-country category. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest iteration picks up where the previous one left off. It boasts a lighter frame, updated suspension kinematics, and size-specific tuning. The Rocky Mountain design team added unique gear-carrying solutions and extra water bottle capacity to the Element, giving it a longer leash for adventure and all-day exploration. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rocky Mountain Element C70 green and yellow \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C70-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s New? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable parts of the new Element are the suspension and frame. The updated Element uses Rocky Mountain Smoothlink SL Flex Pivot suspension. It ushers in a new flex stay design that Rocky Mountain calls the Smoothlink SL flex stay. Some other mountain bike manufacturers have successfully used this design, and it’s cool to see Rocky’s twist on the idea.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RM-Element-flex-stay-.png\"><img width=\"2046\" height=\"1346\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RM-Element-flex-stay-.png\" alt=\"RM Element flex stay\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RM-Element-flex-stay-.png 2046w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RM-Element-flex-stay--297x195.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RM-Element-flex-stay--1536x1010.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RM-Element-flex-stay--120x79.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RM-Element-flex-stay--768x505.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Smoothlink SL Flex Stay helps the team eliminate the traditional pivot, shaving a decent amount of weight from the frame. It also stiffens the rear triangle. The team has also upgraded dual-row, high-capacity bearings at the seat stay junction for increased service life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rocky Mountain Element C70 rear shock \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-shock--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocky Mountain says the new flex stay design <em>“optimizes the flex to behave like our four-bar Smoothlink suspension designs. Our suspension philosophy balances efficiency, comfort, and traction to achieve the legendary Rocky Mountain ride feel.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage-.png\"><img width=\"2068\" height=\"1344\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage-.png\" alt=\"Camping and riding RM Element Tube storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage-.png 2068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage--297x193.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage--1536x998.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage--120x78.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage--768x499.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Camping-and-riding-RM-Element-Tube-storage--2048x1331.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rocky Mountain Element Frame Details </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the SmoothLink SL, the Element frame has undergone some changes. First, it’s lighter than ever before. Now arriving with an updated carbon layup (combined with the Flex Stay suspension), the new frame is over 350g lighter than the previous model. The Rocky Mountain team says the weight drop and Flex Stay don’t compromise stiffness. Even though it’s much slimmer than the previous version. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rocky Mountain Element C99 frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-Frameset-white--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame update also includes some practical additions besides losing some weight. The updated Element frames feature an accessory mount underneath the top tube, forward of the shock. This gives riders more options for bringing what’s needed for everything from racing to deep backcountry missions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rocky Mountain Element C99 SID Luxe Shock \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-FA-shock-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame also arrives with the Rocky Mountain Ride-4™ Adjustment System.

Most sizes (except XS and SM) feature two lower bottle mounts capable of carrying full-sized water bottles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Here is the water bottle breakdown per frame size. </em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>XS = 1x 650ml bottle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SM = 650ml + x Fidlock 450ml bottles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MD – XL = 2x 770ml bottles</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rocky Mountain Element C99 Full bike with XX AXS and FA \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-C99-Full--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Size Specific Tuning </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Element follows a Rocky Mountain’s size-specific tuning program. The suspension tune ensures that riders of all sizes get the right balance of small-bump compliance, mid-stroke support, and end-stroke progressiveness. Based on real-world field testing, custom shock tunes are adjusted for each frame size.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Element is my go-to bike, and I can’t stop riding it. It’s light and snappy on the trail and loves to be flicked through the corners. It’s playful and poppy, making smooth trails fun, yet still able to hit well above its weight class regarding technical trails. The flex stays make the bike simpler, lighter, stiffer, and more responsive. The engineers knocked this one out of the park. It makes me want to explore further and is my bike of choice for 90% of my riding.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– Sam Schultz, Rocky Mountain Athlete</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rocky Mountain Element Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-geo-.png\"><img width=\"1684\" height=\"1038\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-geo-.png\" alt=\"Rocky Mountain Element geometry chart \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-geo-.png 1684w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-geo--297x183.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-geo--1536x947.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-geo--120x74.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rocky-Mountain-Element-geo--768x473.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rocky Mountain Element geometry has stayed the same.
