Both have the same stack heights as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/look-keo-blade-pedals-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Look’s uninstrumented pedals</a>. Look says they provide the lowest stack heights available for pedal power meters, as well as the lowest weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are single-sided and dual-sided power measurement options for both power meters and Look claims +/-1 per cent power accuracy, which it says is independent of temperature and altitude changes. Look also claims easy installation and simple operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UK prices for dual-sided power measurement are £899.99 for the Keo Power and £999.99 for the X-Track Power, with single-sided power measurement £599.99 and £679.99 respectively. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/look-keo-blade-pedals-2024\">Fourth gen Look Keo Blade pedals are more aero, more durable and easier to use</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/look-795-blade-rs-review\">Look 795 Blade RS review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">Best road bike pedals 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/how-to-choose-a-power-meter\">How to choose a power meter</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Low weight and stack height</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/LOOK_ROAD_23_%C2%A9www.jeremy-bernard.com-31-sur-64-970x647.jpg\" /><figcaption>www.jeremy-bernard.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look’s claimed weight of 260g per pair for the Keo Power pedals compares with a claimed 326g for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-rally-power-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin Rally</a> RK200 dual-sided, 303g for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/favero-assioma-duo-shi-power-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">Favero Assioma </a>and 276g for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wahoo-powrlink-zero-pedals-kickr-rollr-trainer\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Powrlink Zero</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look’s nearest competitor in off-road power meter pedals is the Garmin Rally XC200, with a claimed weight of 444g, as against the Look Power’s 405g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most pedal <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">power meters</a>, including the Wahoo Powrlink Zero and Garmin Rally, add a little extra stack height over standard pedals, Look has managed to fit all its electronics and a rechargeable battery into a standard-diameter spindle and standard format pedal body, so there’s no difference in stack height from its non-instrumented pedals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows you to swap between power meter pedals and standard pedals without needing to worry about micro-adjusting your saddle height. A lower pedal-plus-cleat stack height also, in theory, improved pedalling efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Keo Power pedals have the same updated profile as the recent upgrade to the non-instrumented <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/look-keo-blade-pedals-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Keo Blade pedals</a>, which Look says provides aero benefits over its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/look-keo-blade-carbon-ceramic-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">previous generation </a>Keo Blade pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is now standard with almost all cycling peripherals, from power meters to<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\"> turbo trainers</a> to heart rate monitors, there’s both BLE and ANT+ compatibility. Data transmitted by Look’s power meter includes power, cadence and, for the dual-sided power meter, left/right balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedal spindle houses all the electronics for the Power pedals. It’s made of military-grade hardened stainless steel for ruggedness, with the antenna that transmits power data to your head unit housed under a polycarbonate end cap. The pedals are designed to be shock resistant and they are IPX7 waterproof.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Easier setup</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/LOOK_GRAVEL_23_%C2%A9www.jeremy-bernard.com-3-sur-53-970x647.jpg\" /><figcaption>www.jeremy-bernard.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look’s previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/looksrm-exakt-power-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">Exakt </a>power meter was developed in partnership with power meter expert SRM and Look had a prior power meter partnership with Polar, but the new Power pedals are an in-house development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Exakt pedals required fiddly setup, but the new Look Power pedals are designed to be plug-and-play using Look’s proprietary automatic calibration algorithm. Look says they’ll give you reasonable accurate power readings even if they’re finger tightened and good accuracy from 15Nm, although it recommends torquing to 35Nm for the most accurate readings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installation requires a 15mm pedal spanner, as Look has positioned the charge port in the inboard end of the pedal spindle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery life from the rechargeable battery is claimed at 60 hours, with a two hour full recharge time. The batteries are recharged using a magnetic clip connector with a double-headed USB-C cable allowing simultaneous recharging of both pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Look Power pedals are accompanied by a phone app, available for iOS and Android, which assists with pedal calibration and tracking pedal parameters. It also supports warranty registration, provides an installation guide and offers access to technical support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s data on battery level and firmware updates via the app. You can access stats on normalised power, intensity factor, power zones, training stress score, functional threshold power, pedalling smoothness and torque effectiveness in the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Look sells its non-instrumented pedals, including the Keo Blade and the X-Track, in extra-light formats with a titanium axle, the Look Power pedals are only available with a steel axle due to the need to preserve their strength while leaving space to fit the power meter electronics within the spindle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look offers a three year warranty and crash replacement on the Power pedals, which are assembled in its factory in Nevers, France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The off-road pedals are already in use with the Rockrider pro team, while Look expects to take over from SRM as the power meter provider to Cofidis later this year and says that the team is already using the Keo Power in training. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Look Power pedal specs and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Look Power road pedal
