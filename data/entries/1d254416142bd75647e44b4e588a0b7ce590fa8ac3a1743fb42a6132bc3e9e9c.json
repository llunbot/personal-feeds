Brett reckons his Hightower was the perfect bike for The Merida Ex Enduro…</span></figcaption><span> <i>THE MERIDA EX ENDURO / Jon Woodhouse</i></span></div>\n<p>You can’t go to any event in the UK without seeing a flock of Santa Cruz bikes, so Brett’s Hightower had to be included (even if it did mess up my theme of bikes based around the letter ‘M’. A Murmur, a mullet, a Merida, a Marin… I hope you noticed!).</p>\n<p>While you can find Santa Cruz bikes with longer travel, Brett reckons his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/santa-cruz-hightower-cc-x01-reserve-review/\">Hightower</a> is the perfect UK one-bike-to-do-it-all – good enough on the pedals to get him up hills and across lots of ground, and enough travel at the back (145mm) to get down UK trails at warp speed.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/Brett-accessories-ec7b791.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Are you even enduro if you don’t strap pumps, tools and bottles to your bike?
