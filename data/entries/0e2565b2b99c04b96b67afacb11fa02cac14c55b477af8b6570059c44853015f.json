{"title":"Top Fives Along the Great Divide Route: Bike Touring Distilled – Mitchell Connell","link":"https://theradavist.com/bikepacking-great-divide-route-top-fives-questions/","date":1684062010000,"content":"<p><em>As riders prepare for the 2023 Tour Divide Grand Depart, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jmitchellconnell/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Mitchell Connell</a> reflects on his time riding a section of the Divide with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/baker.bklyn/\" target=\"_blank\">Baker Donahue</a> and Will Reynolds, who were headed north from Antelope Wells, NM to Banff, Alberta.

Sometime last year, I was leafing through an issue from my friend’s coffee table when I came across an article on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gaptoothbimbo/\" target=\"_blank\">Breana Geering</a>. The author asked her to list her top five answers to a variety of questions (top five things to worry about, pieces of advice you’d give to the 13-year-old you, etc.) and it stuck with me.</p>\n<p>A year or so later, I was thinking about that article while riding along Grassy Lake Road on the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. I was trying to keep up with Baker Donahue and Will Reynolds, who were both in better shape than I was. While that’s not unusual (both Will and Baker are typically super fit), it was particularly remarkable on this day because I’d started my ride in Jackson, Wyoming, some 40 miles earlier, and they both started in Antelope Wells, New Mexico and had covered about 1,700 miles before meeting up with me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-03.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“Top five albums to descend to?”</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sunami/Gulch Split</em>, Sunami</li>\n<li><em>Come Away with ESG</em>, ESG</li>\n<li>That new Maggie Rogers single on repeat</li>\n<li><em>Afrique Victime</em>, Mdou Moctar</li>\n<li><em>IV</em>, Led Zeppelin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route probably needs no introduction, but for those who are unfamiliar, it’s a 2,700-mile mostly-dirt route that travels along the Continental Divide from Banff, Canada to the border between Mexico and the U.S. Traditionally, the route is ridden north to south, but for a variety of reasons Will and Baker decided to ride the route backward.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-09.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“Top five reasons to ride northbound?”</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get to see all the racers heading south</li>\n<li>You get to finish in Banff</li>\n<li>The weather is better in New Mexico earlier in the season</li>\n<li>You can avoid most of the snow in the north</li>\n<li>The riding is less technical at the beginning, so you’re less likely to get worked early on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we rode along Grassy Lake Road, a few racers gave us a wave as they passed by.

The landscape transitioned into wide open basins with big fields of flowers and bigger fields of cattle.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“Top five reasons to stop riding for a minute?”</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Potential bike friends</li>\n<li>Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwiches</li>\n<li>Session-able feature (jump, skinny, etc)</li>\n<li>Good potential photo spot</li>\n<li>Any semblance of shade in New Mexico</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We rolled into a small mountain town as the more severe weather began to hit.

The weather along the continental divide is unpredictable, but to have the daily high temperature go from 91 to 45 overnight surprised me. The shelter of the trees in the morning quickly gave way to expansive basins and heavy headwinds. The rain began again and turned to hail.</p>\n<p>The attitude of the racers changed noticeably as the weather worsened. During our first two days of warm weather, each racer would ride by with a smile and a wave, often tucked in an aero position. On our third and fourth days with chilly temperatures and a mix of rain and hail, nearly every racer stopped to chat for a bit. I think everyone was looking for an excuse to stop for a few minutes. Each time the conversation ended, we headed north with a little more knowledge of the route ahead.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/TopFivesAndTGD-24.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“Top five things sent home?”</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finished book (<em>Dawn of Everything</em>)</li>\n<li>Adjustable wrench</li>\n<li>Crocs</li>\n<li>Puffy jacket after Colorado</li>\n<li>Lock</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After half a day of riding on my last day, I started looking for cell phone service.

We hit it off and chatted for the hour-and-a-half drive back to Idaho Falls.

When I was in college, I rode the GDMBR with my brother, Spencer, and my friends, Robert and Lane. I still can’t believe how many little details I remembered.
