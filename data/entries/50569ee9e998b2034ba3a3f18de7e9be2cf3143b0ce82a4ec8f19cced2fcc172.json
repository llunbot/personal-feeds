With the Trek Project One programme, you can set about building a machine that stands out from the pack in as subtle or as bold a way as you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customisation options range from simple paint colours and designs to a full custom paintjob, handpicked groupset components, wheels and finishing kit. Yes, starting your New Year with a one-of-a-kind machine beneath you could be the perfect way to kick-start your cycling ambitions for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trust the process</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You won’t be alone on your journey to self-expression; Trek’s master designers and mechanics will be right there with you. The first step is choosing which of Trek’s base models to use as the template to build your creation around – race, aero, comfort or gravel, it’s your choice. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bringing your new ride to life at Trek’s US HQ in Wisconsin, the company’s in-house design team offers a seemingly endless palette of colours and logo designs to help bring your own vision to life. And once you’ve finally decided on a paint scheme, it’s time to customise the parts so Trek’s master builders can assemble your dream creation for you. From that point, you could have your unique bike in your hands in as little as 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride the rainbow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to customisation, there are no wrong choices – and boy, does Trek offer choices. Yes, you can simply choose a colour from Trek’s standard options (£750) or select from a curated selection of pre-designed ‘Icon’ frames (£1,650), imbued with depth, mood and texture by Trek’s own artists.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-3-776x970.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-3-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-3-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-3-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-3-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-3-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For the ultimate in personalisation, there’s Project One Ultimate (£POA), where a Trek designer will work with you one-to-one to bring your own unique creation to life and the design parameters are limited only by your imagination.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Perfect your parts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve decided on your choice of colours, it’s time to customise the moving parts. After choosing your desired base model, where components are concerned, the options are plentiful. Choices range from a simple bottom bracket or stem swap to a full groupset or wheelset change, allowing you to configure the lightest or fastest bike possible, or simply one that fits you better than a stock build.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-4-776x970.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-4-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-4-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-4-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-4-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-4-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/trek-project-one-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Improve on perfection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter what you ride or where you ride it – Trek Project One options are available on some of the best bikes in the world.
