I don’t mean that you should start halfway up, but rather that you should start some way from the base of the climb near Selva di Cadore. Give yourself a run at it. Warm the legs, open up the lungs. Don’t do what I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, for most of the climbs in this series, logistics mean that I simply set off at the base. <i>Bang</i> – straight into the gradient. Almost like an intimidating first date: no preamble, no drink at the bar, just, ‘How many children do you envisage having and what’s your salary?’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-cime-de-la-bonette\">Classic climbs: Cime de la Bonette</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 140: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2023: Everything you need to know including route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>On climbs such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-no-1-tre-cime-di-lavaredo\" target=\"_blank\">Tre Cime di Laveredo</a>, this approach can make things uncomfortable at first, but then the gradient will ease a little to let you recover and regroup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, blissfully, the climb will even have a mild incline at the outset, perhaps wending a way through some meadows, such as on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-tour-de-france-climbs-col-d-izoard\" target=\"_blank\">Col d’Izoard</a>. This allows a chance to spin freely before the hard work begins, and if you’re lucky you even get some shade to shield you from the sun’s glare as you ascend.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Giau classic climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The very start of the climb, with the Codalonga river tumbling down in the foreground and the peak of the Averau in the distance.</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>None of this applies to the Giau. Unrelenting is probably the best description of this 9.5km climb in the Dolomites. And that’s not unrelenting at a manageable 6% or 7%, but rather unrelenting between 9% and 10%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, there is a very brief dip to just below 8%, but that’s not really a rest – it’s more a case of finding a slightly smoother piece of wall to bang your head against. But there’s a reason the harder southern side of the Giau is the more famous: its setting is just so distractingly beautiful.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Giau classic climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>There are two short avalanche tunnels either side of a hairpin early in the climb, followed by a much longer stretch of shade about two thirds of the way up</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The turning off the SP251 onto the SP638 feels like the natural start to the climb, and instantly it’s picture-postcard stuff. The Codalonga river runs next to and sometimes underneath the road as you begin the ascent. It’s not just a measly trickle, either – it has stunning miniature waterfalls along its course that make the water foam as it tumbles downwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tall pine trees populate this lower landscape too, but not so densely as to obscure all views. In fact on a clear day you can see the distant peak of the Averau, a huge, pale loaf of rock standing proudly against the blue sky like a lone tooth in a mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Climb by numbers</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Passo Giau classic climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/passo-giau-classic-climb-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Hairpin number 11 of 29, and you still don’t really feel as if you’re getting anywhere.</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The climb’s 29 corners are numbered, which is depressing or encouraging depending on your state of mind and the sensations in your legs as you tick them off.
