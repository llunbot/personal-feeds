We’re looking for characteristics such as narrow roads, crucial descents before a final, and of course, time trials,” Gasparotto said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>G O O S E B U M P S <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giro</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FXLOtzOo0E\">pic.twitter.com/FXLOtzOo0E</a></p>\n<p>— Giro d’Italia (@giroditalia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/giroditalia/status/1651982678114156547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some cases, a Giro recon might be as low-key as one director driving a stage local to home.</p>\n<p>In the ideal scenario, a half-dozen riders and staff tack a mini recon camp around Strade Bianche, Milan-San Remo or Tirreno-Adriatico.</p>\n<p>Putting tires to tarmac allows team leaders to test road surfaces, consider descents, and visualize what’s to come.</p>\n<p>“It always helps to know what’s coming,” said Bewley, who only recently retired after a long career with the Orica-BikeExchange squad.</p>\n<p>“You might ride the route and think, ‘Maybe I’ll attack here where it’s steeper and there’s a corner,’ or get an idea of what sort of power you can do to go away over a climb.”</p>\n<p>No detail is too small to notice during a pre-race recon.</p>\n<p>Features like traffic islands, pinchpoints, technical descents and sketchy surfaces could become the center of a scheme that scores the stage victories and GC coups that make history.</p>\n<p>Pink jersey favorite Evenepoel and his Soudal Quick-Step team started their Giro d’Italia scouting process last November.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel took his new rainbow jersey to check the stage 9 Emilia Romagna time trial and some potentially hazardous hilly stages through the center and north of Italy.</p>\n<p>“We especially did recons of the first week because we saw that there can be some tricky stages there,” Evenepoel said this winter.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to see the medium mountain stages in particular. Because if one team does something crazy, you need to be ready, you need to know what you can expect.”</p>\n<h2>Shortcuts and deep dives via online data</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.velonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-12.01.19-720x437.png?width=720\" alt width=\"720\" height=\"437\" /><figcaption><span>The VeloViewer page for the Tre Cime di Lavaredo climb of stage 19 will have seen a haul of hits ahead of the Giro – but only legs will decide who can conquer its slopes.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>So what do platforms like Strava and VeloViewer bring to the recon mix?</p>\n<p>For teams short of staffers and resources, or in cases of bad weather, a lot.</p>\n<p>“VeloViewer is really valuable for giving a good idea of things if you can’t properly look at the stage,” Bewley said. “Sometimes a team just don’t have the manpower to go and do a recon.</p>\n<p>“Before, without VeloViewer, you might sacrifice an altitude camp to go do a recon – you would have had no idea what the stage is going to be like otherwise,” he added.</p>\n<p>“But now, teams can put focus on other things and still get a good idea of what’s coming.”</p>\n<p>Online data becomes a stopgap for teams that couldn’t carry out a recon, and add a new level of insight for those that did.</p>\n<p>VeloViewer piles data into a platform built around Strava segments. Interactive 3D maps, gradient analyses, and weather impacts all collate into a dream resource for riders, directors, and weekend warriors alike.</p>\n<p>The database became such a crucial tool to the WorldTour that it expanded its offering to include a package designed specifically for pro teams.</p>\n<p>“We have more than 100 teams signed up now,” VeloViewer founder Ben Lowe told <em>VeloNews</em>. “All men’s WorldTour and almost all ProTeams. Also loads of women’s teams, Conti teams, national teams, and a few domestic teams.”</p>\n<p>But for directors, preparing for a grand tour isn’t a one-stop VeloViewer shop.</p>\n<p>Multiple online sources come together to build even the shortest team briefing.</p>\n<p>Google Streetview is used to identify road furniture, roundabouts, and sometimes even potholes in a painstaking process that can take days.</p>\n<p>Pro-level “Strava stalking” helps staff estimate climbing times on key ascents, allowing them to compute the watt/kilo figures, energy expenditures, and nutrition strategies that will be shared during pre-stage meets.</p>\n<p>There are now even apps that overlay weather forecasts and wind directions onto road maps, a boon for any team with eyes on blowing up a race with crosswind maneuvers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Riders of the Giro d’Italia, I have some bad news;</p>\n<p>VeloViewer says that you’ll have almost 3000 more metres of climbing to do than the official Giro website.</p>\n<p>Oh, and you’ll be doing a total of 111km in the neutralised zones.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, it all looks straight forward.</p>\n<p>— Daniel Lloyd?

To defend? I just like seeing it personally.”</p>\n<p>Bewley, who has fresh experience as both a rider and a director, agrees.</p>\n<p>“People do recon less now with the access to VeloViewer and all those sorts of things,” he said. “But I don’t think you can ever replace being there to see things properly.”</p>\n<p>Will a pre-race recon decide who wins the pink jersey this month?</p>\n<p>In a Giro d’Italia packing more than 70km of leg-sapping time trials and boasting a brutal final week through the mountains, possibly not.</p>\n<p>But a reconnaissance sure might help the future pink jersey let his legs make the difference.</p>\n<p>“Mountain stages are about the legs. If you don’t have the legs, you can do as many recons as you want, you will drop,” Evenepoel said.</p>","author":"Cara McKee","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"9c0eaa3c5457261df45b72972a8e378694072231ace99f1e5b7d00c8662b92e7","category":"Cycling"}
