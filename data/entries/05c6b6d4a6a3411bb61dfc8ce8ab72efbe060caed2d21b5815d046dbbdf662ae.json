Forget that, because we found the perfect Cyber Monday deal: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windowsbased-Androidbased-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK/\">Amazon is selling the 1TB SK Hynix Beetle X31 for $63</a>, a savings of 26 percent discount and a new all-time-low price. In fact, you’re saving <em>nearly $350</em> on the price Apple charges for a 1TB upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With up to 1050MB/s, this drive is super fast and can quickly transfer files for you, backing up all that extra data you have on your computer. Of course, this portable SSD is not great just for backing up your laptop data, as you can also use it with your Mac mini or iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drive’s name is “Beetle,” although its golden color makes us think more of Egyptian scarabs. Either way, it has a gorgeous finish that will complement Apple’s Starlight MacBooks well and look great with a Space Black machine too. And with a distinct design, it’ll look great on a desk too. It also comes with a clear silicon travel case that’ll keep it scratch-free when you toss it in a bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss out on this fantastic deal and add 1TB of storage space by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windowsbased-Androidbased-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK/\">getting the SK Hynix Beetle X31 while it’s on Cyber Monday sale at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get an extra 1TB of storage for $63</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windowsbased-Androidbased-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"05c6b6d4a6a3411bb61dfc8ce8ab72efbe060caed2d21b5815d046dbbdf662ae","category":"Apple"}
