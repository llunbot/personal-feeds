{"title":"Rudy Giuliani Is Losing Everything to the Georgia Election Workers He Defamed","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-georgia-election-workers/index.html","date":1729633160000,"content":"\n<p>Katelyn Polantz, reporting for CNN:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A federal judge on Tuesday ordered former Donald Trump attorney\nand New York mayor Rudy Giuliani to turn over all his valuable\npossessions and his Manhattan penthouse apartment to the control\nof Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the Georgia election workers he\ndefamed and to whom he now owes $150 million.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Lewis Liman of the federal court in Manhattan said Giuliani\nmust turn over his interest in the property to the women in seven\ndays, to a receivership they will control. The judge’s turnover\norder of the luxury items is swift and simple, but the penthouse\napartment will have its control transferred so Freeman and Moss\ncan sell it, potentially for millions of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>The women, who counted Georgia ballots after the 2020 election,\nwill also be entitled to about $2 million in legal fees Giuliani\nhas said the Trump campaign still owes him, the judge ruled.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the Trump campaign fees and the New York apartment,\nGiuliani must also turn over a collection of several watches,\nincluding ones given to him by European presidents after the\nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks; a signed Joe DiMaggio jersey and\nother sports memorabilia; and a 1980 Mercedes once owned by the\nHollywood star Lauren Bacall. Additionally, the judge ordered that\nGiuliani turn over his television, items of furniture and jewelry.</p>\n\n<p>Liman hasn’t yet decided if Giuliani will be able to keep a Palm\nBeach, Florida, condominium he also owns, or the four New York\nYankees World Series rings he has, which Giuliani’s son contends\nhis father gave him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Donald Trump has numerous super powers. One of them is the way that — to date — he’s suffered few consequences for crimes committed in his name. Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg didn’t just do time, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/allen-weisselberg-released-from-jail-former-trump-organization-cfo/\">he served <em>hard time</em> in Rikers Island</a>. Former White House official Peter Navarro? Prison. Steve Bannon? Prison. Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen? Prison. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/03/07/trump-associates-prison-sentence-crimes-list\">The list goes on</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as a result of his efforts on behalf of Trump to attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, Rudy Giuliani is seemingly destitute. Rightly so. The whole “America’s Mayor” schtick was unearned, but he had it. He had respect and wealth. Now he doesn’t even own a fucking television. His whole life thrown away in disgrace to do the bidding of Donald Trump, who at this point surely wouldn’t even answer a phone call from Giuliani, let alone actually help him.</p>\n\n<p>Trump, meanwhile, is a nerve-rackingly close election away from escaping unscathed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/22/giuliani-getting-his\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"98f718c6ad78bb15f05c0117aa4ac24aa75819078d2a32ab32ac20e536439dcb","category":"Tech"}
