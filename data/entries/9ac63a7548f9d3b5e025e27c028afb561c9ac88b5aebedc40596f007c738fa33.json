Short, slightly stooped but still spry, the great framebuilder is nearly lost behind his vast mahogany desk and a litany of awards, photographs and memorabilia that covers almost every wall and surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bicycles are very much where his heart is and seemingly always have been. He cheerfully regales us with the tale of forging papers to secure his first job as a welder’s assistant in the Gloria bicycle factory when he was just 13 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young apprentice progressed quickly, and by the time he turned 20 in 1952, he had set himself up as a subcontractor, building bicycles for other companies in Cambiago, just outside Milan.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"772\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-772x970.jpg\" alt=\"classic_bikes_colnago_03\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-772x970.jpg 772w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-239x300.jpg 239w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-768x965.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-1222x1536.jpg 1222w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-1629x2048.jpg 1629w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-750x943.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03-1140x1433.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171139/classic_bikes_colnago_03.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Two years later, in 1954, he’d begun selling bicycles with his own surname on the down tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus started an illustrious career that has seen Colnago make bikes for everyone from Eddy Merckx to Pope John Paul II, the latter ‘a keen cyclist’ whose Colnago-made gold-chrome bike now sits in a sealed case at the company’s factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trophies and accolades came thick and fast, as did a cult following, yet it’s the innovations themselves that Ernesto Colnago is most proud of as he walks us through his private museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s a Paris-Roubaix winning fleet, five Colnago victories with the Mapei team, or a never-seen-the-light-of-day track bike, here is a man very much still in love with the very idea of the bicycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘Mosca’ Master, 1980</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171145/classic_bikes_colnago_02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"classic_bikes_colnago_02\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I made this bike with the Master tubes, which are crimped,’ says Ernesto Colnago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The idea for the Master tube shape came to me some years before when I was in Tokyo. I could not sleep because of jetlag, and I started thinking what if tubes were not round, could they be stiffer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The crimped shape I came up with has a better bending resistance of 15%. This bike really needed to be stiff. It was built for a Russian track athlete who was very heavy – more than 100kg. He was competing in the Olympics in the kilo, which is all about power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘With one stem it was impossible to make the bike strong enough for him, so I used two stems, one either side of the fork crown.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago says he cannot remember the name of the rider, and further research suggests that, despite the name, this bike might not have ended up at the 1980 Moscow Games after all, and was instead a prototype made in 1979 as a forerunner to kitting out the Soviet team the following year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, Colnago is not sure. What isn’t up for debate, however, is just how extreme the position is, and just how well the Soviet team did in Moscow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They won the 100km team time-trial, team pursuit and road race aboard Colnago bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rominger hour record, 1996</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"926\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-926x970.jpg\" alt=\"classic_bikes_colnago_04\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-926x970.jpg 926w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-287x300.jpg 287w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-768x804.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-1467x1536.jpg 1467w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-1956x2048.jpg 1956w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-750x785.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04-1140x1194.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171151/classic_bikes_colnago_04.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Immediately after Tony Rominger broke the Hour record in 1994 he said to me he can go faster, he can break 57km, so I started work on this bike, a collaboration with Ferrari.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘To go further the bike had to be the most aerodynamic possible in every detail, so the cranks are made from titanium to my designs, with the leading edges almost as sharp as knives to cut the wind, and the track nuts are rounded and smoothed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The bars are a special project with me and ITM, but the most important aerodynamic features are the frame and the wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Look at the wheels.

He’d won multiple Grand Tour stages, the rainbow stripes, a Vuelta a España and two green jerseys, but form was eluding him on the bike and financial woes eclipsing him off it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor money management and bad investments had left him a huge unpaid tax bill. Then came the summer of 1981, racing on the Boule d’Or-Colnago team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First he took the points jersey at the Tour in July, and then in August came the World Road Championships in Prague.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is the bicycle that Maertens rode in Prague,’ says Colnago. ‘It is a steel frame with round tubes, although by now I was already using crimped Master tubes in other bikes.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171205/classic_bikes_colnago_07-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"classic_bikes_colnago_07\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s ‘traditional’ – a lugged steel frame with a raked fork – but there are still plenty of flourishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Colnago name is engraved in the top eyes of the seatstays, chainrings and fork crown, and embossed into the chainstays, and an alarming amount of material has been drilled out from brake levers and chainset and milled from the seatpost to save weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked, and Maertens beat Giuseppe Saronni and Bernard Hinault.
