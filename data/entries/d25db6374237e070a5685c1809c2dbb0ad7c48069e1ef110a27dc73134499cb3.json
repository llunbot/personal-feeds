{"title":"Apple Watch Ultra 2 to Be Available in Dark Titanium, Says Leaker","link":"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1686388137633918976","date":1691075916000,"content":"\n<p>Leaker ShrimpApplePro, on Twitter/X:<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Watch Ultra 2. Same design. And I can confirm this year we\nwill have the black titanium this year along with the current\nstandard titanium.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yours truly, reviewing the Apple Watch Ultra last year:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don’t own the silver link bracelet to try it, but I suspect it\n<em>doesn’t</em> play paired with the Ultra. Brushed stainless steel and\ntitanium are too different to be considered a match, but too\nsimilar to have deliberate contrast. I wish Apple were committed\nenough to the Link Bracelet to make a new one in titanium to match\nthe case of the Ultra. (I also hope that future generations of\nApple Watch Ultra are available with a space gray or black\ncoating.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The last Apple Watch I bought for myself was a Series 7 in space black titanium. Given that the original Ultra was a hit, it seems like a no-brainer to offer it in a dark option this year. I think the biggest logistical complication for Apple with this is that it will multiply <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/watch/bands/apple-watch-ultra-49mm\">the number of Ultra straps they need to offer</a> — the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands have titanium fixtures that ought to match the watch case, and ideally, they’d color match the buckle hardware on the elastomer Ocean Bands too. But there’s a reason they put the COO in charge of Apple Watch.</p>\n\n<p>One question I have: is the Action button going to remain orange, or is that color going to change each year? I’m hoping it stays orange. (The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/\">orange hints on Vision Pro’s head strap</a> suggest the color is more than a seasonal fad.)</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/\">Via MacRumors</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><small>* I’ll drop the “Twitter” when twitter.com starts redirecting to x.com, and not the other way around. Even with the slapdash way they’ve enacted this name change, you’d think that would’ve happened by now. Must be a complicated mess behind the scenes.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/dark-apple-watch-ultra\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d25db6374237e070a5685c1809c2dbb0ad7c48069e1ef110a27dc73134499cb3","category":"Tech"}
