The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0BZHZ56M9?th=1\">30W Ugreen Uno is on sale for 30 percent off ahead of Black Friday</a>, bringing the price down to $18.19 at Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking like a little robot, the Ugreen Uno features a USB-C port and delivers up to 30W of power, which is more than enough for most tablets and smartphones, and even the MacBook Air. The little shoes of this wall charger are magnetic, so you can “park” it somewhere when you’re not using it. The charger itself is cube-shaped and features a small display that emotes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little face pops on the screen when you plug it in, complete with eyes and a little mouth (or is it a nose?). When the charging process is complete, the screen only shows the smiling eyes. While you may not check your device as often to see if it has reached 100 percent, this cute power adapter will be easy to see from across a room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus this Ugreen Uno features GaN technology, which means it’s going to provide more efficient and fast charging while also heating up less than a regular power adapter. So add this playful little fellow to your desk by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0BZHZ56M9?th=1\">buying the Ugreen Uno for $18.19 straight away</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Charge up all your Apple gear</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0BZHZ56M9?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7444242d392cb87a421a261b5eefdb77e7d072e8d6bbcfd5f6d28e08f33344e3","category":"Apple"}
