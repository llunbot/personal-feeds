These same benefits would extend to a future Vision Pro that adopts the technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current Vision Pro is equipped with two 4K micro-OLED displays supplied by Sony.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how Apple described the Vision Pro's display system in its press release announcing the mixed-reality headset last year:<blockquote>Featuring a breakthrough ultra-high-resolution display system built on top of an Apple silicon chip, Vision Pro uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, with wide colour and high dynamic range. This technological breakthrough, combined with custom catadioptric lenses that enable incredible sharpness and clarity, delivers jaw-dropping experiences.</blockquote>All in all, the technology now exists for the next-generation Vision Pro to feature even brighter and more power efficient displays in a few years from now.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/vision-pro-tandem-oled-report/\">iPad Pro's Tandem OLED Display Tech Could Extend to Future Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pros-tandem-oled-display-tech-could-extend-to-future-vision-pro.2432610/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c3d15d155ad1ce1931927ebe4f8a46e6cd6c080ea440ed386864ba1e3943c6b","category":"Apple"}
