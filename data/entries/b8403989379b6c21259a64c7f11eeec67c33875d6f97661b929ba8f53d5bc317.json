About 10 years ago, some tech companies would joke about an idea that was thought to be fun and unfeasible on April 1st, to the delight of readers. Jeff Barr has also posted seemingly far-fetched ideas on this blog in the past, and some of these have surprisingly come true! Here are examples:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Year</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Joke</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Reality</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>2010</td> \n   <td><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-qc2-the-quantum-compute-cloud/\">Introducing QC2 – the Quantum Compute Cloud</a>, a production-ready quantum computer to solve certain types of math and logic problems with breathtaking speed.</td> \n   <td>In 2019, we launched <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-braket-get-started-with-quantum-computing/\">Amazon Braket</a>, a fully managed service that allows scientists, researchers, and developers to begin experimenting with computers from multiple quantum hardware providers in a single place.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>2011</td> \n   <td><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-name/\">Announcing AWS $NAME</a>, a scalable event service to find and automatically integrate with your systems on the cloud, on premises, and even your house and room.</td> \n   <td>In 2019, we introduced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eventbridge-event-driven-aws-integration-for-your-saas-applications/\">Amazon EventBridge</a> to make it easy for you to integrate your own AWS applications with third-party applications.

The same goes for the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/\">generative artificial intelligence (generative AI)</a> world. Here are some launches that utilize generative AI technology this week.</p> \n<p><strong>Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/knowledge-bases-amazon-bedrock-claude-3-sonnet/\">Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model (FM)</a> is now generally available on Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock to connect internal data sources for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG).</p> \n<p>Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock support <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/knowledge-bases-amazon-bedrock-metadata-filtering/\">metadata filtering</a>, which improves retrieval accuracy by ensuring the documents are relevant to the query. You can narrow search results by specifying which documents to include or exclude from a query, resulting in more relevant responses generated by FMs such as Claude 3 Sonnet.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/03/29/2024-kb-for-amazon-bedrock.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"760\" /></p> \n<p>Finally, you can <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/knowledge-bases-amazon-bedrock-customize-prompts-number-retrieval-results/\">customize prompts and number of retrieval results</a> in Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock. With custom prompts, you can tailor the prompt instructions by adding context, user input, or output indicator(s), for the model to generate responses that more closely match your use case needs. You can now control the amount of information needed to generate a final response by adjusting the number of retrieved passages. To learn more these new features, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html\">Knowledge bases for Amazon Bedrock</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Connect Contact Lens</strong> – At AWS re:Invent 2023, we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-generative-ai-features-in-amazon-connect-including-amazon-q-facilitate-improved-contact-center-service/\">previewed a generative AI capability</a> to summarize long customer conversations into succinct, coherent, and context-rich contact summaries to help improve contact quality and agent performance.

Previously, when you activated resource tags for cost allocation purposes, the tags only took effect prospectively. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-allocation-backfill.html\">Submit a backfill request</a>, specifying the duration of time you want the cost allocation tags to be backfilled. Once the backfill is complete, the cost and usage data from prior months will be tagged with the current cost allocation tags.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What’s New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><strong><u>Other AWS News</u></strong><br /> Some other updates and news about generative AI that you might have missed:</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon and Anthropic’s AI investiment</strong> – Read the <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-anthropic-ai-investment\">latest milestone</a> in our strategic collaboration and investment with Anthropic.
