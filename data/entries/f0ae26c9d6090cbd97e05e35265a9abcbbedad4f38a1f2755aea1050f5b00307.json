From the original <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/analogue-nt-a-museum-grade-nes-for-a-museum-grade-price/\">Analogue Nt</a>, which used chips harvested from broken NES consoles, to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/\">Analogue Pocket</a>, which uses an FPGA chip to accurately emulate handheld hardware, the company has always focused on modern hardware that can play actual game cartridges while preserving the idiosyncrasies of the original game consoles.</p>\n<p>Today, Analogue is announcing the <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/3d\">Analogue 3D</a>, a console that will use an FPGA to run games made for 1996’s Nintendo 64. Because FPGAs emulate consoles at a hardware level, they're much better at replicating all of the specific quirks of the original hardware, making games look and run like they would have on the original consoles without any performance problems or rendering inaccuracies. Like Analogue's other home console replicas, the Analogue 3D is designed to play original cartridges and not ROM files, and the cartridge slot is region-free, so it'll work with games from all over the world.</p>\n<p>Analogue didn't reveal a price or a specific launch date for the Analogue 3D, just that the console will show up sometime in 2024. It also didn't show off the design of the console itself or the controller, though it did tease both—if you look closely, you'll see <a href=\"https://www.8bitdo.com/\">an 8BitDo logo</a> on the controller, the same company that made Analogue's replica controllers for its Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and TurboGrafx retro consoles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976202#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976202&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f0ae26c9d6090cbd97e05e35265a9abcbbedad4f38a1f2755aea1050f5b00307","category":"Tech"}
