We laughed. We cried. We hurled. Bonds were forged, never to be broken. And I hope we all took a little something special away from the journey—namely, a dynamically updating DNS and DHCP setup. Which we're now going to put to use!</p>\n<p>If you're joining us fresh, without having gone through the previous part and wanting to follow this tutorial, howdy! There might be some parts that are more difficult to complete without a local instance of bind (or other authoritative resolver compatible with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsupdate\">nsupdate</a>). We'll talk more about this when we get there, but just know that if you want to pause and go <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/doing-dns-and-dhcp-for-your-lan-the-old-way-the-way-that-works/\">do part one first</a>, you may have an easier time following along.</p>\n<h2>The quick version: A LetsEncrypt of our own</h2>\n<p>This article will walk through the process of installing <a href=\"https://github.com/smallstep/certificates\">step-ca</a>, a standalone certificate authority-in-a-box. We'll then configure step-ca with an ACME provisioner—that's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment\">Automatic Certificate Management Environment</a>, the technology that underpins LetsEncrypt and facilitates the automatic provisioning, renewal, and revocation of SSL/TLS certificates.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009175#p3\">Read 118 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009175&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"feff4752df8d5f920626a6ccd16dd98cc11e1c7f078f3268c3900031b715ed61","category":"Tech"}
