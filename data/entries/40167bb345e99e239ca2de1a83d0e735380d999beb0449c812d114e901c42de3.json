The pricing gap between the 14 and 16-inch options will be \"much more narrow\" than the current 13 and 16-inch high-end MacBook Pro options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDisplay analyst Ross Young earlier today said that the new MacBook Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/macbook-pro-120hz-mini-led-display/\">could feature</a> a 120Hz refresh rate for the mini-LED displays, and Dylandkt claims that 120Hz was \"being tested on a Mac prototype\" earlier in the year, but that he has \"no clue when it's coming.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFull details on the new 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will be announced next Monday, and until then, we have a roundup of all of the rumors we've heard so far available <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">in our MacBook Pro guide</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2021-apple-event/\">October 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/macbook-pro-upgraded-webcams-new-power-brick/\">MacBook Pro Models Said to Start at 16GB RAM and 512GB Storage, Feature Upgraded 1080p Webcams and New Charging Brick</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-models-said-to-start-at-16gb-ram-and-512gb-storage-feature-upgraded-1080p-webcams-and-new-charging-brick.2316642/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=c0CGDEyoVfQ:Kf-1XerGUrc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=c0CGDEyoVfQ:Kf-1XerGUrc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/c0CGDEyoVfQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40167bb345e99e239ca2de1a83d0e735380d999beb0449c812d114e901c42de3","category":"Apple"}
