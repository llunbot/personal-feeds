That’s <em>Prime</em> pronounced as ‘preem’, like you’d win in a cycling race. That’s fitting as the Prime collection includes what Specialized is calling their lightest full-featured jersey ever, the Prime LT. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Prime LT jersey\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Specialized-Prime-LT-jersey-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Bikerumor)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially see-through, there’s not much to the Prime LT jersey except for pockets on mesh. Impressively for an 82g jersey, there are four very useable pockets, including a large zippered pocket for valuables. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized claims to have taken their lightest material and made it 20% lighter. The resulting jersey is now <em>37%</em> lighter than the standard Prime jersey with a full zipper and pockets. They claim that this is the lightest full-featured jersey on the planet – less than an empty 26oz water bottle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sheer material is also said to move sweat away from your body 17% faster than any previous Specialized jersey. It seems like a great option for extremely hot days, though you may want to sunscreen up before putting it on. You’ll also want to size up when it comes to the jersey itself – I’m usually between a small and a medium, and our medium sample fits more like an XS. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-800x450.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BRD-11259_Prime_OnePager-2880x1620-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prime Collection Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the Prime collection features close-to-body fit with strategically placed UPF panels, high airflow, and rapid moisture wicking for long days in hot conditions. The colors are said to be inspired the by landscapes we ride in, with three palettes including Coastal Fog, Valley Floor, and Desert Plains. All of the pieces in the new Prime collection have been redesigned to include all-day details to make long rides more comfortable including an optional SWAT bib with mesh pockets on the thighs and lower back for additional storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re longing for warmer days in the saddle, check out the full collection at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/prime-apparel\" target=\"_blank\">specialized.com </a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/second-specialized-prime-apparel-collection-lightest-full-featured-jersey/\">Second Specialized Prime Apparel Collection Includes Lightest Full-Featured Jersey?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9548be30d809dda86e4eadd74db1df4db42428d7099dba6c0d9ad8911b4d3752","category":"Cycling"}
