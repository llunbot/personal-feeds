The Apple silicon chip will be a replacement for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Max, and it is set to be used in new MacBook Pro models next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg\" alt width=\"1810\" height=\"1018\" />\r<br />\nSigns of the chip were found by a third-party Mac developer in test logs, and it appears to feature a 40-core GPU and a 16-core CPU with 12 high performance cores and four efficiency cores. Comparatively, the current ‌M2‌ Max chip features a 12-core CPU and a 38-core GPU. The test machine also includes 48GB memory, but there will likely be higher upgrade options available as the current MacBook Pro supports up to 96GB memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's ‌M3‌ Max chip is expected to be built on a new 3-nanometer process, resulting in speed and efficiency improvements compared to the ‌M2‌ Max chip. Apple is testing the chip in an unreleased high-end MacBook Pro that's codenamed \"J514.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌M3‌ Max will be the higher-end chip in a trio that also includes the ‌M3‌ and the ‌M3‌ Pro. The ‌M3‌ chip will include an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, while the ‌M3‌ Pro will feature a 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the first ‌M3‌ Macs in October, but will likely focus on machines that use the standard ‌M3‌ chip, such as the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> models. 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that include the ‌M3‌ Max chip are expected to come out in 2024.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-m3-max-chip/\">Apple Testing M3 Max Chip With 16-Core CPU and 40-Core GPU</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-testing-m3-max-chip-with-16-core-cpu-and-40-core-gpu.2398024/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cb584d1bc29286bc8047dabb6d002b754c7c993e3c3ccdd5387c0f9f27cc6530","category":"Apple"}
