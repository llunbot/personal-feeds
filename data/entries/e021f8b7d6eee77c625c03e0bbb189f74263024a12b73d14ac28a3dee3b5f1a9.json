Some users on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/1hm2dro/save_the_date/\">Reddit have speculated</a> that Apple might be planning to launch a promotion that gives people free access to ‌Apple TV‌+ for a two-day period, though others believe that it could be a preview for upcoming 2025 TV shows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Stay tuned. <a href=\"https://t.co/ph7k2Wh75G\">pic.twitter.com/ph7k2Wh75G</a></p>— Apple TV (@AppleTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1872298393172865218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nJanuary 4 and January 5 fall on a weekend, and the \"see for yourself\" wording does seem to suggest that a free watching period could be a possibility. Apple may share additional information in the days leading up to the \"event\" that gives us more insight.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has never done a free all-you-can-watch ‌Apple TV‌+ event, but it does offer free trials for new subscribers and it provides the first episodes of some shows so that potential customers can get a preview before choosing to subscribe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple TV‌+ is priced at $9.99 per month, and up to six members of a Family Sharing group are able to watch content at that price point.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/26/apple-tv-plus-january-teaser/\">Apple Teases Apple TV+ Surprise on January 4 and 5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-teases-apple-tv-surprise-on-january-4-and-5.2446161/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e021f8b7d6eee77c625c03e0bbb189f74263024a12b73d14ac28a3dee3b5f1a9","category":"Apple"}
