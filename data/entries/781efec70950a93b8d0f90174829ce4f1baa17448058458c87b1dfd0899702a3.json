One of those tools was\nClips, which <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/04/06/apple-launches-new-social-focused-clips-video-editing-app-for-iphone-ipad\">arrived in 2017</a> to little fanfare and has\nbeen forgotten since.</p>\n\n<p>Meta and ByteDance have a reason to push their respective video\nediting apps — brand synergy. More users mean more data, more\ncontent, and more ad revenue. Apple, however, doesn’t have the\nsame motivation.</p>\n\n<p>While Apple would likely love to see users flock to Clips, it\nwould mean entering a race to satisfy a wave of several million\ncustomers in an app and interface that was never really more than\na proof of concept. It would be a money pit with very little\nreward as Apple doesn’t have a social platform to drive users to\nor a way to monetize the app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I completely agree with Hilliard that the announcement of Edits is the perfect time to mention Clips. I completely disagree with him that Apple has no motivation to dedicate itself to the task of making Clips incredible.</p>\n\n<p>A mobile-first video editor isn’t a “money pit”. It’s an app. Apple makes a lot of apps, and they could easily afford to assign a team to make Clips truly great. It’s no different than 20–25 years ago, when Apple dedicated itself to making iMovie and Final Cut both great apps. It’s no different than the motivation to create GarageBand. The monetization wouldn’t be direct; it would be downstream of the general idea that if you’re editing videos for social media on your phone, the best app to do it with is from Apple and it’s exclusively available on iPhone. The idea is that Apple doesn’t just make the best computing devices for artists, writers, and creators, but they also make some of the best apps for those fields too.</p>\n\n<p>There are actually a lot of interesting UI ideas in Clips. But if Apple isn’t interested in making Clips truly great for people who actually love editing videos using their phones, they should just abandon it. Make it great or give up. Keeping it around as an also-ran that no one uses is a bad look. This is the sort of thing Apple should pride itself on: best-of-breed creative tools.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know if Edits is a rip-off of CapCut or not, but it’s definitely not a rip-off of Clips. It’s a good rule of thumb that when Apple succeeds at something, it gets ripped off. The better the Apple product, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/22/byford-china-android-forks\">the more shamelessly it gets copied</a>. Apple should make Clips into an iOS video editing app that everyone rips off shamelessly.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"781efec70950a93b8d0f90174829ce4f1baa17448058458c87b1dfd0899702a3","category":"Tech"}
