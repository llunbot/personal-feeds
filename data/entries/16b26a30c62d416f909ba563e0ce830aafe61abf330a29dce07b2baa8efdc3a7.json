Qualcomm's Snapdragon X SoCs were launched alongside <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/\">a pile of AI-related software announcements</a>, but they're impressive mostly because they're very good at basic computer-y things: They feel fast, and they enable good battery life.</p>\n<p>Despite the \"AI\" that AMD has added to the name, I'm looking at the new Ryzen AI 300-series pretty much the same way. The test system AMD provided—a 16-inch <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/us/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606/\">Asus ZenBook UM5606W</a> with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and an integrated Radeon 890M GPU in it—shows that the chip is a small but significant bump over the older Ryzen 7000- and 8000-series laptop CPUs. For various reasons, those chips were already a bit easier to recommend than Intel's 13th-generation Core processors and both Ultra and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/intel-freshens-up-its-old-laptop-and-desktop-cpus-with-speed-bumps-new-names/\">non-Ultra</a> Intel Core CPUs, and the Ryzen AI upgrade provides solid boosts to CPU performance and graphics while still maintaining good power efficiency and battery life.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040553#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040553&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"16b26a30c62d416f909ba563e0ce830aafe61abf330a29dce07b2baa8efdc3a7","category":"Tech"}
