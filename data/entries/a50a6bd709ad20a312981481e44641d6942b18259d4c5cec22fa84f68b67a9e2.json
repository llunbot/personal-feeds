The two named plaintiffs said they never would have purchased or been willing to pay as much for an iPhone 16 had they known that Apple's marketing surrounding the features was false and misleading.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple advertised the Siri features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/\">in product presentations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/apple-website-siri-features-fine-print/\">on its website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-pulls-iphone-16-ad-more-personal-siri/\">in a TV commercial starring actor Bella Ramsey</a>, and elsewhere.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/\">already sued over the delayed Siri features</a> in California last month, and the class action lawsuits could eventually be merged if they proceed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA similar complaint was filed against Apple last week <a href=\"https://vancouversun.com/news/class-action-lawsuit-alleges-apple-false-ai-promises-iphone-16\">in the Canadian province of British Columbia</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first previewed the personalized Siri features during its WWDC 2024 keynote last June, as part of a wide range of Apple Intelligence features that it said would be rolling out over the course of the following year. That gave Apple until WWDC 2025 this June to roll out the Siri features, but last month the company announced that it needed more time and anticipated rolling out the features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">at some point \"in the coming year\"</a> from then.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe features were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/\">initially expected to launch in iOS 18.4</a> last week, but they are now expected to arrive at some point during the iOS 19 cycle. Many well-connected Apple reporters and observers believe the features will not be available until 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe class action lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada are both seeking damages from Apple, in an amount to be proven at trial, so class members who purchased an iPhone 16 in order to use the personalized Siri features could eventually receive a payout from Apple, if the judges presiding over each case find that the company broke the law.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's lawyers have yet to respond to any of the lawsuits.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-hit-with-more-siri-delay-lawsuits/\">Apple Hit With More Class Action Lawsuits Over Delayed Siri Features in U.S. and Canada</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-hit-with-more-class-action-lawsuits-over-delayed-siri-features-in-u-s-and-canada.2455072/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a50a6bd709ad20a312981481e44641d6942b18259d4c5cec22fa84f68b67a9e2","category":"Apple"}
