To install apps that Gatekeeper blocks, users will need to open up System Settings and go to the Privacy and Security section to \"review security information\" before being able to run the software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome ‌macOS Sequoia‌ users <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/07/05/sequoia-removes-gatekeeper-contextual-menu-override/\">have already noticed</a> that the function was removed, but Apple today confirmed that it is no longer available in the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recommends that software distributed outside of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a> be submitted for notarization, a process that scans Developer ID-signed software and performs security checks. Notarized software does not trigger Gatekeeper.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGatekeeper ensures that Macs only run \"trusted\" software in order to protect users from malware, viruses, and other security risks. Gatekeeper checks to make sure that software comes from an identified developer and is free from malicious content.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/macos-sequoia-gatekeeper-security-change/\">macOS Sequoia Makes It Harder to Override Gatekeeper Security</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-makes-it-harder-to-override-gatekeeper-security.2433066/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"569a7099c9584f4187259255f4b06e03bac25f521088988b0794fc4bdff35820","category":"Apple"}
