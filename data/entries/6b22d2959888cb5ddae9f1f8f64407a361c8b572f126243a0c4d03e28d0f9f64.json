In terms of your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a>, you’re looking at zones 5 to 6 for the effort and zone 1 in between. </span></p>\n<p><span>When applied to cycling, there is no one set way to perform a HIIT workout, with different sessions offering different benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The duration of efforts could be from a couple of seconds up to a minute or more,” explains Matt Rowe of</span> <span>Rowe &amp; King Cycle Coaching</span><span>.</span><span> “There’s no real hard or fast definition of it, other than you’ve got to be cycling hard and with great intensity on and off. </span></p>\n<p><span>“You can make it as structured or unstructured as you like. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/get-fitter-on-every-ride-with-fartlek/\">Fartlek</a> training is seemingly random efforts, and that’s a form of HIIT training.”</span></p>\n<h2>What are the benefits and drawbacks of HIIT?</h2>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Intense sessions don’t need to last much more than an hour.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>One of the biggest benefits of a HIIT workout is the short amount of time it takes to complete a session.</span></p>\n<p><span>“It allows you to accumulate a lot of high-quality work at that top end of your fitness and really maximises the bang for your buck from any training session,” says Dr David Nichols, cycle training consultant for Wattbike.</span></p>\n<p><span>Most sessions can be done in an hour or less and are easy to do on the turbo trainer, so you can squeeze a ride in with long-lasting benefits from the comfort of your own home. </span></p>\n<p><span>“If you’re time-poor, you’ve got to be smart with what you do have,” says Matt Bottrill of </span><span>Matt Bottrill Performance Coaching</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s possible to see a tangible training benefit from a session as short as 30 or 40 minutes, according to Bottrill, but he warns against over-reliance on HIIT workouts. “You can’t do it every day,” he says. “It’s not feasibly possible because you can’t hit that high intensity.”</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In an endurance sport such as cycling, explosivity is often neglected.</span></figcaption><span> <i>THOMAS SAMSON/AFP via Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The intensity of HIIT workouts can also help you to target the top-end training that might otherwise be missing from your rides, complementing your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/base-training-cycling/\">base training</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/sweetspot-training/\">sweetspot intervals</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>“When you go out cycling, most people ride steady and they think they’re going quite hard,” says Rowe. “But you’re not really engaging your fast-twitch muscle fibres that much. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The fast-twitch fibres can make all the difference in cycling. If you need to get up a climb and use a big surge in effort, that’s your fast-twitch fibres that you’re relying on. HIIT training does that perfectly.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Because HIIT intervals are short, they enable you to accumulate a lot of time at an intensity above what you’d otherwise be able to sustain in continuous blocks. That, in turn, helps improve your </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/vo2-max/\"><span>VO2 max</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/what-is-ftp-and-why-it-matters-for-cyclists/\"><span>threshold power,</span></a><span> according to Nichols.</span></p>\n<h3>Drawbacks<b><br /></b></h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hit the intervals too hard and you’ll leave yourself spent.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>While high-intensity interval training is time-efficient and provides plenty of bang for your buck, it isn’t a miracle session that can simply replace all of the other workouts in your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-plan-your-winter-training/\">training plan</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Due to the nature of HIIT workouts, you need to be able to train at extremely high intensities during each session, and therefore need to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/the-basics-of-recovery-explained/\">recover properly</a> between workouts. </span></p>\n<p><span>“There’s no point in doing a top-end training session if you go into it so fatigued that you can’t reach the top end – you just end up training in that middle ground,” explains Nichols. </span></p>\n<p><span>“By incorporating HIIT, you’ve got to be a bit smarter – are you going to have a rest day before it? What is your training session going to look like after that? You can’t just keep periodically smashing yourself.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Nichols recommends two HIIT sessions a week – and a maximum of three – otherwise you risk <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/overtraining-syndrome/\">overtraining</a>. “You can have too much of a good thing,” he adds.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’ll need to fit in steadier rides around HIIT sessions to maintain aerobic fitness.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>If you do decide to add HIIT workouts to your training, Rowe says it’s important to not neglect the rest of your riding. “</span><span>If you purely do HIIT training, you’re going to struggle with your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/5-ways-to-improve-your-cycling-endurance/\">endurance</a> because it’s all about short, sharp efforts,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bottrill agrees, adding that you still need to be logging the miles to see the true benefits of HIIT workouts translated on the road. “</span><span>You’ve still got to do that endurance base,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>He also recommends keeping HIIT to a limited phase of a training block when you want to sharpen your fitness, because of how mentally challenging sessions can be. “The hardest bit is your head,” he says. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The sessions take a lot out of you. You can find it very hard to then complete the next session. If you’re going to do that type of training, you’d probably want to build a six-week phase of it. Any more and you can’t go as deep mentally.”</span></p>\n<h2>Indoors or outdoors?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Considering the effort you’ll be putting in, an indoor trainer is a safer option than the open road.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>While HIIT training can be done both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/indoor-vs-outdoor-cycle-training/\">indoors or outdoors</a>, all the coaches we spoke to leaned towards an indoor setting on a turbo trainer or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/indoor-bikes/\">smart bike</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I personally prefer to do it indoors,” says Wattbike’s Nichols. “It’s convenient, set up ready to go and there’s no time-wasting. </span><span>Doing it outdoors can negate the time effectiveness of HIIT.”</span></p>\n<p>As well as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-take-ftp-test-zwift/\">FTP and ramp tests</a>, the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling apps</a> offer structured <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/best-workouts-training-plans-zwift/\">workouts and training plans</a>, many of which include HIIT-style interval sessions. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">best smart trainers</a> can control the resistance for each interval, ensuring you hit the numbers required to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-get-fit-fast/\">get fit fast</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A steady incline is ideal for HIIT because most people find it easier to punch out power uphill.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>If you do opt to train outside, Bottrill recommends planning a circuit that is either flat or uphill.</span></p>\n<p><span>“You don’t want it to be too undulating and you want to control the environment,” he says. “That’s where a hill comes good – you can ascend a climb that’s three to four minutes and then recover on the descent.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Rowe adds that it’s also possible to turn your commute into a HIIT workout, albeit an unstructured fartlek-style session: “</span><span>Maybe as part of your commute, you could sprint to a signpost and do seemingly random efforts like that.”</span></p>\n<p>Of course, as with any high-intensity ride outside, make sure you are paying full attention to your surroundings at all times.</p>\n<h2>How can I include HIIT in my training plan?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> To use HIIT effectively, alternate between hard and easy days.</span></figcaption><span> <i>TrainerRoad</i></span></div>\n<p><span>As we’ve already covered, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing with high-intensity interval training, so it’s recommended to stick to a maximum of two to three sessions per week interspersed with longer endurance rides to really see the benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, f</span><span>or riders who can only squeeze in a short session around other commitments, Rowe would always recommend a HIIT workout.</span></p>\n<p><span>“A well-rounded training plan touches on all different attributes,” he says. </span><span>“</span><span>Sweetspot sessions</span><span> are great, but at least once a week you should be doing some top-end work. The frequency at which you do it is very personal, but in the winter you have to do whatever you can in the amount of time you’ve got. </span></p>\n<p><span>“If you’ve only got 40 minutes to train, in that 40 minutes you might as well ride hard, so HIIT works for that.”</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ride longer and slower when you have more time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The fatigue-inducing nature of HIIT workouts makes it advisable to plan your sessions in advance to avoid overtraining. Nichols recommends scheduling your HIIT sessions around easy or rest days, and using a weekend ride to work on your endurance.</span></p>\n<p><span>“A ride at the weekend is going to be your long endurance ride, maybe a club run or group ride,” he says. “Outside of that, you can do two midweek interval sessions. These are your absolute high-effort, high-intensity training sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span>“If that’s Tuesday and Thursday, you’re going to have Monday and Wednesday easy because you’ve got to schedule that recovery in.”</span></p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h2>Two example HIIT workouts for cyclists</h2>\n<h3>Matt Rowe’s HIIT pyramid</h3>\n<p>Each ‘on’ interval should be in zone five if you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-vs-heart-rate/\">train with a power meter</a>.
