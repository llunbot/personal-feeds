{"title":"Apple’s 2023 App Store Transparency Report (PDF)","link":"https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2023-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf","date":1716237081000,"content":"\n<p>One segment that caught my attention:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apps removed from the App Store subject to government takedown\ndemands: 1,462</p>\n\n<p>By country or region:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>China mainland: 1,285</li>\n<li>South Korea: 103</li>\n<li>India: 30</li>\n<li>Russia 12</li>\n<li>Indonesia: 8</li>\n<li>Lithuania: 5</li>\n<li>Ukraine: 5</li>\n<li>Malaysia: 2</li>\n<li>Mexico: 2</li>\n<li>Philippines: 2</li>\n<li>Thailand: 2</li>\n<li>Türkiye: 2</li>\n<li>Hungary: 1</li>\n<li>Libya: 1</li>\n<li>Pakistan: 1</li>\n<li>Vietnam: 1</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are footnotes on the China and South Korea numbers. For China it says “There were 1,067 game apps removed for lack of a legally required GRN license.” That’s a 2020 law that requires a government license <a href=\"https://appinchina.co/how-to-get-a-game-license-in-china/\">for any paid game</a>. For South Korea, which one doesn’t think of as a repressive country, it says “There were 102 game apps removed for their inappropriate age rating”, which accounts for all but one of them.</p>\n\n<p>A few other items:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li>Average weekly app downloads: 787,999,950</li>\n<li>Average weekly app redownloads: 1,656,894,821</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I long suspected users engage in frequent churn with certain apps installed on their phones, but this seemingly puts a number to it: redownloading previously installed apps is more than twice as popular as downloading new apps. But 788 million weekly app downloads is a big number.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li>Average weekly automatic app updates: 52,623,848,130</li>\n<li>Average weekly manual app updates: 562,782,228</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No surprise that automatic app updates dwarf manual updates, given that automatic updates have been the default setting for many years. These numbers indicate there are almost 100× more automatic updates than manual ones. (I update manually, typically each day, because I enjoy perusing the release notes, just in case there’s anything interesting in them. I’m glad Apple still offers manual updates as a setting.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/20/2023-app-store-transparency-report\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"94fdc127f953c6bcfc58be8e29872986883d53a2cd3c2d72d7f552623afc94f2","category":"Tech"}
