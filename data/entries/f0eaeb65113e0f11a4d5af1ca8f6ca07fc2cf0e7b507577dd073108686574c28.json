The new implementation allows for massively improved throughput on 10Gbps LAN connections—and on many WI-Fi connections, as well.</p>\n<h2>WireGuard (on Windows) and Wintun</h2>\n<p>The original implementation of WireGuard on Windows uses wireguard-go—a userspace implementation of WireGuard written in Google's Go programming language. Wireguard-go is then tied to a virtual network device, the majority of which also lives in userspace. Donenfeld didn't like <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenVPN/tap-windows\">tap-windows</a>, the virtual network interface provided by the OpenVPN project—so he implemented his own replacement from scratch, called <a href=\"https://www.wintun.net/\">Wintun</a>.</p>\n<p>Wintun is a definite improvement over tap-windows—the OpenVPN project itself has implemented Wintun support, with impressive <a href=\"https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/PerformanceTestingOpenVPN\">results</a> (414Mbps over tap-windows vs 737Mbps over Wintun). But while using Wintun is an improvement over tap-windows, it doesn't change the need for constant context switches from kernel space (where the \"real\" network stack lives) and userspace (where OpenVPN and wireguard-go both live).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784606#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784606&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f0eaeb65113e0f11a4d5af1ca8f6ca07fc2cf0e7b507577dd073108686574c28","category":"Tech"}
