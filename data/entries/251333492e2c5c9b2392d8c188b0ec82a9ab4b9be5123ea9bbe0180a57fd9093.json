{"title":"Goodyear Launches 710g Peak SL XC Tire, Plus New Dirt & Park DJ Tires!","link":"https://bikerumor.com/goodyear-710g-peak-sl-xc-tire-new-dirt-park-dj-tires/","date":1688754375000,"content":"<p>Looking for a light weight XC race tire that is properly wide? The new Goodyear Peak SL looks like it will fit the bill with a 29 x 2.4″ size that checks in at a claimed 710g. That light weight also doesn’t come at the expense of sidewall protection either…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction.png\"><img width=\"2121\" height=\"1451\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction.png\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction.png 2121w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction-297x203.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction-800x547.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction-120x82.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction-768x525.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction-1536x1051.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-tire-construction-2048x1401.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the addition of ‘Mono fabric’ at the sidewall, their M:Wall Sidewall protection layer should give the 120 tpi casing a boost in durability (at the highest product level). Note that the tire will be offered in 29 x 2.25 or 29 x 2.4″. Claimed weight for the 2.25″ version is just 680g, with the 2.4″ version bumping up to 710g. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Goodyear Peak SL tread pattern\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goodyear-Peak-SL-XC-race-tire-MTB-Dirt-Park-DJ-Pump-track5.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using an updated low profile tread pattern from the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/goodyear-peak-ultimate-xc-mountain-bike-tires-first-rides-actual-weights/\" target=\"_blank\">Peak Ultimate tires</a>, the Peak SL tires should also be even lighter weight.

exactly as they sound with the Street tire running a smooth tread with plenty of siping, and the Dirt tire running a low profile knobby tread. Run them however you need – Dirt/Dirt, Street/Street, or Dirt in the front and Street in the back for the best of both worlds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These will be offered in 26 x 2.2 initially, and are likely to sell for $45-50 each. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.goodyearbike.com\" target=\"_blank\">goodyearbike.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/goodyear-710g-peak-sl-xc-tire-new-dirt-park-dj-tires/\">Goodyear Launches 710g Peak SL XC Tire, Plus New Dirt &amp; Park DJ Tires!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"251333492e2c5c9b2392d8c188b0ec82a9ab4b9be5123ea9bbe0180a57fd9093","category":"Cycling"}
