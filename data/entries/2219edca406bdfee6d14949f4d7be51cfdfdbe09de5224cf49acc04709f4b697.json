They can grow to more than 300 feet wide, thousands of feet long, and hundreds of feet deep. Water from melting snow on the surface can flow through crevasses all the way to the base of the ice, joining with other hidden streams to form a vast drainage system that affects how fast glaciers and ice sheets flow.</span></p>\n<p><span>The study found that crevasses are expanding more quickly than previously detected, and somewhere between 50 and 90 percent of the water flowing through the Greenland Ice Sheet goes through crevasses, which can warm deeply submerged portions of the glacier and increase lubrication between the base of the ice sheet and the bedrock it flows over. Both those mechanisms can accelerate the flow of the ice itself, said </span><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/tomchudley.bsky.social\"><span>Thomas Chudley</span></a><span>, a glaciologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, who is lead author of the new study.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/greenlands-glaciers-are-falling-apart-faster-than-expected/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/greenlands-glaciers-are-falling-apart-faster-than-expected/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Bob Berwyn, Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2219edca406bdfee6d14949f4d7be51cfdfdbe09de5224cf49acc04709f4b697","category":"Tech"}
