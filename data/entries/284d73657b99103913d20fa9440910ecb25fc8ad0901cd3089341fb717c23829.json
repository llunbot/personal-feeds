The new Reserve 40|44 GR wheels are 27.4mm/27.mm wide. That’s the <em>internal </em>width, not external. That makes them wider than some current XC mountain bike wheels, though that kinda makes sense with how gravel bikes are being ridden these days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reserve states that the added width allows the rims to accommodate tires up to 50mm wide, with the recommended tire range listed as 30-50mm in width. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than just being super wide, the 40|44 GR claims to be super aero as well. While Reserve was founded by Santa Cruz Bicycles in 2014, they’ve gradually made their way from MTB, to gravel, to Pro Tour road racing with Team Jumbo Visma in 2022. Given that Santa Cruz / Reserve and Cervelo are now both owned by PON, the collaboration makes sense and it has allowed the two very unique brands to work on a unifying project – aerodynamics. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Reserve carbon wheels 40 44 GR turbulent aero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-19-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using what they call “exclusive Turbulent Aero wind tunnel testing,” the Reserve 40|44 GR shape was validated with simulated real-world airflow.

The front is a 40mm depth with a 27.2mm internal width, while the rear is a bit taller and narrower at 44mm deep and 27mm internal. Externally, the rims measure 36/34.4mm wide, and both run 24 straight pull spokes. Those spoke holes are internally reinforced to resist pull-out with specifically engineered carbon plies that Reserve has <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/no-tire-no-problem-danny-macaskill-puts-santa-cruz-reserve-carbon-wheels-test/\" target=\"_blank\">developed over years of building carbon rims</a> for mountain bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than use a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/uci-to-perform-urgent-study-of-hookless-rims-tubeless-tires-to-address-safety-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\">hookless design</a>, Reserve uses what they are calling “semi-hooked”. There is a definite lip around the edge of the rim, and it allows the rims to offer an 80 psi maximum pressure which seems pretty high for a rim this wide meant for gravel bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-40-44-GR-wheel-specs.png\"><img width=\"652\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-40-44-GR-wheel-specs.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-40-44-GR-wheel-specs.png 652w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-40-44-GR-wheel-specs-297x203.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-40-44-GR-wheel-specs-120x82.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Reserve carbon wheels 40 44 GR DT Swiss center lock hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-15-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Reserve carbon wheels 40 44 GR rear hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-16-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 40|44 GR wheels are only offered in one build with a Centerlock DT Swiss 350 EXP hub set with a 36t ratchet.

Out of the box, the rim tape on both wheels needed some attention. One wheel had the valve hole punched in the tape so it was an oval that the Fillmore valves wouldn’t seal. The other had the end of the tape lifting up, so both rims required some extra tape to be added to offer an air-tight seal. We’ve seen similar issues on other brand wheels from time to time, so it’s not a Reserve specific issue. Just be sure to inspect your tape before installing the tires and valves, and if there’s an issue Reserve will help you out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also planning to run these wheels on a bike with a GRX 12-speed 1x drivetrain which required a Microspline freehub. As mentioned above, Reserve isn’t offering a Microspline option yet, so I sourced my own. It was an easy swap, and the hubs were ready to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still pretty wet outside, so I opted to install some WTB Raddler 700c x 44mm tires I had on hand. While the first tire bead was a little tight to install, the second bead went on easier without tools. With some sealant in the tire, the beads seated very easily, immediately sealing without any additional effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"Reserve carbon wheels 40 44 GR tire profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-1-2048x1280.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I’ve used the Raddlers previously, they’ve never quite measured a true 44mm. But on the 40|44 GR wheels, they measured 44mm almost immediately. One thing is for sure, rims this wide will impact the shape of narrower tires. On the Raddlers, the tread ends up fairly flat, with the widest point of the tire being the sidewall by a large margin. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1563\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6.jpg\" alt=\"Reserve carbon wheels 40 44 GR on titanium gravel Otso Warakin Ti\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-carbon-wheels-Gravel-40-44-GR-Reveiw-6-2048x1280.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On my first few rides, the 40|44 GR wheels are easy to love. In my opinion, the Raddlers aren’t a particularly fast tire, especially on pavement. Yet when mounted to the Reserve wheels, they feel faster than I remember. Coupled with the carbon rims, the ride quality is fantastic – which is only accentuated by the quiet freehub of the DT Swiss hubs. I don’t mind loud freehubs on the mountain bike, but on the road or gravel, I find the louder hubs more intrusive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t say that the wheels felt particularly aero, but the sense of speed and stability seems to reinforce Reserve’s claims. Considering that these wheels are guaranteed for life with free replacements, I would not hesitate to buy these for daily use even though they’re the perfect option for your next gravel race.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://reservewheels.com/products/40-44-gr\" target=\"_blank\">reservewheels.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/reserve-40-44-carbon-grave-racel-wheels/\">Ultra Wide Reserve 40 I 44 Gravel Wheels are More Aerodynamic, Guaranteed for Life</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"284d73657b99103913d20fa9440910ecb25fc8ad0901cd3089341fb717c23829","category":"Cycling"}
