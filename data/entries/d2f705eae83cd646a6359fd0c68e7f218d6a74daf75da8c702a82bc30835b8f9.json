Kim Vorrath, a 37-year Apple veteran, will join the AI team to work under AI chief John Giannandrea.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nVorrath is a program management VP, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/04/22/kim-vorrath-bug-wrangler/\">has a reputation</a> for meticulously managing software projects at Apple and ensuring employees meet deadlines. She has been described as Apple's \"bug wrangler\" and as a \"powerful force\" in the company. For the last few years, she has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/31/apple-ar-team-bug-wrangler/\">working on Apple's AR/VR team</a> developing the Vision Pro headset, but now she is being moved to AI.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe news comes just after a widely circulated story <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/siri-eagles-33-false-super-bowl-wins-basic-test/\">about Siri's failure</a> to accurately provide basic knowledge about Super Bowl results. ‌Siri‌ has long been seen as inferior to other personal assistants, and in recent years, ‌Siri‌ has been unable to measure up to AI-based chatbots.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/apple-intelligence-fake-headline-clarification/\">addressing widespread criticism </a>of its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> Notification summary feature, which has on several occasions mistakenly summarized news stories in a way that produced confusing false headlines. To fix the problem, Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/ios-18-3-news-notifications-removed/\">temporarily removing Notification summaries</a> for news and entertainment apps in iOS 18.3, an update expected next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple attempted to improve ‌Siri‌ by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into ‌Apple Intelligence‌, but there are still serious problems with ‌Siri‌. Additional ‌Siri‌ features are going to be coming in the near future as part of an iOS 18.4 update, and in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>, Apple is rumored to be planning to introduce an LLM version of ‌Siri‌ that will be comparable to ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Vorrath's move to the AI team is a signal that the company sees AI as more important than the Vision Pro. Vorrath is known for organizing engineering groups and redesigning workflows with new processes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a memo announcing the change, Giannandrea said that Apple plans to focus on improving the ‌Siri‌ infrastructure as well as Apple's in-house AI models.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/apple-siri-team-changes/\">Apple Brings in New Exec to 'Fix' Siri and Apple Intelligence</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-brings-in-new-exec-to-fix-siri-and-apple-intelligence.2448050/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2f705eae83cd646a6359fd0c68e7f218d6a74daf75da8c702a82bc30835b8f9","category":"Apple"}
