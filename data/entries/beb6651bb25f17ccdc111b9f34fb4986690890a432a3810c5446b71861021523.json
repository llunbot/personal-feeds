In the latest beta update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-10-to-developers/\">released this morning</a>, Universal Control settings that have been manually enabled have a \"Beta\" label.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe \"Beta\" labeling suggests that Apple could be planning to make the feature available to users when ‌macOS Monterey‌ launches, even if all the bugs have not been worked out. Apple did something similar for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>+ Private Relay feature, which is also available in a beta capacity at the current time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUniversal Control, which is an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a> and Monterey feature, is designed to allow multiple Macs and iPads to be operated the same time using the same input devices, so Mac and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> owners can use a single mouse and keyboard across more than one Mac, more than one ‌iPad‌, or a mix of Macs and iPads.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/universal-control-monterey-beta-10-beta-label/\">Universal Control Remains Unavailable in macOS Monterey Beta 10, But Now Has 'Beta' Label</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/universal-control-remains-unavailable-in-macos-monterey-beta-10-but-now-has-beta-label.2316798/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=87BOei9B2go:4tj686Mefyw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=87BOei9B2go:4tj686Mefyw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/87BOei9B2go\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"beb6651bb25f17ccdc111b9f34fb4986690890a432a3810c5446b71861021523","category":"Apple"}
