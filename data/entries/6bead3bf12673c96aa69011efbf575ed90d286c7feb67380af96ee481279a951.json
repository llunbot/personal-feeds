Fortunately, it was recently rumored that a new Apple TV will launch at some point next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we recap rumors about the next-generation Apple TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last week reported that Apple has been working on its own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that will roll out in multiple devices next year, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/\">new Apple TV and HomePod mini models</a>. He said the chip will <strong>support Wi-Fi 6E</strong>, which would be an upgrade over the current Apple TV's standard Wi-Fi 6 support. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible device and router. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/\">adding a <strong>built-in camera</strong></a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/\">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, the next Apple TV is also expected to be equipped with a <strong>newer chip for faster performance</strong>. The current Apple TV is equipped with the A15 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 13 models in 2021. Apple has released several newer A-series chips since then, including the A16 Bionic, A17 Pro, A18, and A18 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe next Apple TV could have <strong>lower pricing</strong>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/\">could have a sub-$100 starting price</a>. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for $129 and $149, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear exactly when in 2025 the new Apple TV would launch.
