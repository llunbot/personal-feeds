Porsche extended the wheelbase and moved the pedal box behind the front wheels, allowing the 962 to be approved for racing. These IMSA-spec 962s began with Porsche’s Type 962/70 2.8-liter flat six engines with air-cooling only and a single turbo, as twin-turbo systems were not allowed in the IMSA GTP class at the time. The 962-102 was campaigned by legendary driver Bob Akin in 1984.

From the 917 (which gave Porsche its first overall win in 1970) to the 936 (which won in 1976, 1977, and 1981), all of Porsche's cars used a relatively fragile tubeframe chassis clad in fiberglass bodywork.</p>\n<p>But the 956 exchanged this old way of doing things for a much more up-to-date approach. The chassis this time was an aluminum monocoque with much greater stiffness—and much better driver safety.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792283#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792283&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
