Absoluteblack says having a flexible cage allows for better alignment with the higher gears and reduces friction, thus saving watts, as the pulley isn't fighting the chain.</p>\n<p>Alignment is helped further by removing a part of the cage and making a mono-plate cage that is more adaptable to different angles.</p>\n<p>To increase the stiffness of the guide pulley, the Hollowcage uses oversized, full ceramic bearings, which are said to bring superior shifting to other pulley cage systems. Absoluteblack explains: 'Most oversized pulley cage systems use very small bearings, with a lot of lateral play at the teeth, which in turn provide poor, sloppy shifting.'</p>\n<p>For further shifting improvement, the Hollowcage's upper pulley has tall teeth that help to boost the precision of the shifting when compared to the shallow teeth of its competitors.</p>\n<h3>Watt's in it for me?</h3>\n<p>Aside from sonic and textural improvements, Absoluteblack says the Hollowcage is actually more aerodynamic than both the Dura-Ace cage and the 'market leading' competitor, though it admits the differences are small enough that there aren't any 'meaningful watt losses' between the options.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9904/absoluteblack-hollowcage-oversized-pulley-cage-images#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/absoluteblack-hollowcage-carbon-ceramic-7.jpg?itok=keWJNngv\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>7</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>It says the biggest saving comes from the spring tension and the cage's adaptibility to the chainline, which, thanks to the tall teeth and mono-plate design, gives the Hollowcage an advantage on the rest of the market.</p>\n<p>It's apparently also one of the lightest oversized cages you can buy, weighing in at 71g.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9938/peter-sagan-to-leave-bora-hansgrohe-at-end-of-season\">Peter Sagan to leave Bora-Hansgrohe at end of season</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9954/bora-hansgrohe-sign-sam-bennett-and-new-sprint-train\">Bora-Hansgrohe sign Sam Bennett and new sprint train</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 116: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Options and price</h3>\n<p>Whle the Absoluteblack Hollowcage isn't cheap, setting you back £519, it is available in rainbow, titanium, red and gold as well as the slick black.</p>\n<p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://absoluteblack.cc/hollowcage-carbon-ceramic-oversized-derailleur-pulley-cage\" target=\"_blank\">absoluteblack.cc</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9904/absoluteblack-hollowcage-oversized-pulley-cage-images\">Absoluteblack Hollowcage oversized pulley cage images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>20 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9904%2Fabsoluteblack-hollowcage-oversized-pulley-cage-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Absoluteblack%20Hollowcage%20oversized%20pulley%20cage%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9904%2Fabsoluteblack-hollowcage-oversized-pulley-cage-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Absoluteblack%20Hollowcage%20oversized%20pulley%20cage%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9904%2Fabsoluteblack-hollowcage-oversized-pulley-cage-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Absoluteblack%20Hollowcage%20oversized%20pulley%20cage%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9904%2Fabsoluteblack-hollowcage-oversized-pulley-cage-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9904/absoluteblack-hollowcage-oversized-pulley-cage-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/absoluteblack-hollowcage-carbon-ceramic-2.jpg?itok=0_M6fL-K\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/components\">Components</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f372f7297499850dd94fca1c20bec51717dd374b01e5f8e0b09dd9fd8e9f2aa4","category":"Cycling"}
