There is also an extra ring of lights around the sensor's perimeter, but it is unclear what it is for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe prototype was running an internal build of watchOS 11.1 that was never released to the public, according to @StellaFudge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Prototype Apple Watch Series 10 with… A very unique health sensor arrangement.<br /><br />The health sensors got shrunk down a lot and there was an extra light ring around the perimeter. The watch is also running an unreleased build of watchOS11, somewhere between 11.1b5 and 11.1rc. <a href=\"https://t.co/8n06JkQT39\">pic.twitter.com/8n06JkQT39</a></p>— Stella - Fudge (@StellaFudge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StellaFudge/status/1906777369546727641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nThe health sensor on the back of the Apple Watch is used to measure the wearer's heart rate, as well as blood oxygen on models sold outside of the United States only due to a patent dispute. It is unclear why the sensor looks different on this prototype, but the changes likely related to Apple testing future health features for the Apple Watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor example, Apple has reportedly been testing a feature that could alert you to signs of high blood pressure. This feature was first rumored a few years before the Apple Watch Series 10 launched, but Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/apple-watch-blood-pressure-feature-snags/\">continues to face development challenges</a>. It is unclear if the feature will be ready in time for the Apple Watch Series 11.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-watch-series-10-prototype/\">Apple Watch Series 10 Prototype With Unique Health Sensor Revealed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-10-prototype-with-unique-health-sensor-revealed.2454389/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e1fade1122fbb1a9a8dc3a7e534cf23f06fe3ab17d1e1f86fb5555b140b5c442","category":"Apple"}
