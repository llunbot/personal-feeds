A former U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the operation is still active.</blockquote>REvil's \"Happy Blog\" that was used to leak stolen documents has been taken offline and is no longer available. The hacker group went offline back in July as well after law enforcement and intelligence specialists were able to hack into REvil's computer network, but it returned last month and servers previously compromised by the government were again used for this second takedown.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nREvil was also responsible for a May cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline that caused gas shortages on the East Coast of the United States.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/revil-ransomware-group-taken-offline/\">Ransomware Group That Stole Apple's MacBook Pro Schematics Taken Offline in Multi-Country Operation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ransomware-group-that-stole-apples-macbook-pro-schematics-taken-offline-in-multi-country-operation.2318550/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zufZsPSN5u0:wqtKTJZQoUw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zufZsPSN5u0:wqtKTJZQoUw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zufZsPSN5u0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9e16d6cce56eede740649552ec4901bffe47821ada07d8b36cba32596d9c95a1","category":"Apple"}
