As of iOS 16.5 and iPadOS 16.5, however, affected users say the adapter no longer powers any devices connected to both of the ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue is likely due to a software bug that will need to be addressed in a future iOS version, but the underlying cause is unknown. Apple seeded the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/ios-16-6-beta-1/\">first beta of iOS 16.6</a> to developers today, but the update is likely many weeks away from being released, so an iOS 16.5.1 update might be necessary if the company wishes to fix the bug sooner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-releases-ios-16-5/\">released iOS 16.5</a> on Thursday following seven weeks of beta testing. The update is a relatively minor one, with additions including a Sports tab in the Apple News app, a new Pride Celebration wallpaper honoring the LGBTQ+ community and culture, and bug fixes related to CarPlay, Screen Time, and Spotlight. Apple is expected to announce iOS 17 with bigger changes during its WWDC keynote <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">on June 5</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/ios-16-5-bug-with-lightning-usb-3-camera-adapter/\">Apple's Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter Not Working With iOS 16.5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter-not-working-with-ios-16-5.2390025/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8d6ded5fd01206fdaad03477ac62903c57d26cc97c48600875c19db2b4fd1118","category":"Apple"}
