While CES officially begins tomorrow, there are pre-show events like CES Unveiled, plus Samsung shared highlights.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nSamsung often uses CES to show off new TV technology, and 2025 was no exception. There's a new NEO 8K flagship TV, plus a new Frame Pro. The Frame Pro has better brightness and contrast, and an option to wirelessly display whatever output is connected to a One Connect Box, which gives more flexibility for the location of Apple TVs, consoles, sound bars, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSelect Samsung Smart TVs are set to gain Live Translate, an AI-powered feature that offers real-time translations as subtitles, even when subtitles aren't available as built-in content. AI is being used for generating wallpapers and some new personalization features, too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung has a new OLED Smart Monitor M9, a Studio Display competitor that has a sleek design. It offers an AI Picture Optimizer for adjusting display parameters to fit what's on-screen, and there is 4K AI upscaling. For gamers, Samsung showed off an OLED display with a 500Hz refresh rate and a 27-inch 4K OLED display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLG was also showing off new TV and display technology. The company had a new Evo OLED TV that's much brighter than prior models, plus there's also a connect box for peripherals so you don't need them by the TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt CES Unveiled, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/05/belkin-ces-2025-announcements/\">Belkin showed off</a> the Stage Power Grip, a 10,000mAh <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> powerbank that works as a camera grip for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> photography. Lexar had a tiny USB-C SSD that connects to an ‌iPhone‌, and Sharge had a Qi2 power bank with active cooling and an integrated kickstand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAtmos Gear demoed electric roller skates that can go up to 18 miles an hour, and there was a clever salt spoon that's supposed to zap your tongue in a specific area to make you taste salt without actually adding salt to your dish.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMake sure to watch the full video to see the products in action, and stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> because we'll be sharing CES videos and articles for the next few days.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">CES 2025</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/ces-2025-day-1/\">CES 2025 Day 1: Samsung Adds AI to TVs and Companies Get Clever With MagSafe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2025-day-1-samsung-adds-ai-to-tvs-and-companies-get-clever-with-magsafe.2446826/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c05fb6fc27a40b3ee69478da68b7191dcb96953fcca8fe4cb0be35cb7a84f920","category":"Apple"}
