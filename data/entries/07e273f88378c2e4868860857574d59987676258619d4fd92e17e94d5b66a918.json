{"title":"The $1100 AeroCoach Wheel Hub: Crap Engineering, only surpassed by the Diabolical Customer Service","link":"https://www.hambini.com/the-1100-aerocoach-wheel-hub-crap-engineering-only-surpassed-by-the-diabolical-customer-service/","date":1731918589000,"content":"The £900 AeroCoach Aeox wheel hub promised cutting-edge performance but delivered a masterclass in engineering failure. With garbage machining, grooves that weaken rather than strengthen, and a design doomed by radial lacing, it’s less a cycling component and more a £900 liability.
