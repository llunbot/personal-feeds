Neither sees much use now, partly because they use an outdated, 130mm BCD.</p>\n<p>The smallest chainring available for this BCD is 38t, and frankly, I’m too unfit to enjoy using anything larger than a 36t inner chainring on my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bike</a> these days, especially for serious climbs.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if you’d like to use a power meter across multiple bikes then being stuck with one BCD can prove tricky.</p>\n<p>Even a 110mm BCD – which Shimano now uses for its road cranksets – might be limiting for use on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bike</a>, because the smallest chainring usable with this BCD is a 33t.</p>\n<p>And while it’s still possible to get Shimano-compatible chainrings for a 130mm BCD spider with 5 bolt holes, there aren’t many (if any?) available options that are compatible with the latest SRAM AXS drivetrains, for example.</p>\n<p>These limitations can make upgrading your bike a frustrating process because you might have to rule out some new parts to keep an existing power meter running, or factor in more money for a new one.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor

having a wide-ranging chainring, crankset and axle ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Finally, because spider-based power meters don’t measure the efforts of each leg independently, they can only estimate left/right power balance.</p>\n<p>Whether this data can be used to improve performance is debatable, but if it’s something you want, a spider-based power meter won’t cut it.</p>\n<h3>Crank-based power

everything to be housed, and locating electronics on the inside face of each crank arm also means everything is well protected from crash damage.</p>\n<p>Because you have two individual power meters (assuming you have a dual-sided power meter crankset), measuring the power produced by each leg independently, it’s also possible to get highly accurate left/right balance data.</p>\n<p>It’s usually a pretty lightweight solution, too.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

difference between a standard Shimano crankset and a dual-sided power meter version (such as the <a

R9200</a> crankset.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, crank-based power meters also tie you to a specific crankset type, bottom bracket standard and, as with spider-based options, usually a certain chainring BCD as well.</p>\n<p>As a result, they come with most of the same compatibility issues as spider-based options mentioned above.</p>\n<p>A road crankset might be sub-optimal but still compatible with a gravel bike, for example, but it’s unlikely to work for double duty between road and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<h3>Pedal-based power meters</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">crankset</a> uses the same pedal thread standard (9/16in x 20 TPI), pedals are near-universal in terms of bike compatibility.</p>\n<p>This means no fussing with bottom brackets and crankets or being limited by BCDs, as well as peace of mind that the design is future-proof (assuming the bike industry doesn’t suddenly decide to ‘innovate’ in the pedal threads space).</p>\n<p>Installing pedal-based power meters is typically as easy as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-change-bike-pedals/\">changing any standard pedal</a>, too (which is to say, it’s generally very easy).</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

batteries, electronics and the like.</p>\n<p>As such, manufacturers essentially have two choices – place bulbous pods on the pedal spindles to help house everything, or shrink it all down to the point that it can all be squeezed within the axles.</p>\n<p>Favero and Wahoo do the former, while Garmin does the latter.</p>\n<p>Given the latter is likely difficult (and therefore also costly), it’s little surprise that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/garmin-rally-rs200-power-meter-pedals-review/\">Garmin’s Rally power meter pedals</a> (£869.99) are relatively

one type of pedal is suitable for every type of riding.</p>\n<p>A power meter based around a road-specific pedal body, such as the Look Keo, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">Shimano SPD-SL</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/wahoo-speedplay-zero-pedals-review/\">Wahoo Speedplay</a>, for example, is likely to be of little use on any bike that sees off-road use.</p>\n<p>This is because the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">cycling shoes</a> and cleats designed for these pedal systems typically aren’t designed for walking on.</p>\n<p>As things stand, those and Shimano SPD (off-road) are also the only cleat and pedal systems catered for by power meter brands.
