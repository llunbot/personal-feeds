When it comes time to recharge, Exposure has its own proprietary cable.</p>\n<p>Setup is fiddly both for the alloy mount and for the different beam patterns, which you need to select with the light off, meaning you have to go through the process again if you don’t like the result.</p>\n<p>It’s a beautifully made light, if expensive, although there are lower-priced options that don’t include the AKTiv tech.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/lights/front-light/exposure-strada-mk11-sb-aktiv-front-light-review/\">Read our full Exposure Strada review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Exposure Toro Mk14</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Exposure Toro Mk14 front light\" title=\"Exposure Toro Mk14 light - 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Toro has deep cooling fins and front-facing slot vents around the three LEDs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Claimed max output:</strong> 3,600 lumens</li>\n<li><strong>Run time (max power):</strong> 2 hours</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Beautifully made; sturdy mount</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive; heavy; takes up lots of bar space</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Exposure Toro Mk14 has a whopping 3,600 lumen output providing a wide field of illumination.</p>\n<p>The light is beautifully made and it comes with a CNC machined alloy mount.

Lumens are the unit by which the total amount of light emitted from a source is measured.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the amount of lumens a light offers tends to be the headline specification because a larger number essentially promises that the light will be brighter.</p>\n<p>The power of some bike lights – usually dynamo-powered headlights and StVZO-compliant battery-powered lights – is expressed in lux. This is the measure of how much light falls on a surface.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cateye GoPro adaptor and K-Edge Combo Mount out front GPS computer mount\" title=\"Cateye GoPro adaptor and K-Edge Combo Mount out front GPS computer mount\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 200 lumens is sufficient for riding in lit urban areas.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cyclists riding in lit urban areas, who don’t need lights to illuminate the road ahead, may only need a unit with a few hundred lumens – but if you venture on to unlit roads or paths, that’s unlikely to be enough, so you’ll need something more powerful.</p>\n<p>For urban commuting, 200 lumens should be sufficient. We would suggest a front light with a minimum of 400 lumens for riding on unlit roads.</p>\n<p>Don’t be fooled into thinking that the lumen rating of a bike light is the only thing that matters, though. A super-bright light that only has enough battery power to put out that headline figure for half an hour isn’t likely to be particularly useful, especially if you’ll need to use the most powerful setting for extended periods.</p>\n<p>Make sure you check the claimed battery life at all of the various power levels to find the most suitable light for your style of riding.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning at this point that, in the UK, bike lights are not subject to any upper limit in power. Lights must be able to emit at least four candela (another unit of light intensity), which is comfortably exceeded by modern lights. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/flashing-bike-lights/\">Flashing bike lights</a> are also permitted within UK law.</p>\n<h3>Are LEDs good for bike lights?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Lumicycle has a fantastic battery life.\" title=\"lumicyclehalogentwinlampliion-a3cc370\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Filament bulbs are, mercifully, a thing of the past.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The filament bulb is thankfully a thing of the past. Virtually all of today’s high-end front lights have Cree LEDs, which offer better brightness, more versatility, less heat, longer life and are smaller.</p>\n<p>Most rear lights now use COB LEDs. COB stands for ‘chip on board’ – essentially multiple LED chips forming a single module. They produce less heat, are brighter and can come in a variety of colours – but remember the law in most countries dictates a rear light must be red.</p>\n<h3>Battery life</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Magicshine Monteer 8000S mountain bike light\" title=\"Magicshine Monteer 8000S light-2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most road lights are all-in-one units that include the battery, but more powerful lights will usually have a separate battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-lights/\">mountain bike lights</a>, which often use dedicated external battery packs, lights for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a> and commuting usually have internal batteries, so there’s always going to be a trade-off between power, battery life and the size of the light.</p>\n<p>For example, a more powerful light, with a longer battery life will require a physically larger battery and will therefore increase the overall size of the unit.</p>\n<p>This isn’t necessarily a problem in itself, but many road cyclists won’t want something overly large to spoil the sleek looks of their road bike or clutter the handlebar. Likewise, some commuters will want lights that are small enough to be stuffed easily into a work bag.</p>\n<p>For others, especially those who ride on unlit roads or enjoy particularly long rides and commutes, a larger light with more lumens and battery capacity will be essential.</p>\n<h3>What about dynamo-powered lights?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SON Edelux II dynamo headlight\" title=\"SON Edelux II dynamo headlight\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dynamo lights offer some advantages compared to battery-powered lights.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Astute readers will notice that we have only covered battery-powered lights in this guide.</p>\n<p>Dynamo-powered lights – which, most commonly, are powered by a generator hub built into a wheel – are a very popular option on touring and town bikes, and with good reason. They offer infinite run time and the optics in the lights are often very high quality.</p>\n<p>However, they require a significant investment in terms of both money and research, and to cover both systems would be beyond the scope of this guide. We’ve covered <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-dynamos/\">bike dynamos</a> in a separate explainer, including our pick of the best dynamo lights.</p>\n<h3>Balance and beam pattern</h3>\n<p>When buying a set of lights, it’s also wise to consider the balance between the front and the rear.</p>\n<p>The front light will almost always have much more power because its role includes lighting dark roads and cycle paths. However, while the outright lumen count of most rear lights won’t come close to the front, the spec is just as important.</p>\n<p>A rear light’s main role is to help make you visible to other road users, so having decent brightness and battery life is essential because it needs to last the length of whatever ride you’re taking on while also being powerful enough for other road users to see it from a good distance.</p>\n<p>Some lights are now also marketed for daytime use, with the appropriate brightness and flash patterns to help keep you seen in bright sunshine and low light.</p>\n<p>Both front and rear lights should also balance range and peripheral lighting. A highly focused beam can be great for lighting the road in front of you for fast riding, but for the sake of both being able to spot hazards and to enable road users approaching from different angles to see you better, it’s important that some of the light beam spreads into the periphery as well.</p>\n<h4>What about StVZO lights?</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lupine SL AX StVZO bike light\" title=\"Lupine SL AX StVZO bike light\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> StVZO bike lights are a legal requirement in Germany.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Lupine</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/stvzo-bike-lights/\">StVZO bike lights</a> conform to German Road Traffic Licensing Regulations, with beam patterns shaped to avoid dazzling other road users.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to use StVZO-approved lights anywhere other than on German roads – however, if you ride solely on the road, investing in a StVZO light could be a good idea.</p>\n<p>The narrow beam might not suit mountain bikers or bikepackers cycling at night, but there are more StVZO light options becoming available that let you change between high and low beams to get around this issue.</p>\n<h3>Mount systems</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mount for the Exposure Sirius MK9 front road light\" title=\"Exposure Sirius MK9 06\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> How a light mounts to the bike is also worth considering.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In an ideal world, you would be able to have a mounting system that is perfectly simple, lightning-quick to install and remove, totally secure and infinitely durable… But in reality, there’s usually a bit of a compromise between those various characteristics.</p>\n<p>The simplest mounts use heavy-duty rubber bands and dedicated grooves on the light mount. These systems have the advantage of being extremely quick and easy to install and remove, and can usually be easily adjusted to different types and sizes of handlebar, seat posts, etc.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it’s easy to lose these elastic bands when the lights aren’t mounted on the bike and they’re more susceptible to movement over rough ground. Given long-term use, they’re also more likely to degrade and eventually break than a solid mount.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cateye GoPro adaptor and K-Edge Combo Mount out front GPS computer mount\" title=\"Cateye GoPro adaptor and K-Edge Combo Mount out front GPS computer mount\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A proper bolt-on light mount can work well if you don’t have to regularly remove the lights from your bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Solid plastic or metal mounting systems, which clip on to the handlebars and are secured with bolts, tend to offer much better security on bumpy roads as well as much greater long-term durability.</p>\n<p>Installing or removing these types of mounts can often be a much more involved process though, sometimes even requiring a specific tool (such as a small hex key).</p>\n<p>Usually, manufacturers will look to mitigate this inconvenience by making the light separately removable from the actual mount itself (so, for example, you can quickly take the light unit with you after locking up your bike), but not every light offers this function, so it’s worth checking before you buy.</p>\n<h3>Gravel bike lights</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Exposure Toro Mk14 front light\" title=\"Exposure Toro Mk14 light - 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A powerful light may be good a choice if you prefer technical gravel riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re looking for a set of bike lights for gravel riding there are several things to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>A gravel bike light should be more powerful than a road bike light to illuminate unlit trails and gravel paths. For gravel riding, it’s unlikely you’ll need the same amount of power as a mountain bike light because you’ll only really need to light the path in front of you rather than twisting and turning trails.</p>\n<p>Having said that, you may prefer a light for your gravel bike with a wider beam than a road bike light, because you’ll still likely be coming across more obstacles than you would on a road ride.</p>\n<p>We’d recommend a front light with a minimum of 600 lumens. You may prefer a gravel bike light with more power than this if you prefer technical gravel riding and taking your bike down the odd section of singletrack. Some of the 2,000-lumen lights in this list may prove a worthwhile – if not pricy – investment.</p>\n<p>A rear light for gravel riding should also be powerful. Riding on dark roads will mean your rear light will have to do more to keep you safe and seen.</p>\n<h3>Other features</h3>\n<p>Waterproofing is important, particularly if you regularly ride in poor weather conditions. The IP Code is a measurement of protection against the ingress of water and dust. IP4 protects against splashing of water, while an IP7 product will survive immersion in water for 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Some front lights not only power their own LEDs but have USB ports that allow you to charge mobiles or GPS computers – particularly useful for long-distance riders.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a242891f1ac3c63cad024c8df93f8fdf135cf2d0569bb69a7a0bd7ffdc43f982","category":"Cycling"}
