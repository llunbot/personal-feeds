However, the last Mophie Juice Pack release was in 2019, for the iPhone 11 series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owners of the iPhone 12, 13 and 14 had no Apple or Mophie battery cases to choose from. Battery cases still existed for these phones, but mostly from little-known Chinese makers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested a lot of these and our favorite iPhone battery case maker has been long-running Newdery (also Chinese), which we have trusted for power, safety and protection. But there was no real competition from better-known brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was therefore with excitement that we heard that Mophie was back in the game with a new Juice Pack battery case, with models for each of the iPhone 15 family except the 15 Plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main point of a battery case is to provide backup power when your iPhone needs it most—usually when you are on the move, away from a handy wall charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Juice Packs for iPhone 15 and 15 Pro each contain a 2,400mAh internal battery, while the more needy iPhone 15 Pro Max’s Juice Pack gets a meatier 3,000mAh battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested the Mophie Juice Pack with an iPhone 15 Pro, and it gave us an average of 56% extra battery life, which should be enough to get you through the day until you can charge the iPhone up again via a cable and wall charger or a dedicated MagSafe iPhone charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our roundups of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-iphone-fast-charging.html\" target=\"_blank\">best iPhone chargers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MagSafe chargers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The competition comes from battery case stalwart Newdery, which makes battery cases for the iPhone 15, 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max in two much larger capacities: 5000mAh and 10000mAh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our test iPhone 15 Pro was charged close to full (95%) using the Newdery 5000mAh battery case and 168% using the bulkier 10000mAh case. Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2189562/newdery-battery-case-for-iphone-15-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Newdery Battery Case for iPhone 15 review</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a significant difference in charging power compared to the Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 Pro, and there are compromises on both sides, mainly based around the battery case design.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case design\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>The Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 Pro (right) is a two-part case, compared to the one-part Newdery battery case (left).</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case design\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 Pro (right) is a two-part case, compared to the one-part Newdery battery case (left).</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case design\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs_compared-open.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 Pro (right) is a two-part case, compared to the one-part Newdery battery case (left).</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A battery case should offer robust protection like any phone case, with bumpers on all four sides and a tough back. The phone’s front should be protected from drops by a raised bezel that means the screen doesn’t contact the floor when it lands, inevitably, face down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mophie Juice Pack fulfils these criteria, and we feel confident that it protects the phone from everyday knocks, drops and scrapes. Mophie claims that it offers 6 feet of drop protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its tough external plastic case is made of sustainable PCR materials—with up to 50% post-consumer recycled plastics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a classic Mophie two-part design that is different from one-piece designs where you flex back the top part of the case before sliding in the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Juice Pack, the top quarter of the case needs to be pulled off before putting the phone inside or taking it out. This makes phone insertion less prone to potential breaks as the phone is more nimbly fed on to the USB-C connector at the base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, having two parts does introduce more points of failure if you are frequently taking the case part. As users keep their phone inside the vase most of the time, this shouldn’t be a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USB-C connector feels solid and is less bendable than the flimsier Lightning connector that older iPhones used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are physical buttons on the sides and front cut-outs for the iPhone’s bottom speakers and microphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you need the extra power from the case’s internal battery you just push the button at the back and charging commences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four LEDs indicate the current battery level and charge status of the case. You’ll still need to check the iPhone itself for its remaining battery power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can give your iPhone a quick burst or just flood the iPhone’s battery with everything the case can offer.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-Juice-Pack-iPhone-15-Battery-Pack_back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Battery case vs power bank</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A battery case is more convenient than a separate power bank as it should always be with you, where it is easy to forget to pack a charged power bank. It also offers protection for your phone, which a power bank is not able to do. We always recommend you always protect your phone in a case—we have tested the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2064242/best-iphone-15-cases.html\" target=\"_blank\">best iPhone 15 cases</a>—and having the back-up power in a battery case is a great bonus function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being charged via the case’s USB-C connector, they charge faster than via a wireless power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A power bank, on the other hand, is a more flexible solution. You get a wider choice of battery capacities—up to 27000mAh—and they aren’t obsolete when you change your phone for a newer model. Power banks are used only when you need them, so don’t add permanent bulk to your phone during the day. Read our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html\" target=\"_blank\">best iPhone power banks</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice depends on whether you don’t mind a little extra bulk on your phone. The Mophie Juice Pack is noticeably slimmer than most rival battery cases, but it is chunkier than your average phone case.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case vs Newdery battery case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>The Mophie Juice Pack, bottom, is noticeably slimmer than the Newdery battery case for iPhone 15 on top.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case vs Newdery battery case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The Mophie Juice Pack, bottom, is noticeably slimmer than the Newdery battery case for iPhone 15 on top.</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 battery case vs Newdery battery case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mophie-and-Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Packs-compared.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The Mophie Juice Pack, bottom, is noticeably slimmer than the Newdery battery case for iPhone 15 on top.</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15, 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max is priced at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.zagg.com/power/battery-cases/&amp;xcust=1-1-2329450-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$99.95</a> / <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://uk.zagg.com/mophie-juice-pack-2024/&amp;xcust=1-1-2329450-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">£99.95</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While high, that’s a reasonable price for the functionality and protection on offer.

It is slimmer and lighter (98g) than the Newdery alternative (132g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend the Mophie Juice Pack over the Newdery Battery Case, but a lot of people will be swayed by that price difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mophie Juice Pack battery case provides 50% backup power and protection for the iPhone 15. The internal 2,400mAh battery is one of the lowest-capacity options but the benefit of this is a much-reduced hump at the back of the slim case, in comparison to larger 5000mAh capacity battery cases that offer a full recharge but are bulkier and heavier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is undeniably more expensive than the Chinese competition, but it has a superior build, and even at the higher price is a great solution for people who find their phone fading during the day or who need to use their phone for long periods away from their wall charger.</p>\n\nMobile Phone Accessories, Mobile Phone Cases and Covers, Mobile Phone Chargers, Power</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"930f9ffd2db6cc2d13fe9856c41cdd0a75ca04258e14175e32925ba66f93b637","category":"Apple"}
