Lady Gaga’s video for “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6xyaeiV58\">Stupid Love</a>” made a big deal about being shot “entirely on iPhone 11” almost five years ago. Olivia Rodrigo and Selena Gomez have shot music videos on iPhones, and most recently, The Weeknd’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE6XAeZfAsk\">Dancing in the Flames</a>” was shot in cinematic slow-mo on iPhone 16 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But few actually feature the iPhone itself as much as OK Go’s new video for “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MOEULOSVNK4?si=5lPEqEdKjyEXMEgJ\">A Stone Only Rolls Downhill</a>.” You can watch it below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The video features “64 videos on 64 iPhones” and makes use of clever framing, choreography, and edits to tie it all together. Not only were all the videos <em>shot</em> on iPhone, but the iPhones are the star of the video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s difficult to judge exactly which iPhones are in use, but they <em>appear</em> to be iPhone 15 Pro models in bright colorful cases. In a short <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY7hI-mPqr8\">behind the scenes video</a> you can see the phones have action buttons rather than mute switches, but no camera control button. And of course, they all feature a Dynamic Island.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"331f9c53509a7996092be757fffbca2a2044291df19281a21cd775c3fe8393e9","category":"Apple"}
