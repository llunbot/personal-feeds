The Starlight color, which was previously the only colorway to sell for this price, is $50 more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air has a gorgeous Pro-inspired design that’s lighter and thinner than the M1 model with an incredible 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display with skinny bezels, 18 hours of battery life, MagSafe for fast charging, and a 1080p webcam. With 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, it’ll be ready for macOS 14 Sonoma this fall and years of updates to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we called the M2 MacBook Air “wonderfully thin and light with a big beautiful display and killer battery life.” And at this price, it’s a bargain too.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3906ebedab81e2a49489c8b4a28b13b89755cc4baf0602f512275a7d014b97b8","category":"Apple"}
