The new O2 VAM we spotted will be ridden by Israel-Premier Tech’s Simon Clarke.</p>\n<p>The new bike has been given the aero-yet-lightweight treatment with new tube shaping, dropped seatstays and low weight on the BikeRadar scales.</p>\n<h2>Like a Giant TCR?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM.\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Simon Clarke’s Factor O2 VAM.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Factor O2 VAM’s new integrated seat mast means its silhouette is similar to a Giant TCR SL.</p>\n<p>However, it differs in that the Giant TCR has seat stays which meet the seat tube near the seatpost clamp, whereas the new O2 VAM now has dropped seat stays.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The new Factor O2 VAM has an integrated seat mast.\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Factor O2 VAM has an integrated seat mast.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These are often used in order to reduce the weight of a bike, because they do away with the excess material of a seatpost and even the need for a wedge clamp, in some instances.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the new O2 VAM has a thin, tapered top tube, which appears to drop at a slightly more extreme angle than the outgoing O2 VAM, furthering its similarities with the TCR.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM.\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The seat tube has a D-shaped profile.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>However, unlike the Giant TCR, Factor’s new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">climbing bike</a> has all its cables routed internally, which appears to be one of several features intended to improve the bike’s aerodynamics.</p>\n<p>The frame looks to have been designed to reduce aerodynamic drag, with a refined front end and a D-shaped seat tube replacing the round seat tube on the outgoing model.</p>\n<h2>How much does the new Factor O2 VAM weigh?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Scales showing 6.925kg weight of Factor O2 VAM.\" title=\"Factor O2 VAM_GEORGE_3\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Our scales show a weight of 6.925kg for the Factor O2 VAM.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On BikeRadar’s scales, Simon Clarke’s new Factor O2 VAM weighs 6.925kg, which is just over the UCI weight limit of 6.8kg.</p>\n<p>The low weight is in part due to Clarke himself, who is 175cm tall and rides a 52cm frame, which is sure to keep the bike’s overall weight down.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM.\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The seat tube has a UCI sticker.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’re not sure if this bike is completely ready for the Tour de France just yet, but Clarke appears to be running a single <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bottle-cages/\">bottle cage</a>, which will also keep the weight down by a few grams.</p>\n<p>Clarke also has an FSA <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">crankset</a> with carbon crank arms, which will also save weight compared to Shimano’s alloy cranks.</p>\n<h2>New wheels, to boot</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The new Black Inc wheels have a 28mm-deep front rim and a 33mm-deep rear rim.\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Black Inc wheels have a 28mm-deep front rim and a 33mm-deep rear rim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Clarke’s bike is also fitted with a set of new Black Inc wheels.</p>\n<p>Black Inc is Factor’s in-house component brand and, while our team on the ground hasn’t weighed the wheels separately, they will likely be featherweight from the visual cues.</p>\n<p>The carbon <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">road bike wheels</a> have carbon spokes and the front wheel has a shallow 28mm rim and a 33mm-deep rim at the rear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Calipers showing 30.6mm tyre width on Factor O2 VAM.\" title=\"Factor O2 VAM_GEORGE_1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Calipers showing 30.6mm tyre width on the Factor O2 VAM.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The wheels are fitted with 28mm-wide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/continental-grand-prix-5000-s-tr-review/\">Continental GP5000 S TR</a> tyres. Mounted on the Black Inc wheels, the tyres measure up to 30.6mm wide, suggesting a generous internal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">rim width</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">tyres</a> have also been given the permanent marker treatment, with the markings on the tyre wall scribbled out.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Black Inc wheels on Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM.\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tyres have been given the permanent marker treatment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Teams often do this when a product they’re using has not yet been released, or when a component isn’t from one of its sponsors.
