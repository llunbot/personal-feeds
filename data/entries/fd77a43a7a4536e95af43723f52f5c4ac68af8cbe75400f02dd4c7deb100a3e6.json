The idea of spending time on a turbo trainer, self-flagellating yourself to heavy music while you stared numbingly at a wall, all in pursuit of some intangible fitness gains, seemed like a kind of madness.</p>\n<p>However, thanks to the advent of smart turbo trainers and third-party interactive apps, training indoors has never been easier or, crucially, more fun.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to invest in an indoor training setup, then you’re in the right place. We’ve put the latest smart trainers through their paces to find out what’s really worth spending your money on.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Best smart trainers in 2021, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Elite Suito</strong>: £649.99</li>\n<li><strong>Saris H3</strong>: £849.99 / $999.99</li>\n<li><strong>Tacx Neo 2T</strong>: £1,199.99 / $1,399.99 / AU$1,899.99</li>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Kickr</strong>: £999.99 / $1,199.99 / €1,199.99 / AU$1,699.99</li>\n<li><strong>Wahoo Kickr Core</strong>: £699.99 / $899.99 / €799.99 / AU$1,199.99</li>\n<li><strong>BKool Smart Air Lite</strong>: £749.99</li>\n<li><strong>Elite Direto XR:</strong> £824.99 / $949.99 / €849.99 / AU$TBC</li>\n<li><strong>Elite Drivo II</strong>: £999.99 / $1,199 / AU$1,599.99</li>\n<li><strong>Kurt Kinetic R1</strong>: £769 / $949 / €899 / AU$1,699.99</li>\n<li><strong>Saris M2</strong>: £425 / $500</li>\n<li><strong>Tacx Flux S</strong>: £549 / $749 / €599 / AU$1,000</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n<h3>What is a smart trainer?</h3>\n<p>Smart trainers are interactive turbo trainers that connect with apps such as<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/zwift-your-complete-guide/\"> Zwift</a>,<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/training-software/trainerroad-training-software-review/\"> TrainerRoad</a>,<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/training-software/the-sufferfest-training-centre-app-review/\"> The Sufferfest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rgt-cycling-guide/\">RGT Cycling</a> to control the trainer’s resistance and replicate hills, headwinds and drafting effects inside virtual worlds.</p>\n<p>These apps can also guide you through power-based interval workouts with the resistance automatically adjusting to keep you at the required power (known as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/erg-mode/\">ERG mode</a>).</p>\n<p>Today’s smart turbo trainers work by communicating with third-party apps on smartphones, tablets and computers using wireless ANT+ frequencies or Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>It sounds complicated, but most of these trainers and apps will automatically search for and connect to each other, so in practice, it’s usually very simple.</p>\n<h3>Wheel-on or direct drive?</h3>\n<p>There are two main types of smart trainer: <strong>wheel-on</strong> and <strong>direct drive</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Wheel-on smart trainers</strong> function like classic, ‘dumb’ trainers – you clamp the rear axle into a support while your rear wheel rests on a roller drum. This drum is connected to a resistance unit that communicates with your chosen hardware and app to control the resistance you feel through the wheel.</p>\n<p>These are typically the cheapest and lightest types of smart trainers, but they can cause wear on your tyres (though<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/continental-ultrasport-hometrainer-tyre-review/\"> specific trainer tyres</a> are available to mitigate this issue), their power measurement is generally less accurate and the ride feel often isn’t as good as direct-drive trainers.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct drive trainers</strong> require you to remove the rear wheel and connect your bike to the trainer via a standard cassette. These are heavier and more expensive than wheel-on trainers, but prices are getting more competitive and they have a number of advantages.</p>\n<p>Outside of the obvious one, a lack of wear on your lovely rear tyre, they also tend to be quieter and offer a more realistic, road-like ride feel. They are also usually much more feature-rich and accurate, in terms of power measurement, than wheel-on trainers.</p>\n<p>Of course, price is always going to be a major consideration. So we’ve tested a range of options to suit as many budgets as possible, but there’s no denying these trainers aren’t cheap.</p>\n<p>However, compared to a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupset</a> upgrade or even a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes-2019-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">new winter bike</a>, they can offer good value if you want to be able to consistently and enjoyably train indoors.</p>\n<h3>Why should I train indoors rather than just ride outside?</h3>\n<p>This is a fair question and one that really has a very personal answer.</p>\n<p>However, most of us will probably admit that we don’t enjoy getting wet, cold or dirty. Furthermore, if you live in a particularly busy part of the world, training indoors can be much safer – if you’re doing hard intervals to exhaustion or training in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/how-to-nail-your-time-trial-position-like-tony-martin/\">time-trial position</a> out on the open roads, you really need to be careful of traffic.</p>\n<p>Training indoors can save you from all of that, and in a more positive light, training indoors can be extremely time-efficient. Virtual worlds such as Zwift are also so popular now that there are organised online group rides and races – there are even <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/british-cycling-announces-esports-national-championship-for-2019/\">national championships</a> and the UCI <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/zwift-and-uci-esports-cycling-world-championships/\">cycling esports world championships</a> – so you can indulge your competitive urges to make it more fun.</p>\n<h2>Elite Suito</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Elite’s Suito is a simple and user-friendly smart trainer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type: </b>Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 1,900 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 15%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 14.5kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel: </b>3.5kg</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included: </b>Yes</li>\n<li><b>Noise:</b> 73dB</li>\n<li><b>Price: </b>£649.99 / $799 / €669 / AU$999 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Suito is Elite’s new, more competitively priced direct-drive smart trainer. It comes ready to use straight out of the box, so there’s minimal fuss involved in setting it up and getting riding. It’s a great plug-and-play solution.</p>\n<p>It comes with an 11-speed Shimano 105 cassette installed, and there are adaptors for 142mm thru-axles and a front wheel riser block included in the box, all of which is especially noteworthy at this price point.</p>\n<p>Ride quality is very good, especially considering it doesn’t have the largest flywheel out there, and we were impressed by its stability when really cranking things up.</p>\n<p>It can simulate gradients of up to 15 per cent and has a maximum power of 1,900 watts, so really strong riders might find this unit a little under-specced, but for most people, this will be more than they’ll ever need.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/elite-suito-review/\">Read our full review of the Elite Suito</a></li>\n<li>Available on Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07X64YMXF?tag=bikrad-21&amp;ascsubtag=bikeradar-0\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Saris H3</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Saris H3 tops the brand’s range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type: </b>Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 2,000 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 20%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 21.3kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel: </b>9kg</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> No</li>\n<li><b>Noise: </b>61dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £849.99 / $999.99 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The H3 sits at the top of Saris’s smart trainer range and builds on the popular H2. Reducing the noise levels was one of Saris’s top priorities and it’s certainly achieved good things with the H3 – at just 61dB at 20mph (measured on an iPhone app), it’s very quiet indeed.</p>\n<p>Ride feel is good, with the stout 9kg flywheel contributing to a very realistic experience. At 21.3kg, it’s also a very solid platform, and while this does make it quite hard to move around, Saris has at least included a handle in the design, which makes things considerably easier.</p>\n<p>The H3 is capable of 2,000 watts of power and 20 per cent gradients. Power figures were within the claimed +/- 2 per cent accuracy, which should be more than enough for most riders. At £849.99 it’s also competitively priced, so there’s a lot to like.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/saris-h3-review/\">Read our full review of the Saris H3</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Tacx Neo 2T</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tacx Neo 2T smart trainer is its top of the range model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type:</b> Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 2,200 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 25%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 21.5kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel weight:</b> Virtual</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> No</li>\n<li><b>Noise:</b> 61dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £1,199.99 / $1,399.99 / AU$1,899.99 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Neo 2T is Tacx’s top of the range smart trainer, and it’s priced accordingly. It looks like a spaceship and its spec and performance are pretty futuristic.</p>\n<p>The Neo 2T uses an arrangement of magnets to create a virtual flywheel, and this offers fantastic ride feel, along with the ability to change the level of inertia depending on the virtual terrain. Tacx also claims the Neo 2T power measurement is accurate to +/- 1 per cent, which is up there with the best.</p>\n<p>At this price, it’s a little disappointing that a cassette isn’t included, but that’s only a minor nitpick. Overall, the Neo 2T is about as good as it gets in terms of performance.</p>\n<p>When you consider that it can be used without a power source (making it useful for pre-race warm-ups) and that it’s also one of the quietest trainers available, you have a very compelling package. The only real problem is whether you can afford it or not.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/tacx-neo-2t-smart-review/\">Read our full review of the Tacx Neo 2T</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Wahoo Kickr Smart (2020)</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ride feel of the Wahoo Kickr smart trainer 2020 is fantastic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type:</b> Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 2,200 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 20%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 21.5kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel:</b> 7.25kg</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> Yes</li>\n<li><b>Noise:</b> 61dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £999.99 / $1,199.99 / €1,199.99 / AU$1,699.99 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Kickr is Wahoo’s top of the range model. It offers a fantastic ride feel, thanks to its relatively large 7.25kg flywheel, and it’s also wonderfully quiet.</p>\n<p>Setting the unit up is very easy, with Wahoo including a cassette and a generously sized power cable, so you shouldn’t need extension leads. Once the bike’s installed, it offers a very solid platform for sprints up to 2,200 watts and gradients up to 20 per cent – these aren’t the highest maximums, but they should be plenty for most of us.</p>\n<p>Power accuracy has increased over <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-smart-trainer-2020-review/\">the 2019 version</a>, up from +/- 2 per cent for the previous model to just +/- 1 per cent, and the trainer is now able to automatically calibrate itself without a traditional spin down.</p>\n<p>Wahoo also amended the trainer’s supporting feet over the previous design too, to allow for five degrees of lateral tilt and help give a more realistic ride feel.</p>\n<p>The Kickr doesn’t have any absurd headline features or specs, and it doesn’t come cheap, but it does everything brilliantly and without fuss.

Not only is it capable of simulating gradients up to 24 per cent, but it can handle a staggering 3,600 watts maximum power at 60kph at a claimed accuracy of +/- 0.5 per cent!</p>\n<p>Fortunately, it’s a bulky, stable platform, so if you’re the type of rider that can get anywhere near those numbers, you won’t have any issues, but we do have to question if any such riders actually exist in the real world.</p>\n<p>In use, the Drivo II is great. The ride feel is impressive and it reacts very quickly to changes in incline, thanks to an electromagnet on the 6kg flywheel.</p>\n<p>Though its bulk comes in useful when laying down the power, it’s a bit of a hindrance when it comes to storing the unit. Furthermore, it faces stiff competition in this price bracket and though it’s able to offer accuracy and maximum power figures wildly beyond anything else, it’s not clear exactly who would benefit from that extra headroom.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/elite-drivo-ii-review/\">Read our full review of the Elite Drivo II</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Kurt Kinetic R1</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Kinetic R1 has a different design that allows for some side to side movement.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type:</b> Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power: </b>2,000</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 20%</li>\n<li><b>Weight: </b>21.5kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel: </b>6.3kg</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> No</li>\n<li><b>Noise:</b> 75dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £769 / $949 / €899 / AU$1,699.99 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Kurt Kinetic R1’s unique selling point is the ‘rock and roll’ design, which allows a significant range of side-to-side motion.

The resistance changes smoothly to match changes in the virtual terrain, and with a 2,000 watts and 20 per cent gradient ceiling, it ought to satisfy most people’s requirements.</p>\n<p>It’s not the quietest trainer at 75dB, but it’s not noticeably loud either. Ultimately, whether this is the right trainer for you will depend on how you feel about the rock and roll design – if you want that unique ride feel, the Kinetic R1 is a great unit.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/kurt-kinetic-r1-direct-drive-review/\">Read our full review of the Kurt Kinetic R1</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Saris M2</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Saris’s M2 smart turbo trainer is a good value option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type:</b> Wheel-on</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 1,500 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient: </b>15%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 9kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel: </b>1.2kg</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> Not needed</li>\n<li><b>Noise: </b>75dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £425 / $500 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Saris M2 is a relatively affordable, wheel-on smart turbo trainer.

This won’t be a problem if you have a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/tips-for-building-the-ideal-indoor-training-space/\">pain cave</a>, but if you need to be able to easily stow it away, this might be a dealbreaker.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/tacx-flux-s-smart-trainer-review/\">Read our full review of the Tacx Flux S</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>What to look for when buying a smart trainer</h3>\n<h4>How did we test?</h4>\n<p>When testing these units, we first considered the price of each trainer and what is included in the box — adding on things such as cassettes, spacers or adaptors can add a premium and are worth factoring in.</p>\n<p>We then considered how easy it was to set up the trainer, and how easily it paired with Zwift.</p>\n<p>Next, we tested the ride quality on Zwift to see what the trainer felt like at a constant power, as well as when accelerating, climbing and sprinting out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>This looked at both the physical stability and how the trainer reacted to Zwift, including changes in terrain and changes in power. These power results were compared with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/garmin-vector-3-power-meter-review/\">Garmin Vector power meter pedals</a>.</p>\n<h4>Flywheel</h4>\n<p>A flywheel helps to create a road-like feel due to the kinetic energy they’re able to store, and the resultant inertia they give – essentially, when you stop pedalling it should feel like you are coasting on a real road.</p>\n<p>It’s generally considered that the heavier the flywheel, the better the ride feel ought to be, but this isn’t always the case. Construction, materials and design all play a role, and some brands are in fact now using virtual flywheels with magnets.</p>\n<p>Though more expensive, virtual flywheels have the advantage of being able to change the level of inertia depending on the virtual terrain – so climbing should feel different to riding on the flat, just like in the real world.</p>\n<h4>Weight and packability</h4>\n<p>Trainers come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and weights. Wheel-on trainers are, more often than not, the lightest and most packable kind of trainer.</p>\n<p>Direct-drive trainers tend to be much, much bulkier. Though size and shape can vary wildly – with some models folding up to a very slim form – they tend to all be pretty heavy regardless.</p>\n<p>If you’ve got a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/tips-for-building-the-ideal-indoor-training-space/\">pain cave</a>, it may not matter at all how big and heavy your trainer is. But if you have to set it up and pack it down before and after every session, then you’ll need to take this into consideration, especially if you have cyclists’ arms.</p>\n<h4>Power and gradient</h4>\n<p>Trainers have different maximum power figures that correspond to the amount of resistance they’re able to generate. They range from 1,500 watts to over 3,500 watts, but 1,500 watts should be plenty for most people, and 2,000-watt models ought to be enough for practically everyone except professional sprinters.</p>\n<p>The gradient figures relate to the maximum incline a trainer can simulate – given in per cent, like on the road. Again, a lower figure isn’t going to hinder your training, it simply means those trainers won’t be able to simulate the virtual world perfectly whenever the gradients go beyond what the trainer is capable of.</p>\n<h4>Noise</h4>\n<p>Trainers used to be notoriously noisy, but there have been vast improvements made over the past few years. On-wheel trainers are still typically louder than direct-drive trainers, but the gap has narrowed considerably.</p>\n<p>The quietest trainers are direct-drive though, with some models being so quiet that the sound from your drivetrain becomes the main source of noise.</p>\n<p>If you want to be able to train inside your house or flat early in the morning, perhaps before your partner/family/housemates wake up, or after work when they’re trying to watch their favourite series in the next room, a quiet trainer is a must.</p>\n<h4>Useful accessories</h4>\n<p>First of all, most smart trainers need to be plugged into the mains electricity supply in order to function properly. A good quality extension lead might therefore be necessary, depending on where you’re going to set up the trainer because the supplied plugs don’t always have super-long wires.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bluetooth-i-apologize/\">We recommend using Bluetooth</a> to connect all of your hardware together, but if you have ANT+ accessories (such as an older power meter or a heart rate monitor) that you also want to connect, then you’ll need an ANT+ dongle for your laptop or tablet.</p>\n<p>You might need a riser block for your front wheel. Whether you do or not depends on each model of trainer, but it’s worth checking because those that need one to level you out don’t always come with one included.</p>\n<p>They’re not essential, and you could theoretically use a yellow pages (if those still exist) or a bit of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber#Dimensional_lumber\"> 2×4</a> to level things out, but a dedicated riser block will work better and they’re not that expensive (unless you want it to be, in which case Wahoo will sell you its<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-climb-first-ride-review/\"> Kickr Climb</a> gradient simulator).</p>\n<p>A trainer mat of some sort – preferably one that’s rubberised – will help catch your sweat and will also help damp vibrations and keep noise levels down, especially if you’re using your trainer on a wooden floor (which tends to amplify the sounds).</p>\n<p>Sweat nets that cover your top tube, steerer tube and stem might also be a good investment to protect them from perspiration and corrosion, but what you really want is a big, powerful fan. Something around 20 inches will do, or if you’re really flash you can get a ‘smart’ fan such as the<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-launches-cheaper-kickr-plus-trainer-controlled-fan/\"> Wahoo Kickr Headwind</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a laptop or a tablet then a specific stand to hold it in front of you is very useful as well, or if you want to use a TV, the Apple TV box is able to use the Zwift app.</p>","author":"Simon Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"fd77a43a7a4536e95af43723f52f5c4ac68af8cbe75400f02dd4c7deb100a3e6","category":"Cycling"}
