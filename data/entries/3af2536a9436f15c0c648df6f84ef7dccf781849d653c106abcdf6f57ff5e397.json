Many of the injured appear to be Hezbollah members, although a young girl is said to be among the dead.</p>\n<p>New York Times reporters <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/world/israel-hamas-war-news\">captured the chaos</a> of the striking scene in two anecdotes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ahmad Ayoud, a butcher from the Basta neighborhood in Beirut, said he was in his shop when he heard explosions. Then he saw a man in his 20s fall off a motorbike. He appeared to be bleeding. “We all thought he got wounded from random shooting,” Ayoud said. “Then a few minutes later we started hearing of other cases. All were carrying pagers.”</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs, where many of the explosions took place, reported seeing smoke coming from people’s pockets followed by a blast like a firework. Mohammed Awada, 52, was driving alongside one of the victims. “My son went crazy and started to scream when he saw the man’s hand flying away from him,” he said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Video from the region already shows a device exploding in a supermarket checkout line, and pictures show numerous young men lying on the ground with large, bloody wounds on their upper legs and thighs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050337#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050337&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3af2536a9436f15c0c648df6f84ef7dccf781849d653c106abcdf6f57ff5e397","category":"Tech"}
