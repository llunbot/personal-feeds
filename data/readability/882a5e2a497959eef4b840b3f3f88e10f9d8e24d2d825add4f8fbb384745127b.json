When it comes to tray style hitch racks with uprights for both tires (aka 1up style), releasing the uprights with two hands while also trying to hold onto the bike can be a pain. To make a similar style rack that is easier to use, Kuat invented a OneTap Hydro-pneumatic tire arm which releases from the tire with one touch, automatically. That means your other hand is free to hold the bike as you press the OneTap levers which releases the bike.</p><p>Those OneTap Hydro-Pneumatic pistons are coated with Genuine Kashima Coat via an exclusive contract with Miyaki Co., for long term durability. You’ll also find Igus bushings at key pivots, “custom formulated Tiger Powder coating”, stainless steel hardware, and an “automotive grade 750-hour salt spray” on steel hardware for increased longevity.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9.jpg\" alt=\"Kuat Piston Pro X Hitch Rack wheel adjusters\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10112328/Kuat-Piston-Pro-X-bike-rack-hitch-with-lights-kashima-9-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Don’t want to have to carry around tools to change your tire size?
