{"title":"Sonos Canned CEO Patrick Spence, Who Spearheaded Disastrous App Launch","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342179/sonos-ceo-patrick-spence-resignation-reason-app","date":1736810971000,"content":"\n<p>Chris Welch, The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is resigning from the job today,\neffective immediately, with board member Tom Conrad filling the\nrole of interim CEO. It’s the most dramatic development yet in an\neight-month saga that has proven to be the most challenging time\nin Sonos’ history.</p>\n\n<p>The company’s decision to prematurely release a buggy, completely\noverhauled new app <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137502/sonos-new-app-announced\">back in May</a> — with crucial features\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151704/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-missing-features\">missing at launch</a> — outraged customers and kicked off a\nmonthslong domino effect that included <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220357/sonos-layoffs-august-2024-app\">layoffs</a>, a sharp\ndecline in employee morale, and a public apology tour. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24169086/sonos-ace-headphones-review\">Sonos\nAce headphones</a>, rumored to be the whole reason behind the\nhurried app, were immediately overshadowed by the controversy, and\nmy sources tell me that sales numbers remain dismal. Sonos’\ncommunity forums and subreddit have been dominated by complaints\nand an overwhelmingly negative sentiment since the spring. [...]</p>\n\n<p>But three months later, Sonos’ board of directors and Spence\nhave concluded that those steps weren’t enough: the app debacle\nhas officially cost Spence his job. No other changes are being\nmade today, however. So for now, chief product officer Maxime\nBouvat-Merlin, who some employees have privately told me\ndeserves a fair share of the blame for recent missteps, will\nremain in his role.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they don’t fire that rube too, Sonos is likely continuing down the path to irrelevance and bankruptcy that Spence started them down. The problem wasn’t a bad or ill-considered app rewrite. The bad app rewrite was a symptom of leadership with no appreciation for product and experience design, when Sonos’s entire <em>raison d’être</em> is to deliver a superior product and acoustic experience. Their customer demographic is people with great taste and high standards. Sonos is basically Apple, but just for audio, but in a market where Apple itself is a major player. Yet somehow the company wound up being run by a leadership team with no taste.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a surprise tidbit that gives me hope Conrad might be the right man for the job:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Conrad’s career includes a 10-year tenure as chief technology\nofficer at Pandora and two years as VP of product at Snapchat. He\nworked on Apple’s Finder software during the ’90s. Most recently,\nConrad served as chief product officer for the ill-fated Quibi\nstreaming service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(To be clear, I’m talking about the ’90s Finder part, not the Quibi part. The classic Finder was one of the all-time best apps ever made.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/13/sonos-canned-ceo\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"82b43536e2597034608135af1136cd1f23d66a8cd4fa06e3e85aa410fcf582fe","category":"Tech"}
