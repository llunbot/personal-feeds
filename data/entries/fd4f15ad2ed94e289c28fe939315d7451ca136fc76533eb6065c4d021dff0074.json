The company claims the models outperform other video-synthesis models when evaluated by humans, pushing us closer to a future where anyone can synthesize a full video of any subject on demand.</p>\n<p>The company does not yet have plans of when or how it will release these capabilities to the public, but Meta says Movie Gen is a tool that may allow people to \"enhance their inherent creativity\" rather than replace human artists and animators. The company envisions future applications such as easily creating and editing \"day in the life\" videos for social media platforms or generating personalized animated birthday greetings.</p>\n<p>Movie Gen builds on Meta's previous work in video synthesis, following 2022's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/write-text-get-video-meta-announces-ai-video-generator/\">Make-A-Scene</a> video generator and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/metas-new-ai-image-generator-was-trained-on-1-1-billion-instagram-and-facebook-photos/\">Emu</a> image-synthesis model. Using text prompts for guidance, this latest system can generate custom videos with sounds for the first time, edit and insert changes into existing videos, and transform images of people into realistic personalized videos.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/metas-new-movie-gen-ai-system-can-deepfake-video-from-a-single-photo/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/metas-new-movie-gen-ai-system-can-deepfake-video-from-a-single-photo/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd4f15ad2ed94e289c28fe939315d7451ca136fc76533eb6065c4d021dff0074","category":"Tech"}
