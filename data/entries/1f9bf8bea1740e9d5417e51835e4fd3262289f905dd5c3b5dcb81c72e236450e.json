Multiview allows viewers to stream up to four games at the same time on a single screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewers can customize multiview by selecting games at the bottom of the screen, and then selecting a layout that displays either one prominent display and up to three adjacent, or a split-screen view. Switching back to single-screen mode can be done with just a click. Apple also offers audio adjustments, such as switching the home and away feeds for baseball games. It’s not clear whether Apple will open the feature up to third-party apps, but perhaps we’ll learn more at WWDC, which kicks off June 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiview requires an Apple TV 4K and tvOS 16.5. The update should install automatically, but a manual installation can be done by going to Settings &gt; <em>System</em> &gt; <em>Software Updates</em> &gt; <em>Update Software</em>. Then click on <em>Download and Install</em> to download the update, and then click on <em>Update Now</em> to perform the installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1382408/mls-season-pass-subscription-apple-tv-plus.html\">MLS Season Pass</a> is a subscription service within Apple TV that’s $14.99 per month or $99 per season, or $12.99/$79 if you subscribe to Apple TV+. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/630083/apple-tv-plus-how-to-watch-mlb-games.html\">Friday Night Baseball</a>, which broadcasts two MB games on Friday nights with no blackout restriction, is included with all Apple TV+ subscriptions.</p>\n\nApple TV, Streaming Devices, Streaming Media</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1f9bf8bea1740e9d5417e51835e4fd3262289f905dd5c3b5dcb81c72e236450e","category":"Apple"}
