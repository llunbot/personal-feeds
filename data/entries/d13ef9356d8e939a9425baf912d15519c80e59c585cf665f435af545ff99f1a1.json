But Framework likes to release its updates in batches, and this one also comes with a few designed to make the Laptop 13 a better system for Linux enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>One of those changes is a redesigned keyboard, which is exactly like the older Framework Laptop 13 keyboard, except it has a Super key instead of a Windows logo on it. The second is a higher-resolution display upgrade, specifically chosen because it looks better in 200 percent scaling mode than the old screen; Linux still has problems with \"fractional\" scaling modes like 125 percent and 150 percent, which was what the old Framework screen usually looked best at.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042317#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042317&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d13ef9356d8e939a9425baf912d15519c80e59c585cf665f435af545ff99f1a1","category":"Tech"}
