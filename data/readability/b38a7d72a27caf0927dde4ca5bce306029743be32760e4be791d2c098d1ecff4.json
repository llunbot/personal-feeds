{"title":"Rapha and Baum Cycles partner on limited-release titanium bikes","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/rapha-and-baum-cycles-partner-on-limited-release-titanium-bikes/","date":1630656129000,"content":"<div><div><p>Every cyclist has their own preferences, but when it comes to bespoke bicycles, one brand stands apart. Based in Geelong, Australia, Baum Cycles has been making personalised frames by hand for over 30 years.</p><p>Born of a shared passion for the sport, Rapha’s relationship with Baum dates back over a decade and several special edition frames. For many years, Darren Baum – Baum Cycles Founder and Manager Director, and Simon Mottram – Rapha founder and CEO – have joined hundreds of local RCC members to watch the defining Tour Down Under stage on Willunga Hill.</p><p>Now, the Rapha Cycling Club is delighted to team up with Baum Cycles once again to create something extra special for RCC members: a special edition version of Baum’s next generation all-rounder road bike, the Orbis. As well as the Club’s signature stripes, every frame will feature a local Chapter icon on the top tube and a personalised RCC number etched into the chainstay.</p><p>Only 100 frames will be made and RCC members will have the choice of two frame options. 75 framesets will be available via the ReadyMade service, which offers significant personalisation of seven standard frame sizes. And for members in search of individualised ride characteristics and handling, a further 25 framesets will be available through the Tailored service – a nod to the 25 years Baum has commercially been making bespoke bikes.</p><p>Under the hood(s) the bike is equipped with Shimano’s latest Dura Ace groupset. The Shimano Dura Ace WH- R9270 wheelset offers the opportunity for further customisation with a choice of three rim depths to suit various terrains.</p><p>Meanwhile the cockpit is composed of lightweight components from ENVE, who provides the handlebar, stem and seatpost. Topping it all, there’s a choice of saddles from Pro and high grip bar tape from Silca.</p><p>Mechanically minded from an early age, Darren started building bikes in his teens and hasn’t looked back. At the helm of Baum Cycles, he now has over 30 years experience handcrafting bespoke bicycles. And though they don’t consider themselves to be industry leaders, they never follow either.<br>At Baum, they ride their own race. Each frame they build becomes a shared passion project that begins with an in-depth consultation. And since everything from frame geometry and componentry to the colour scheme can be fully personalised, there’s plenty to talk about.</p><p><em>“Every person that turns up to talk to us comes for a very different reason,”</em> says Darren Baum, Baum Cycles Founder and Managing Director. <em>“It’s up to us to work out why they’ve come. Do they want something that’s handmade? Are they experiencing pain and need a bike that really fits them? Or do they just really like a particular colour? Whatever their reason for coming to us, it’s our job to create the bike of their dreams that’ll last a lifetime.”</em></p><p>Simon Mottram, Rapha Founder and CEO: <em>“I’ve known Darren for many years, since my earliest trips to Australia. His relentless pursuit of perfection in bike design and custom bike manufacturing has been remarkable and I’ve been fortunate to ride his wonderful titanium machines in the past. Rapha and Baum have worked together many times over the years and it has always been a very natural partnership – as it feels for a Baum customer and their bike. So it’s no surprise that this is the most beautiful RCC bike we have offered yet. “</em></p><p>More information can be found at: <a href=\"http://baumcycles.com/rapha-special\" target=\"_blank\">baumcycles.com/rapha-special</a></p><h2>Key Details</h2><ul><li>READYMADE This is the fastest way to get your new bike, ReadyMade frames are available in four standard frame sizes (50-56cm) with three more (48, 58 and 60cm) to follow soon.
