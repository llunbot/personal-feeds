Imagery from commercial satellites captured over the weekend suggest the missile exploded before or during launch.</p>\n<p>This is at least the second time an RS-28 Sarmat missile has failed in less than two years, dealing a blow to the country's nuclear forces days after the head of the Russian legislature issued a veiled threat to use the missile against Europe if Western allies approved Ukraine's use of long-range weapons against Russia.</p>\n<p>Commercial satellite imagery collected by Maxar and Planet show before-and-after views of the Sarmat missile silo at Plesetsk, a military base about 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of Moscow. The view from one of Maxar's imaging satellites Saturday revealed unmistakable damage at the launch site, with a large crater centered on the opening to the underground silo.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051740#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051740&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"696e548cfbd83a6997f4015fc94386a686b4947d0c1a28c12a8e99c8c1bf0754","category":"Tech"}
