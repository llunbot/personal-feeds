The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>Apple has until March 6 to comply with the Digital Markets Act, in order to avoid fines, so iOS 17.4 will likely be released on or before that date.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the changes in the EU, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/\">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, a new iMessage security protocol, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number.
