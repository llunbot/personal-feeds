The newest road and gravel (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-roval-control-world-cup-wheelset-air-trak-xc-tire/\">and XC</a>) lineup additions are claiming some serious gains, like a “race only” RapidAir TLR road tire that is 33 seconds faster (over 40km) than the previous model. Or if gravel is your flavor, how about an updated Pathfinder tread that is 19% faster and 14% more cut-resistant? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-compound--jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-compound--jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-compound--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-compound--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-compound--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-compound--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-compound--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The updated casing and construction are key to the speed of the new Specialized road tires.

The treads have been tweaked slightly, but you’ll know the model quickly if you’re a fan (as I’ve been). The treads start on the smooth and fast side with the updated Pathfinder. A hallmark in the gravel race scene, a no-nonsense tire, business in the middle, party on the sides. The next is the Tracer. Once one of my favorite cyclocross treads, it now has a fast do-it-all gravel design, much like the updated Crux. The center line is still tightly spaced blocks but has an updated height and profile. Last is the Terra, a full-on cross-country design that should be at the most rocky and technical gravel terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-mold--jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-mold--jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-mold--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-mold--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-mold--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-mold--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-mold--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All the tires now come in their various configurations, so don’t expect to be 35-50mm on each tread. One thing is sure: Specialized trimming of the fat from the tire lines makes it <em>(slightly)</em> easier to pick a tire for specific conditions on race day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Road:gravel tires pathfinder logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-logo--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Pathfinder TLR – The Fastest Gravel Tire, Now Faster</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pathfinder TLR is already the most decorated gravel tire in the game, but Specialized found a way to make it 19% faster while also 14% more cut-resistant. This updated version keeps its signature smooth-rolling center strip but now with bigger GRIPTON T5 side knobs for more bite in the corners. Oh, and it is available in tan sidewall as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--scaled.webp\" alt=\"specialized pathfinder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pathfinder--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tread Updates:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New tread design for stability &amp; grip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GRIPTON T2 fast-rolling center tread</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GRIPTON T5 high-traction edge knobs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Road:gravel tires pathfinder 40mm wei\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-pathfinder-40mm-weight--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 380g (700×35), with 700×40 (452g) and 700×45 options for more volume and control</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>$55</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Road:gravel tires tracer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Roadgravel-tires-tracer--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tracer TLR – Mixed Terrain Confidence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re the type to mix pavement, dirt, and chunky gravel into one ride, the Tracer TLR is your new best friend.
