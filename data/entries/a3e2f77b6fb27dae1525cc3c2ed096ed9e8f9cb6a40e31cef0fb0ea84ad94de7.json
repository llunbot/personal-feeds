This guide helps you to understand the differences between the two models and decide which is best for you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPad-11-vs-2024-iPad-Air-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe 11th-generation ‌iPad‌ is positioned as an entry-level model with essential features for basic use, while the ‌iPad Air‌ is for users who need more from their tablet, such as students, creatives, or anyone who wants a future-proof device with newer, more advanced features.

If your typical day includes browsing Safari, watching YouTube or Netflix, reading articles, messaging friends, and maybe doing some basic schoolwork or light gaming, the 11th-gen ‌iPad‌ has more than enough power and suitable features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe A16 chip is still very capable, and the device still has ‌Apple Pencil‌ support for casual note-taking or drawing. However, the display is not laminated, which means there's a slight air gap between the glass and the screen content—something most users won't notice unless they're drawing or writing precisely. The entry-level ‌iPad‌ also lacks the anti-reflective coating, so it can be more reflective in bright lighting, as well as wide color support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's a great choice for students or casual users who don't need advanced multitasking features or professional apps. The starting price of $349 makes it especially appealing for families, kids, or those upgrading from an older ‌iPad‌. For many users, the extra $250 to buy the ‌iPad Air‌ is not justified.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the other hand, the ‌iPad Air‌ is for users who want noticeably more performance and versatility. Its M3 chip is noticeably faster and supports things the A16 doesn't, such as hardware-accelerated ray tracing and ProRes video encoding/decoding. That makes it far more suitable for video editing, high-end gaming, working with large documents, running creative apps like Affinity Photo or Logic Pro, or even writing code. It also supports ‌Apple Intelligence‌, so if you want the latest AI features such as writing tools or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a>, as well as anything Apple brings to ‌Apple Intelligence‌ in the future, the Air is the better choice.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe display is fully laminated, which eliminates the gap between your ‌Apple Pencil‌ and the screen, making writing and drawing feel more natural—especially important if you're using ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro, which also brings extra features like barrel roll and haptic feedback. The 13-inch model offers significantly more screen real estate for multitasking, side-by-side apps, or content creation. It also supports ‌Stage Manager‌, allowing true multi-window multitasking with resizable windows and external display support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're planning to use the ‌iPad‌ for productivity tasks or want something that feels more like a laptop alternative, the ‌iPad Air‌ is likely the better choice. Its starting price is $599 (or $799 for the 13-inch), so it is a more substantial investment—but one that makes sense for users who will take advantage of its more advanced capabilities.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-11-vs-ipad-air/\">iPad 11 vs. iPad Air Buyer's Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-11-vs-ipad-air-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2455006/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3e2f77b6fb27dae1525cc3c2ed096ed9e8f9cb6a40e31cef0fb0ea84ad94de7","category":"Apple"}
