Electric motors can respond faster than the revviest naturally aspirated engines this side of a mid-2000s Formula 1 engine, and with more immediate torque than the mightiest of turbochargers. They are the way forward, for performance as well as energy efficiency. Such is apparent after spending some time behind the wheel of a $128,000 Audi RS7 Performance after a diet of mostly EV performance cars.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the RS7 was the Audi to go for if you wanted something with more than two doors, because the R8 doesn't work with your lifestyle.
