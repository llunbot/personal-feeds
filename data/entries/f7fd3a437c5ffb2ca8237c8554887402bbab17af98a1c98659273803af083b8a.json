For others, especially if you have a HERO10 or HERO11, it’s exciting to see what they can do in the same package, but a less urgent upgrade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two welcome additions are Bluetooth compatibility and TimeSync. Pair earbuds (like AirPods, of course) to add clear narration and voice control the cameras. Or synchronize multiple cameras to make post-production syncing extremely easy. Simply point the cameras at a QR code on their Quik app and they’ll sync their timestamps. Very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, it’s mostly refinements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Better power management delivers longer run times (up to 90 mins in 5.3K30 or 2.5+ hours in 1080p30)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upgraded HDR processing for photo and video</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5.3K60, 4K120 and 2.7K240 resolutions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>156º FOV standard, new Max Lens Mod 2 extends that to 177º</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10-Bit color with GP Log/LUT support for advanced color correction in post</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HyperSmooth 6.0</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need the 1720mAh Enduro battery to get the extended run times, which are nearly <em>double</em> from the HERO11, but it comes with it. It’s the same form factor, so all prior HERO10/11 Media Mods will fit on it, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maximum image size, minimum cropping</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison.jpg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"722\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"GoPro hero12 field of view comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison-297x168.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison-800x451.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison-768x433.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-FOV-comparison-400x225.jpg 400w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 is a big upgrade in that it now automatically adjusts how much it crops your footage. The goal is still to have the ultimate stabilization. But now it can zoom out a bit if it senses a less turbulent environment, giving you a wider FOV when possible. And 360º Horizon Lock is now on by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It keeps the same 8:7 sensor and can now shoot full frame, letting you crop it however you like. That’s enough for great horizontal and vertical footage (for Stories, Reels, etc.), and with the Max Lens Mod, it’s getting nearly everything that’s in front of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mounts, Accessories &amp; Pricing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-accessories.jpg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-accessories.jpg\" alt=\"GoPro hero12 accessories\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-accessories.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-accessories-297x159.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-accessories-800x429.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-accessories-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gopro-hero12-action-cam-accessories-768x412.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the stealthiest updates adds a 1/4-20 threaded mount to their Folding Fingers mount on the bottom. Word is you can buy that separately to fit onto prior models, too. Also very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $399, with bundles starting at $449 and up. Interestingly, there’s no discount for adding the GoPro Subscription. Nor is it bundled into the price like before, but it’s offered for 1/2 off at checkout with camera purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12501-131878-218522?website=327165&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fcameras%2Fhero12-black%2FCHDHX-121-master.html\" target=\"_blank\">GoPro.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gopro-hero12-goes-more-pro-with-key-refinements/\">GoPro HERO12 Goes (More) Pro with Key Refinements</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f7fd3a437c5ffb2ca8237c8554887402bbab17af98a1c98659273803af083b8a","category":"Cycling"}
