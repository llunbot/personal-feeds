Well, if your pockets are deep enough that is now a possibility courtesy of MatchWornShirt’s new Own The Ride scheme – a platform that normally specialises in authenticated, collectible kit from football and other sports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During two week-long December auctions, MatchWornShirt will sell off a selection of 87 road, time-trial and mountain bikes from teams including Visma-Lease A Bike, Ineos Grenadiers, Soudal-QuickStep, EF Education-EasyPost, DSM-Firmenich-PostNL and Lotto-Dstny. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first auction runs from 6th to 14th December, with Christophe Laporte’s Cervélo S5 leading the way at the time of writing, with a high bid of $9,626. The second set of auctions runs from 15th to 22nd December. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first week of auctions is Grand Tour week, with all of the 54 bikes having been raced in one or more of the 2024 Grand Tours. Week two is slightly less <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alpe-d-huez-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Alpe d’Huez</a> and more Els Àngels, featuring bikes that have been used in training and other forms of racing – including mountain bikes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other luminaries whose well-worn saddles are going under the hammer are Jonas Vingegaard, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tom-pidcock-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a>, Charlotte Kool, Remco Evenepoel, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/geraint-thomas-interview-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Geraint Thomas</a>, Wout van Aert, Fabio Jakobson, Egan Bernal and Ben Healy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of brands, that means you can cast your eye over pro-level stock from Cervélo, Cannondale, Pinarello, Specialized, Scott and Orbea.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s a race-winning bike you’re after, Pidcock’s Amstel Gold 2024 bike is for sale, as is Charlotte Kool’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes 2024</a> bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep an eye on the small print, however. Power meters have been removed from many of the bikes and groupset chargers aren’t always included. If you’d rather not collect your new bike, shipping starts at around €450 for European countries and no warranty is provided by the team selling the bike. And you can guarantee a warm cosy feeling knowing that your winning bid is going straight back into the team’s budget for next season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information at <a href=\"https://www.matchwornshirt.com/category/own-the-ride\" target=\"_blank\">MatchWornShirt</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-q36-5-pros-cons\">What are the pros and cons of Tom Pidcock’s move to Q36.5?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/womens-transfers-winners-and-losers\">Rating every women’s WorldTour team’s 2024/25 transfer window</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-50-best-mens-road-cyclists-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 50 best men’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\">The top 50 women’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\">Tadej Pogačar interview: Light is the crown</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/own-the-ride-auction\">Race-ridden bikes from Jonas Vingegaard, Tom Pidcock, Matteo Jorgenson and more go up for auction</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bac537c4098d9bd9ab60a8d30a6606b4f0654b307c35e218e48dbfc81b24ef14","category":"Cycling"}
