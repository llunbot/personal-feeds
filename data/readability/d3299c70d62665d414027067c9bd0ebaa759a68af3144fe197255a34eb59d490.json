Set to debut under their Sport Vlaanderen-Balois riders today as the Six Days of Ghent track racing kicks off, the new 77mm deep wheels are quite a bit wider than what we normally see on the velodrome, pairing a more modern approach to aerodynamics with track tubulars for better versatility across race disciplines.</p><h2>FFWD RYOT 77 Track wider tubular race wheels</h2><div id=\"attachment_278534\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-278534\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD RYOT 77 Track wider tubular race wheels, complete bike\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105323/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_complete-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-278534\">c.

Track racing hasn’t gone as big as road, but they are still often racing 23mm tubulars for decreased rolling resistance instead of the 19mm sew-ups of old. So it was time the rims got updated as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD RYOT 77 Track wider tubular race wheels, dark\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16105316/FFWD-RYOT-77-Track-wider-tubular-race-wheels_dark-wheel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Now featuring a curved tubular rim bed optimized for 21-26mm track tubular, the rim remains wider overall than the tire for better laminar airflow and decreased drag.
