The company’s current robovac, the </span><a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/robot\"><span>Dyson 360 Eye</span></a><span>, is out of stock in the US right now. But recent </span><a href=\"https://fccid.io/QVHRB03001\"><span>FCC filings</span></a> <span>show that the company is working on a potential new product to help address the demand for mechanical housekeepers.</span></p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/robovac-2.jpg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Dyson's potential \"360 Hyperdymium\" unit.

Hyperdymium refers to a proprietary motor technology that can “run at speeds of up to 125,000 revolutions per minute,” according to </span><a href=\"https://www.dyson.co.uk/vacuum-cleaners/sticks/dyson-hyperdymium-motor\"><span>Dyson</span></a><span>. Dyson also says the tech allows it to make lightweight vacuums. The “360” part suggests that the robot will follow in the 360 Eye’s rolling brush-steps by carrying a 360-degree vision system. The 360 Eye has a small camera on top and sensors on the sides. </span></p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/robovac-4.jpg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Dyson's next robovac will likely have 360-degree vision.

As noted by The Verge, this device differs from the 360 Eye and the more recently launched 360 Heurist, which are both taller and slimmer in order to navigate around tight corners and furniture. Pictures submitted also show a light ring, which could help the robot clean up at night. </span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800447#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800447&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7ae5a69ea6497d3a0bc89bddcb33942694d03ed28652d2dc7abb5419fc972b9c","category":"Tech"}
