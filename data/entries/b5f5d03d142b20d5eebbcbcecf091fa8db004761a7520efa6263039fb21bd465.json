Skiff users have just six months before their email and all other data are wiped out. If you set up forwarding before the shutdown date, Skiff says it will keep forwarding your email to another service for the next year.</p>\n<p>Skiff's website has been replaced with the purchase notice and a link to a <a href=\"https://skiff.com/data-migration\">data migration page,</a> which says, \"We will be closing down Skiff's product suite after a 6-month sunset period.\" Acquisitions happen all the time, but in this case, there will be no transfer or continuation of service over to Notion. Users will lose their @skiff.com email address and all data will be deleted, so export your mail soon. Skiff has export services available at <a href=\"https://app.skiff.com/dashboard/?settingTab=export\">https://app.skiff.com/dashboard/?settingTab=export</a>.</p>\n<p>Losing your email address can be a nightmare, as it can feel almost impossible to chase down every service you've tied to your account. Based on the pile of posts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skiffprivacy/status/1756093174806974831/quotes\">inundating Skiff's account</a> on X, Skiff users seem pretty upset by the move. The <a href=\"https://skiff.com/\">main page</a> of skiff.com doesn't even mention the impending shutdown. A sign-off reads, \"We look forward to continuing to serve you,\" so it's easy to assume that the service will keep running.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003015#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003015&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b5f5d03d142b20d5eebbcbcecf091fa8db004761a7520efa6263039fb21bd465","category":"Tech"}
