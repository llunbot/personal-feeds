The controller, designed for use with the iPhone and iPad, is priced at $49.99 on Apple's online store and delivers in one to two days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/2021-rotor-riot-game-controller-iphone.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRotor Riot is advertised as the only Lightning-connected, full-sized game controller available today. The direct Lightning connection ensures low latency and eliminates the need to wirelessly pair the controller to an iPhone or iPad, and the controller also lacks a battery since it is powered directly by the device it is connected to. The controller's built-in Lightning connector allows for pass-through charging of the iPhone or iPad during usage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe controller continues to come with an optional \"Zero Gravity device holder\" in the box for use with the iPhone 6 and newer. A full list of devices compatible with the controller is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPT62ZM/A/rotor-riot-lightning-connected-game-controller\">available on Apple's online store</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe controller otherwise looks similar to the previous version, with analog left and right joysticks, digital A/B/X/Y buttons, digital L1 and R1 bumpers, analog L2 and R2 triggers, digital L3 and R3 clickable thumb-sticks, and a digital d-pad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther items added to Apple's online store this week include <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPT92ZM/A/mophie-portable-stand-with-magsafe\">Mophie's portable MagSafe stand</a> for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models, new AirTag key rings <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPTU2ZM/A/otterbox-rugged-case-for-airtag\">from OtterBox</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPU42ZM/A/incase-woolenex-key-clip-for-airtag\">Incase</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPST2ZM/A/sandisk-ixpand-flash-drive-luxe-usb-type-c-flash-drive-128gb\">a 128GB flash storage stick from SanDisk</a> with both USB-C and Lightning connectors, an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPTB2ZM/A/incase-facet-sleeve-for-13-macbook-air-and-macbook-pro\">Incase sleeve for the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro</a>, and more.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/new-rotor-riot-game-controller-iphone-ipad/\">Apple Begins Selling New Accessories, Including Updated Rotor Riot Game Controller for iPhone and iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-new-accessories-including-updated-rotor-riot-game-controller-for-iphone-and-ipad.2322765/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TZq3vusAhn4:FR61TZeoheo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TZq3vusAhn4:FR61TZeoheo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c9285b3296171091ac96a84591889a374b6a0f237620b328eda91d475cc146dc","category":"Apple"}
