Since TDK introduced it in 2020, competitors have moved forward, developing small solid-state batteries that offer 50 Wh/l, while rechargeable coin batteries using traditional liquid electrolytes offer about 400 Wh/l, according to the group.</p>\n<p>“We believe that our newly developed material for solid-state batteries can make a significant contribution to the energy transformation of society. We will continue the development towards early commercialisation,” said TDK’s chief executive Noboru Saito.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031911#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031911&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"651912d9cbef1e10a96651e81ddca61b75b1be8c74cedf13bcb9caf67689f093","category":"Tech"}
