It allows for a wider variety of viewing angles. Its refresh rate when idle can update information from apps and complications once a second, instead of the existing once a minute rate.</p>\n<p>The 9.7 mm case, the thinnest Watch so far, required miniaturization of various components, including the speaker, logic board, and metal backing. The aluminum version weighs 10 percent less than the previous generation. The titanium version, replacing stainless steel, shaves even more weight off the Watch than the already reduced Series 10.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048302#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048302&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"84876b2e728677e9eb39a130a610750f29ee6bd2636e3f1d49a6be7e1d22a5fd","category":"Tech"}
