Priced at $140, the charger comes in black or a multicolor option with shades of blue and white, and it is made from recycled plastic and aluminum.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's a Qi2 magnetic charger that is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> iPhones and able to charge them at up to 15W, along with a fast charger for compatible Apple Watch models. The AirPods platform charges the AirPods at 5W. The ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch charging pucks can be used while upright or folded flat, and because of the folding mechanism, this has the potential to work well for travel. The charger ships with a USB-C to USB-C cable and a 36W USB-C power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor charging on the go, Apple is offering an exclusive <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRY02LL/A/anker-maggo-power-bank-5k-slim-blue\">MagGo Power Bank from Anker</a>, which is priced at $50. The MagGo comes in either blue or white, and it offers Qi2 charging at up to 15W. There is a 5,000mAh battery inside that will add extra power to an ‌iPhone‌, and it's super slim compared to other magnetic power banks so it won't add too much bulk to an ‌iPhone‌. There is a USB-C port for charging purposes, and while it comes with a USB-C cable, you'll need to supply your own power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/anker-battery-pack-apple.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIf you have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, you might be interested in the latest Vision Pro carrying case that Apple's offering through its online store.
