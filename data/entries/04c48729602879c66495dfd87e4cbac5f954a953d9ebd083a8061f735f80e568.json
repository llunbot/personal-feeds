It offers better performance, a more modern design, an improved display and some small but excellent improvements. There will be many for whom the older model is more than adequate, but the newer model costs just $100/£100 more and offers so much more value for money so it is our recommendation.  </p>\n</div><h3>Price When Reviewed</h3><p>Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (2022, M2): $1,099 (WAS $1,199)</p><p>Apple MacBook Air (2020) M1: From $999</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (2022, M2)\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/best-buy-logo.png\" alt=\"Best Buy\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$999.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6509648&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6509648%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-784743-2-782218-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/amazon-logo.svg\" alt=\"Amazon\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1,095.76</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/adorama-logo.png\" alt=\"Adorama\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1099.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=ACMLY33LLA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmly33lla.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/apple-logo.svg\" alt=\"Apple\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1099.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/473657/7613?prodsku=MLY13LL%2FA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fproduct%2FMLY13&amp;intsrc=CATF_3652&amp;subid1=1-1-784743-2-782218-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView more prices\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air went on sale in July 2022. Compared to the M1 MacBook Air that launched in November 2020, it was completely revised, not just on the inside, but for the first time in years, also on the outside. The 2022 MacBook Air has a better chip, a bigger display (13.6-inch, up from 13.3-inch), and a brand-new design. But if you look in the Apple Store you will notice you can still buy its predecessor (at least for now). Is it worth spending more to get the new model? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we look at how the 13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2 compares to the 13.3-inch MacBook Air, M1 from 2020, examining how much more powerful the new model is, and whether that extra oomph is worth the higher price. For even more information, check out our full reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\">M1 MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">M2 MacBook Air</a>. We also evaluate <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/669997/best-macbook-apple-laptop.html\">which Mac laptop is best</a> in our separate buying guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we first wrote this article in July 2022, a couple of things have changed: in June 2023 Apple introduced a larger version of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">M2 MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen</a>. At the same time, the company dropped the price of the M2 MacBook Air with 13.6-inch screen by $100/£100. The new price for the entry-level M2 MacBook Air is now $1,099/£1,149, which is just $100/£150 more than the price of the older M1 MacBook Air that remains on sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M2 MacBook Air vs M1: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2022 MacBook Air is certainly an eye-catcher and stands out clearly from its predecessor. This MacBook Air gained a brand new design that includes a bigger screen as well as new color finishes. But it still has a similar footprint to the M1 model:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2, dimensions</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>0.44in x 11.97in x 8.46in</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.13cm x 30.41cm x 21.5cm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2.7 pounds (1.24 kg)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>13.3-inch MacBook Air, M1, dimensions</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>0.16–0.63in x 11.97in x 8.36in</li>\n\n\n\n<li>0.41–1.61cm x 30.41cm x 21.24cm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2.8 pounds (1.29 kg)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 15-inch MacBook Air is larger and heavier, as you would expect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The width of the two laptops is the same, which makes sense because it allows for a full-size keyboard. The M2 model is a few millimeters deeper to allow for a larger screen and on average, this model is narrower than before – although it’s not tapered so the smallest edge isn’t as slim as it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the tapered design allowed Apple to make a light laptop, it was also a disadvantage, as it meant less space for ports on the outside and limited space on the inside for heat dispersion. Despite the difference in design, however, both models are fanless, which could be a disadvantage to power users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors that the 2022 MacBook Air was losing its tapered design proved correct, but any hopes that this would mean more ports have been scuppered. The M2 MacBook Air has the same two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports as its predecessor and doesn’t have an HDMI port like the 14-inch or 16-inch MacBook Pro. The new model adds MagSafe for charging to free up a Thunderbolt port, but otherwise, both models are the same: Touch ID, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, 802.11ax, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big difference is the color options. The M2 models have a choice of Midnight (bluish-black) and Starlight (pale gold), as well as space gray and silver (which looks slightly paler than the previous shade). The 2020 MacBook Air comes in space gray, silver, and gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other eye-catching difference between the M1 and M2 models is the addition of a notch for the camera. Like the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, the M2 MacBook Air has very slim bezels that can’t quite fit the camera. When the notch arrived on the larger MacBook Pro models in 2021 there was some criticism, but if you consider that Apple has added screen space on either side of the notch and made the display taller, you’re not actually losing any space.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4350164_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Macbook Air M2\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The M2 MacBook Air looks a lot like MacBook Pro now.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>M2 MacBook Air vs M1: Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The display size is the other key difference between the new M1 and M2 MacBook Air. The 2022 model has a 13.6-inch display, compared to the 13.3-inch display on the M1 model. The new model is also brighter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Air M2: 13.6 inches, 2560 x 1664, 500 nits brightness</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Air M1: 13.3 inches, 2560 x 1600, 400 nits brightness</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The brighter screen brings it into line with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, but places it far below that of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with 1,000 nits of max brightness. It also lacks the ProMotion technology of those models.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"M2 vs M1 MacBook Air display size\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 6000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-display-size.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption>M2 MacBook Air has a larger display compared to M1 MacBook Air</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air has a Liquid Retina display, rather than the Retina display of the M1 model (and the M2 MacBook Pro). The main difference is that the Liquid Retina display has better contrast ratios, support for more colors (a billion, rather than millions), and more pixels per inch. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro go a step further with the superior Liquid Retina XDR display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to these changes the display of the M2 MacBook Air isn’t only better than its predecessor—it’s also better than the 13-inch MacBook Pro. In everyday life, however, these differences will rarely be noticeable, although the increased brightness is a plus. The better color representation, on the other hand, will be a benefit for professional design work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a big screen is what you are after you might be interested to learn about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> which launched in July 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M2 MacBook Air vs M1: Processor, RAM, and battery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple currently sells five MacBook Air models: one <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676321/m1-pro-max-ultra-guide.html\">M1</a> 13-inch model and two <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678191/apple-m2-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-m2-macs.html\">M2</a> 13-inch models and two 15-inch MacBook Air. There are also a number of build-to-order options. All the M2 MacBook Air models have identical specs, so we won’t list the 15-inch specs separately.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Air M1 with 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage: $999/£999</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of upgrade options, you can add 16GB RAM for $200, 512GB storage ($200), 1TB storage ($400), 2TB storage ($800). The 8-core GPU option is no longer available for this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Air M2 with 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 8GB memory, 256GB storage: $1,099/£1,149</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of upgrade options, you can add 16GB RAM for $200, 24GB ($400) 512GB storage ($200), 1TB storage ($400), 2TB storage ($800).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Air M2 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 8GB memory, 512GB storage: $1,399/£1,449</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of upgrade options, you can add 16GB RAM for $200, 24GB ($400), 1TB storage ($200), 2TB storage ($600).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll look into those components in more detail below:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>CPU</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the M1, the M2 has four performance cores and four efficiency cores, for a total of 8 CPU cores, but the efficiency cores have been enhanced and there is a larger cache (16MB rather than 12MB). As a result clock speeds can be faster and you can expect improved multithreaded performance compared to the M1. In our testing, the M2 has an 18 percent faster CPU than the M1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new chip doesn’t just mean that the new Macs can accomplish more though, they use less power doing so: Apple promises an increased CPU performance of 18 percent with the same energy consumption thanks to various optimizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We originally ran Geekbench 5 to see how the new CPU performed. Since then Geekbench 6.1 has arrived so we have run benchmarks again, which can be seen below. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our original Geekbench 5 scores showed that the M2 MacBook Air delivered peak performance in line with the M2 MacBook Pro, and was a bit better than the M1. It’s not going to beat the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/556384/apple-silicon-iphone-ipad-mac-processors-benchmarks.html\">higher-end M2 Pro and Max processors in the MacBook Pro</a> though. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We also ran the Cinebench R23 benchmark, here it was more obvious that the active cooling of the MacBook Pro makes a difference despite the same M2 chip being used. But the 2022 MacBook Air was 15 percent faster than the M1 model.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>GPU</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The higher-end M2 with 10 GPU cores offers a 35 percent more powerful GPU than the M1, based on benchmarks. However, the base model of the M2 Air has a slightly lesser GPU with only 8 GPU cores, so we expect the gains to be less with the $1,099 model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor aiding the M2’s graphics prowess is the addition of engines specifically for video editing in the M2. Plus Apple claims that the Neural Engine is 40 percent faster than in the M1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ran the Geekbench 5 Compute test on the 10-core GPU MacBook Air. This model was almost 60 percent faster than the old 7-core M1 MacBook Air (which is no real surprise), but they were also about 40 percent faster than the 8 GPU cores in the M1 MacBook Pro and on par with the same M2 chip in the MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In our tests the M2 MacBook Air, with a full 10-core GPU, was also roughly 40% faster than the M1 Air with 7 GPU cores in Rise of the Tomb Raider, and between 20-50 percent faster in Civilization VI, depending on the settings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Memory and Storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the standard memory offered by both the M1 and M2 MacBook Pro is the same: 8GB Unified Memory, the performance is not the same. According to Apple, the M2 delivers 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to M1 (100GB/s memory bandwidth) so there should be some noticeable improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the biggest difference is the amount of memory. Where the M1 MacBook Air tops off at 16GB memory, the M2 MacBook Air can take as much as 24GB. That’s still less than the 32GB of the M1 Pro models, but it’s an improvement and will no doubt please those who were concerned that 16GB wasn’t enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for storage, both the M1 and M2 MacBook Air ship with 256GB as standard and max out at 2TB for up to $800 more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Webcam and Speakers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The webcam in the M2 supports a resolution of 1080p, which is significantly better than the low-grade 720p FaceTime HD camera in the M1 MacBook Air. That leaves the M1 MacBook Air and M2 MacBook Pro as the only laptops with the old camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speakers have also been updated in the M2 MacBook Air. Instead of relying on a stereo system, the 2022 MacBook Air features four speakers with support for 3D audio, aka Spatial Audio. In addition, the 3.5mm headphone jack offers advanced support for high-impedance headphone. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-WWDC22-MacBook-Air-ports-220606.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MacBook Air from the side showing Magsafe and two Thunderbolt ports\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-WWDC22-MacBook-Air-ports-220606.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1579w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-WWDC22-MacBook-Air-ports-220606.jpg?resize=300%2C134&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-WWDC22-MacBook-Air-ports-220606.jpg?resize=768%2C342&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-WWDC22-MacBook-Air-ports-220606.jpg?resize=1200%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-WWDC22-MacBook-Air-ports-220606.jpg?resize=1536%2C685&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"535\" /><figcaption>The new MacBook Air with M2 also offers a MagSafe port. </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Power and battery</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With a new 67W power supply (sold separately for $20 with the 8-core GPU model, or a free option with the 10-core GPU model) you can quickly charge the M2 MacBook Air to 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. The M2 MacBook Air charges via the magnetically attached MagSafe port, so you no longer have to worry about pulling your MacBook off a desk when you stumble over the cable. There’s a 30W USB-C Power Adapter (included with the 8-core GPU M2 and the choice of a more compact 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter (with the 10-core GPU M2).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air has a larger battery than its predecessor: a 52.6-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery rather than the 49.9-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery of the previous generation. Coupled with Apple’s claims that the M2 means the 2022 MacBook Air is more power efficient might lead you to suppose that the new MacBook Air would have better battery life, but Apple states that battery life is the same 18 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our own battery tests the battery lasted 17.5 hours, which was very close enough to Apple’s 18-hour claim. In our tests the M2 MacBook Air battery beat the M1 MacBook Air and M2 MacBook Pro by almost an hour and a half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also ran our Movie playback battery life test on the two sizes of M2 MacBook Air and the M1 MacBook Air, and found that the difference between the two M2 models isn’t as big as you might think, given the larger battery in the larger MacBook. Bith are better than the M1 MacBook AIr, and on a par with the 14-inch MacBook Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Read our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html\">best chargers for MacBook Air</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M2 MacBook Air vs M1: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering buying a MacBook Air right now there are three models to choose from: the original 2020 M1 MacBook Air with a 7-core GPU for <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-784743-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/with-m1-chip\">$999/£999</a>, a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676165/new-macbook-air.html\">M2 MacBook Air</a> with an 8-core GPU for <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-784743-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/with-m2-chip\">$1,099/£1,149</a> (reduced from $1,199/£1,239, and a top-of-the-range M2 MacBook Air with 10-core GPU for <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-784743-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/with-m2-chip\">$1,399/£1,449</a> (reduced from $1,499/£1,549). Read about why if you can afford it then you should buy the $1,399/£1,449 MacBook Air in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/820921/m2-macbook-air-m2-performance-cpu-gpu-ssd.html\">the $1,099 M2 MacBook Air isn’t as good as it looks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new model offers an M2 processor with more GPU cores, a bigger screen, and a brand-new design for just $100/£150 more than the M1 model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision is pretty simple really. The newer MacBook Air only costs a small amount more than the older model and for that $100/£150 extra you get a lot more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is only one reason to consider the M1 MacBook Air–it may not be on sale for much longer. If you want the older style MacBook AIr then time may be running out to buy one. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M1 vs M2 MacBook Air: Our recommendation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Air with M2 is in many respects a significant improvement over its predecessor. It offers better performance, a more modern design, an improved display, and some smaller but notable improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of those users who use the MacBook primarily for everyday tasks, such as surfing the web, reading emails or watching videos, you may be attracted to the cheaper $999/£999 M1 MacBook Air. A M1 Macbook Air will be able to handle all these tasks without any problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you want to save money, rather than buy an M1 MacBook Air we recommend looking for a deal on the M2 MacBook Air. If you look around you may be able to get an M2 MacBook Air for as much as, or less than, the M1 model. See our round-up of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673333/best-macbook-air-deals.html\">MacBook Air deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do more with your MacBook or use it for professional applications such as video editing or photo editing, the M2 MacBook Air is definitely worth the extra money compared to its predecessor. In fact, if your budget allows, we recommend jumping to the higher-end model with a 10-core GPU, extra storage and better graphics. And as always, you should buy as much memory as you can afford.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 MacBook Air is still a good machine, even as it heads for its third anniversary, but you’ll be much happier with the newer MacBook Air in a year or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best prices for the MacBook Air M1, usually $999/£999 are below. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/amazon-logo.svg\" alt=\"Amazon\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$799.99</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5KWB9H?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/best-buy-logo.png\" alt=\"Best Buy\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$799.99</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6418597/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-784743-4-663712-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/adorama-logo.png\" alt=\"Adorama\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$869</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgn93lla.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-784743-4-663712-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://idg-live.getsquirrel.co/assets/images/retailers/11354_267133b099d72294fbae78825a8e7be3.png\" alt=\"Walmart Electronics\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$979.95</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-with-Apple-M1-Chip-13-inch-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Storage-Silver-Latest-Model/715596133&amp;subid1=1-1-784743-4-663712-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/apple-logo.svg\" alt=\"Apple\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$999</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-784743-4-663712-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MGN93\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView more prices\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"04c48729602879c66495dfd87e4cbac5f954a953d9ebd083a8061f735f80e568","category":"Apple"}
