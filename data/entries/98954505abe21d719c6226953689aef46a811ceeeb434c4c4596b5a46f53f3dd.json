It looks unusual, but it supposedly offers a truly perfect fit.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>It sure is… different.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Instead of traditional EPS foam, KAV uses hexagonal cells that collapse in an impact to absorb and dissipate energy.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-4-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>KAV’s energy-absorbing liner is similar in concept to Koroyd or WaveCel. Helmets supposedly easily pass various test certifications.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-5-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Some color would be nice, no?</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-6-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>KAV measured my head while I was at the show, and will supposedly be providing me with a custom-printed test sample in the next few days.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-7-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Even the pads are 3D-printed, and they sport a novel “constant pressure” design that can account for changes in hair volume or hats without feeling tighter on your head.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-8-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The multiple sections of the helmet are bonded together, and also held together with little dovetail wedges.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KAV-3D-printed-helmet-9-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>It’s such a radically different aesthetic that I’m not sure how well it’ll be received. It’s also very expensive at US$375, and not particularly light at just under 300 g.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moon-Garmin-light-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The Moon Sport MX is an out-front computer mount and front light all in one.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moon-Garmin-light-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Moon Sport combines a 1-watt CREE LED emitter to help light the way if you get stuck past sundown, while underneath is a more conventional flasher for “be seen” visibility.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moon-Garmin-light-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The standard setup is designed to attach to four-bolt removable stem faceplates.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moon-Garmin-light-4-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>There’s also an optional handlebar clamp version. I’m quite intrigued, and hope to bring one of these in for a proper review.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Redshift-Sports-pedals-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Redshift Sports’ new Arclight pedals incorporate front and rear LED lights to boost visibility. Built-in sensors tell the pedal which way is front and back, and automatically switch the light color to suit. Retail price will be /US$135 per pair.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Redshift-Sports-pedals-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The light “modules” can also be used as standalone front or rear lights.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Redshift-Sports-pedals-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>More magnets!</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Redshift-Sports-ShockStop-Pro-seatpost-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>New from Redshift Sports is the ShockStop Pro seatpost (left), which trades the standard version’s (right) steel coil spring for lighter-weight elastomers, along with revamped links.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Redshift-Sports-ShockStop-Pro-seatpost-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Weight drops precipitously relative to the standard ShockStop seatpost, with claimed weights as low as 379  g for a 27.2 mm-diameter size with 20 mm of travel. A nice touch is the dust guard, which attaches with magnets.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Cane Creek’s new eeSilk+ suspension seatpost (left) sports an additional 15 mm of travel as compared to the standard eeSilk (right) while only adding 28 grams. Claimed weight for a 27.2×362 mm carbon model is just 323 g. Retail price is US$320 for the carbon version, and US$220 for the aluminum one.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cane-Creek-compression-plug-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Cane Creek’s new Ancora headset compression plug is unusually light at just 24 g.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cane-Creek-compression-plug-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Cane Creek put in a fair bit of extra effort to shave grams from the Ancora headset compression plug. The inside of the knurled sleeve is machined away, for example, and the bolt is aluminum.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tannus-tire-inserts-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Tannus has a new tubeless-compatible foam tire liner (in pink) to go along with its original tube-type liner (in red).</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tannus-tire-inserts-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The unusual shape supposedly still provides tire casing support and rim protection, but the open rim end works with standard tubeless valve stems.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tannus-tire-inserts-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Claimed weights are pretty impressive for Tannus’s new tubeless-compatible foam tire inserts. Gravel models are just 70 g each.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DT-Swiss-D-232-One-dropper-seatpost-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The DT Swiss D 232 One dropper seatpost is aimed at XC mountain bikes, but it could also be a viable option for some gravel bikes if the dimensions are compatible with your frame. Claimed weight is just 369 g.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DT-Swiss-D-232-One-dropper-seatpost-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Helping to shave the grams are a carbon fiber inverted head, and a carbon fiber shaft (to which an aluminum sleeve is bonded to provide a consistent sliding surface).</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DT-Swiss-D-232-One-dropper-seatpost-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Fun detail: the actuator rod for DT Swiss’s D 232 One dropper seatpost is a 15-gauge stainless steel spoke.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/tech-gallery-2021-sea-otter-classic-day-one/\">Read More</a>","author":"James Huang","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"98954505abe21d719c6226953689aef46a811ceeeb434c4c4596b5a46f53f3dd","category":"Cycling"}
