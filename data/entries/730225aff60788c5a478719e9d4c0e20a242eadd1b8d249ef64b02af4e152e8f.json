Warner Bros. Pictures decided to offer additional IMAX screenings due to \"overwhelming popularity\" for the film so far, with the initial 25 screenings that it offered all sold out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTickets for the early IMAX screenings and general showings go on sale starting tomorrow, May 21.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe film will tell a familiar underdog story. Brad Pitt stars as an F1 driver who was an up-and-coming talent in the 1990s, until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, Pitt is invited to join a former teammate's struggling F1 team, in a last-shot bid to save the team and become the best in the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe film is directed by Joseph Kosinski, who is known for other popular action films, including \"Tron: Legacy\" and \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nF1: The Movie will be available to stream on Apple TV+ at a later date. In the U.S., Apple TV+ costs $9.99 per month, or $99 per year. The streaming service is available through the Apple TV app on a wide variety of devices, and <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/\">on the web at tv.apple.com</a>, with a free seven-day trial available.
