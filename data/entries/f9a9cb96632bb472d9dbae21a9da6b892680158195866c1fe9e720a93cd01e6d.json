I keep it around because it has an optical drive–it was the last Apple laptop with the feature. Since I’m the go-to tech support guy in the family, I’ve used that laptop more than I expected to get data from <s>old</s> vintage discs. (For you young’uns, an <em>optical drive</em> is used to read data from things called CDs, DVDs, and in some instances (but not this one), Blu-ray discs.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that 2012 MacBook Pro is now dead to Apple. As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-declares-last-macbook-pro-with-an-optical-drive-obsolete/&amp;xcust=1-1-2224787-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">spotted by Ars Technica</a>, the company officially put it on its obsolete list, which means that “all hardware service” has ceased and that “service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products,” according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624&amp;xcust=1-1-2224787-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s support document about vintage and obsolete products</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Apple product is considered “vintage” between 5 and 7 years after it has stopped being available for sale. “Service and parts may be obtained for longer, as required by law or for up to 7 years, subject to parts availability,” according to Apple. After that, a product can be declared “obsolete.” If you have an obsolete product, you can’t take it to an Apple Store for repairs. You can try to take it to a third-party repair shop, but that shop will have to find other means besides Apple to get parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This specific MacBook Pro model was introduced in June 2012 and actually stayed in Apple’s lineup for a long time despite being replaced by an optical drive-free model in late 2012. Apple offered the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an optical drive until October 2016 as a cheaper option, according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://mactracker.ca/&amp;xcust=1-1-2224787-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mactracker</a>, which also states that its marketing tagline was, “We put more into it. So you can get more out of it.” Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">ended macOS support</a> for this model when Big Sur arrived 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple called its optical drive the “SuperDrive,” and it was able to burn CDs and DVDs. Apple still sells an external USB SuperDrive for <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435395/7636?subid1=1-1-2224787-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive\">$79</a>/<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435395/7636?subid1=1-1-2224787-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MD564ZM/A/apple-usb-superdrive\">£79</a> (in the U.S. it’s a <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14156&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MD564LL-A-USB-SuperDrive/dp/B011K4XZQ0/?ascsubtag=1-1-2224787-1-0-0\">couple of bucks cheaper on Amazon</a>), but it uses a USB-A connector, so you’ll need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to use the drive on a modern Mac. Third-party optical drives that are much cheaper are also available.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f9a9cb96632bb472d9dbae21a9da6b892680158195866c1fe9e720a93cd01e6d","category":"Apple"}
