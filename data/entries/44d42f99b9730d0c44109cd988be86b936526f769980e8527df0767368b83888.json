It measures 13″ wide x 12″ long x 11″ tall and fits a complete drivetrain, which is why I selected this model.</em></p>\n<h3>What is an Ultrasonic Cleaner?</h3>\n<p>The principal tech behind an ultrasonic cleaner is cavitation bubbles. These tiny bubbles are formed by high-frequency sound waves emitted by a transducer. The transducer is fixed to the bottom of the cleaner’s tank. As the transducer vibrates, the tank’s bottom vibrates.</p>\n<p>Once the tank reaches the appropriate resonation, it produces high-frequency waves and, due to a drop in pressure created by these waves, cavitation bubbles. But what makes it unique is that the high-frequency waves create pressure lower than 14.7 PSI – or sea level pressure – and allow the water to get very hot without boiling in the tank.</p>\n<p>When paired with a degreaser, even dish soap, the ultrasonic cleaner’s cavitation bubbles can break the bonds between dirt, oil, grease, and grime.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Ultrasonic Cleaners and Aluminum</h3>\n<p>These vibrations generated by ultrasonic cleaning can cause pitting in aluminum if the cleaning solution is not appropriate. Acidic and alkaline cleaning solutions can accelerate aluminum’s corrosion process and lead to surface pitting.</p>\n<p>This is why it’s super important to always use a cleaning solution that is specifically designed for use with aluminum. These solutions are typically neutral or slightly alkaline and do not contain harsh chemicals that can cause pitting. For example. <a href=\"https://simplegreen.com/industrial/products/extreme-aircraft-precision-cleaner/\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Green Extreme</a> is safe for aluminum in ultrasonic tanks, but standard Simple Green is not. <em>(Thanks <a href=\"https://nminus1bikes.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">James Huang</a> for the tip!)</em></p>\n<p>Luckily, we have a variety of aluminum-safe degreases at our disposal in the bike industry but it is still recommended to always do a small test before going all in.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Right Cleaner</h3>\n<p>I first saw ultrasonic cleaners used in carburetor shops. These shops will submerge a carb in the tank with dish soap to completely clean them. Later, Tasshi from the Vintage MTB Workshop had one in his shop to clean his various vintage parts during restorations. Even the gunkiest and grodiest chain or freewheel can look brand new with a good bath in an ultrasonic cleaner.</p>\n<p>I’ve experimented with dish soap, citrus bike degreaser, and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9c3967ea-9801-442a-9d09-419007ae71c3&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilca.cc%2Fproducts%2Fchain-stripper\" target=\"_blank\">Silca’s Stripper</a>. They all work well across the spectrum of clean but if we’re being cautious with temps and time in the tank with our aluminum parts, I’d rather use a cleaner like Silca’s Stripper for less time to get better results than dish soap with longer time.</p>\n<p>My local shop, Sincere Cycles, had this Silca Stripper in stock, which is how I ended up using it for this job.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>My Sous Vide Procedure Cuts Down on Waste</h3>\n<p>Rather than waste liters upon liters of degreaser, I fill the tank halfway with distilled water and bag my parts in big ziplock bags, then put the degreaser or soap into the bags, like a sous vide cooking method. I divided the groupset with the chain and ring in one bag, the cassette in another, and the derailleur in the last bag. Then put 1/3 of the Silca Stripper in each bag. This does a few things. It makes clean-up easier, keeps the tank water clean (and thus re-usable), and ensures the degreaser has constant contact with the part. The bubbles aren’t “blocked” by the bags, and you can still see them working when you peek inside the tank.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>I installed these parts on Cari’s Elephant NFE in 2017 I think? They haven’t been cleaned since… </em></p>\n<p>I’ll turn on the tank with water halfway filled and allow it to reach the desired temperature. I found 60º C to be the sweet spot. Once it’s at operating temperatures, I’ll carefully drop the bags with the parts soaking in degreaser into the tank and let it run for 20 minutes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Once that first soaking period is finished, I’ll check the progress on the chain. It if looks like it needs more time, I’ll add it in for another 25 minutes. Cari’s drivetrain was pretty gunky. We’ve been using Squirt wax lube since moving to Santa Fe and her drivetrain had accumulated lots of waxy grease.</p>\n<p>Once the process is done, I’ll remove the bags, let them cool off for a few minutes and then remove the parts. The photos you see below have not been wiped down yet. They came out that clean! From here, I’ll take all the parts, rinse them off and then re-install them, save for the chain, which I waxed with Silca’s waxing system.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-11.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-11.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Before and After Photos</h3>\n<p>The chain is a no-brainer. Of course, it’s going to be nice and clean with the Silca Stripper. That stuff works really well in a jar by itself. However, I found the Ultrasonic Cleaner to be very helpful with chainrings, cassettes, and derailleurs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-15.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-15.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Normally, I’d have to take the pulley wheels out and remove other parts to get in with some degreaser and wipe/floss the derailleur clean. The cavitation bubbles worked their magic and removed all the grime and built-up gunk on this GX derailleur in just 45 minutes. It looks like new! Well, aside from all the scratches on the face.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-16.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-16.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This Sun Race cassette was spotless as well. Every single nook and cranny got cleaned, down to the threads on the lockring.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I hate cleaning chainrings. Sure, they’re easy but no matter what, I find myself going over each tiny edge over and over again. It’s also very messy usually as you’re wiping grease off in giant globs. With this method, all the goopy goo was left inside the ziplock bag and what came out was a like-new chainring!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-19.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-19.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-20.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-20.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Ultrasonic-Cleaner-Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Are they Worth It?</h3>\n<p>If you’re mindful about bike maintenance, like to tinker with various degreasers, temps, and time, the ultrasonic cleaner can drastically cut down on your degreasing times. They virtually eliminate gross and grody brushes, rags, and hands. While the cleaner itself is loud – like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Aw8BrVLmrI?si=4GvEDNKHIwCGEb87&amp;t=1322\" target=\"_blank\">Merzbow</a>-level noise – you can always put it in a far corner of the house where you won’t hear it.</p>\n<p>Afterward, I waxed Cari’s chain using <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9c3967ea-9801-442a-9d09-419007ae71c3&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilca.cc%2Fcollections%2Fchain-waxing-system\" target=\"_blank\">Silca’s Chain Waxing System</a>. Seriously, in our dry climate, I get about a year out of each waxing job! I still use <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9c3967ea-9801-442a-9d09-419007ae71c3&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilca.cc%2Fproducts%2Fstrip-chip\" target=\"_blank\">Strip Chip</a> but I don’t think it’s necessary.</p>\n<p>After I experimented with various temperatures, times, and cleaners, my method worked great for a standard drivetrain maintenance job. From disassembling Cari’s drivetrain completely to warming up the cleaner and chain waxing, it took me two hours. My main goal in owning an ultrasonic cleaner is to stay on top of maintenance more.</p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>The easier something is, the more likely it’ll happen over here, and by that logic alone, this system is well worth it, particularly with more modern drivetrains that cost a lot of money upfront or vintage parts that are harder and harder to find. When you have a lot of bikes to maintain or are constantly tinkering with vintage mountain bikes, a time-saving tool like this is well worth its price tag.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much faster and more thorough</li>\n<li>More eco-friendly with less mess with <em>Sous Vide</em> method</li>\n<li>Can use common dish soap, Citrus Stripper, or other “eco” friendly cleaners</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9c3967ea-9801-442a-9d09-419007ae71c3&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilca.cc%2Fproducts%2Fchain-stripper\" target=\"_blank\">Silca Stripper</a> works like a champ!</li>\n<li>Various tub sizes are available.</li>\n<li>Extends the life of your drivetrain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IcA0TF0b3FI?si=MSQlVaOnNI9vBsBf&amp;t=859\" target=\"_blank\">industrial noise bands</a>, you’ll love the sound it emits</li>\n<li>While the 15L is large, it fits all the components needed in one batch, but it is large</li>\n<li>Did I mention the noise?</li>\n<li>Everything is expensive nowadays; this is no different at $145</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Do you use an ultrasonic cleaner?
