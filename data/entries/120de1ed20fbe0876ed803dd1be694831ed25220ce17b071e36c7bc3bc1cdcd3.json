This appears to be the same sole as The Road Shoe, with markers for cleat position and an embossed Adidas logo. It has heel and toe pads, as well as a loop on the heel.</p>\n<p>The upper of the shoe uses lightweight recycled material and has two mesh sections, which are said to provide plenty of ventilation and aid cooling.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/12/adidas-the-indoor-shoe-4-6a9fe2e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Adidas says the shoe meets the high-intensity efforts of indoor training.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Adidas</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/12/adidas-the-indoor-shoe-3-52efabb.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The shoe has a lightweight upper and appears to have the same sole as Adidas’s The Road Shoe. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Adidas</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Indoor Shoe has Adidas’s unmistakable three-stripe design on the side, much like its football boots and running shoes.</p>\n<p>Available in white, black or ‘Acid Red’, Adidas says the shoe offers “all cyclists the ability to choose a shoe to match their individual style”.</p>\n<p>Adidas says creating a variety of options for an array of cyclists is a leading objective for the brand with its cycling shoes.</p>\n<p>Celine Del Genes, general manager of Adidas’s specialist sports department, emphasises the brand’s desire “to cater to the needs of a rapidly developing new cycling culture”, which was a message shared with the release of The Gravel Shoe, too.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"120de1ed20fbe0876ed803dd1be694831ed25220ce17b071e36c7bc3bc1cdcd3","category":"Cycling"}
