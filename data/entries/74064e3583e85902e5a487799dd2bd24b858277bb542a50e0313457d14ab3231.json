The rear camera designs will ditch the square corner array for the first time in years. The Pro models will be thicker than ever. And the iPhone 17 Air will usher in a new, tremendously thin model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But according to a new report, this year’s launch is just the beginning of the changes. <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles\">As reported by The Information</a>, which has a very strong track record with Apple rumors, Apple will completely change the launch cycle for the iPhone 18, pushing the standard iPhone 18 to a spring launch alongside the iPhone 18e. Why? To make room for a new folding phone launching in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here’s how the lineup and launch cycle could look:</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>September 2025</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 17</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 17 Air</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 17 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 17 Pro Max</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>September 2026</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 18 Air</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18 Fold</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18 Pro Max</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>March 2027</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 18e</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That new split makes it easier for Apple to juggle six iPhone models and sets Apple’s premium phones apart from its entry-level models. It also makes the buying decision somewhat simpler: either you want a premium model in the fall, or you can wait for a lower-end model in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We still don’t know whether Apple plans on updating the iPhone 16e next year, but there are signs that suggest Apple could skip a year. Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2765971/why-apple-probably-shouldnt-update-the-iphone-16e-every-year.html\">reported</a> that Apple hadn’t decided what to do with the model in 2026, and The Information’s report didn’t mention an iPhone 17e in 2026. However, a report by Ming-Chi Kuo on Monday claimed <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/9br1TonGnVzDPP\">Apple will indeed release an iPhone 17e</a> in spring 2026. With Apple Intelligence support and a new design, Apple could easily skip a year between releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 at an event in September.
