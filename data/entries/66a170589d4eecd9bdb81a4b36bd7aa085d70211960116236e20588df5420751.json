This cloth tape is woven in Sweden and is meant to be revitalized when it feels worn out, rather than pitched. The adhesive-free design increases the tape’s life-cycle: Once it feels a bit tired, you can give it a nice spa treatment. Simply remove it residual-free, give it a ride in your washer at 40°C, and reuse it as new.
