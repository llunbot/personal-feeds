The next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is also expected to get the same A18 chip as the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, which would allow it to support Apple Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple has been working on its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-wsj-5gm-modem-project-challenges/\">own 5G modem technology</a> for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/02/apple-intel-modem-deal-completed/\">quite some time</a>, and multiple prior rumors have suggested that the new hardware <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">will first come</a> to the ‌iPhone SE‌, giving Apple a chance to test it out with a lower volume product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 5G chip, codenamed \"Centauri,\" is said to be more than just a modem, alleviating the need for separate Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS components. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said earlier this year that while Apple was working on a modem that was part of a new wireless chip that also included Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, such a product <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/20/apple-custom-modem-could-change-way-iphone-works/\">would not be coming</a> until a later date, so it is not clear which report is accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is Gurman's opinion that the first Apple-designed modem will not yield immediate improvements for users, and there won't be major benefits over Qualcomm modem technology. Over time, though, Apple plans to evolve its modem, more deeply integrating it into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s chipset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman has also said that the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-se-4-8gb-ram-apple-intelligence/\">will get Apple Intelligence</a>, a claim echoed in <em>9to5Mac</em>'s report. The next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ will reportedly include an A18 chip, which is the chip used in the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus. It is also expected to get 8GB RAM, the minimum for Apple Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior rumors have suggested the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 will have a design similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, with a 6.1-inch OLED all-display design and support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>. When Apple introduces the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4, it will officially be the end for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> fingerprint sensor in the ‌iPhone‌ lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThough the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 will have an ‌iPhone‌ 14-like design, it is expected to have a single-lens rear camera. Apple could use the same 48-megapixel Wide camera that was used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther features that could come to the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 include a notch for the TrueDepth camera system (instead of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>), an Action Button, and a USB-C port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone SE‌ is expected to be introduced in early 2025, and it will be priced between $400 and $500.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/iphone-se-4-a18-apple-modem/\">iPhone SE 4 Could Include A18 Chip, All-in-One Apple-Designed 5G Modem With Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-could-include-a18-chip-all-in-one-apple-designed-5g-modem-with-wi-fi-bluetooth-and-gps.2439058/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c4c46f96b0a0d9d5b8823dbaedf609ad6e376977d655dd9e05d78211fd68520b","category":"Apple"}
