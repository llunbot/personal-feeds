Paramount just dropped the full trailer for S2, giving us our first glimpse of Tawny Newsome and Jack Quaid playing the live-action counterparts to their animated <em>Lower Decks</em> characters Beckett Mariner and Brad Boimler. They definitely nailed their respective looks. And yes, part of the crossover episode will be animated in a similar style just to keep things fun.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, notably for S1.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/first-teaser-for-star-trek-strange-new-worlds-s2-is-giving-us-all-the-feels/\">reported previously</a>, the series features classic <em>The Original Series</em> characters Capt.
