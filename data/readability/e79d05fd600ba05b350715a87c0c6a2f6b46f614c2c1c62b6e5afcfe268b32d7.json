For starters, it threads onto a presta valve stem, so it won’t accidentally blow off and waste precious CO2. And it comes with a thick neoprene sleeve for your cartridge, so it won’t freeze your hands, which is good because you simply twist the cartridge to control the flow rate.</p><p>That kit is $17.95, and the chuck weighs just 12g. Not shown, they also have a CO2 Head Adapter that threads into the Co2 chuck and uses a standard I/M air compressor plug, so you can quickly snap it onto your compressor and have a secure, bike-specific connection to help setup tubeless. You can get that in a complete $46 kit with the Prestaflator and…</p><p>The Mini Pump, at just 24g, it’s just 4″ long and designed to top off your tire <em>after</em> using the CO2. Because we all know sometimes the CO2 just isn’t quite enough. Or we overcorrect after overinflating. They say it’s designed to pump up to 120psi with no resistance, too, so even if it takes a while, it shouldn’t be hard. It threads directly onto the Prestaflator chuck and retails for $24.95 on its own.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082246/prestacycle-prestaRatchet-multitool-with-tire-plugger-kit-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082246/prestacycle-prestaRatchet-multitool-with-tire-plugger-kit-01.jpg\" alt=\"prestacycle prestaratchet multi tool with 2 way ratchet and tire plugger insert\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082246/prestacycle-prestaRatchet-multitool-with-tire-plugger-kit-01.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082246/prestacycle-prestaRatchet-multitool-with-tire-plugger-kit-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082246/prestacycle-prestaRatchet-multitool-with-tire-plugger-kit-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082246/prestacycle-prestaRatchet-multitool-with-tire-plugger-kit-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082246/prestacycle-prestaRatchet-multitool-with-tire-plugger-kit-01-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>The PrestaRatchet Multi-Tool gets an upgrade.

For $29.95, you get this complete kit with bit set and wallet, the two-way ratchet, and a tire plugger needle with bacon strips plugs. The needle threads into the lever’s body, giving you a nice “T” handle to push it into the tire with. The handle also doubles as a tire lever.</p><p>The tire plugger and strips will be sold separately, too, for $5.95 in case you break it or lose it.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082251/prestacycle-tire-lever-with-tire-plugger-insert.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082251/prestacycle-tire-lever-with-tire-plugger-insert.jpg\" alt=\"prestacycle tire lever with tire plugger insert\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082251/prestacycle-tire-lever-with-tire-plugger-insert.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082251/prestacycle-tire-lever-with-tire-plugger-insert-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082251/prestacycle-tire-lever-with-tire-plugger-insert-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082251/prestacycle-tire-lever-with-tire-plugger-insert-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07082251/prestacycle-tire-lever-with-tire-plugger-insert-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>Their tire levers get updated to include the threaded hole, too, so you can use the tire plugger with them as well. $9.95 each, available in three colors for now, with purple coming soon.</p><p>Not shown, their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/06/29/hands-on-prestacycle-torqratchet-3-way-ratchet-put-a-new-spin-on-mini-tools/\">TorqRatchet pro</a> gets updated with larger markings and more space between them, making it easier to see when you’ve reached the proper torque spec.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.prestacycle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>PrestaCycle.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e79d05fd600ba05b350715a87c0c6a2f6b46f614c2c1c62b6e5afcfe268b32d7","category":"Cycling"}
