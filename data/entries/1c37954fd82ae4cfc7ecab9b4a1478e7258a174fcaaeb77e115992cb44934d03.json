If you've enabled the ChatGPT extension for Apple Intelligence on your devices, Siri will presumably now default to GPT-4.1 mini going forward.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth models support a one million context token window (the amount of text/media in a prompt that an AI model can process), far surpassing GPT-4o's 128,000-token limit. OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/\">claims</a> that speed improvements make GPT-4.1 \"more appealing for everyday coding tasks\" compared to their recently introduced reasoning models.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-iphone-chatgpt-integration/\">Everything Your iPhone Can Do With ChatGPT</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe deployment comes a few weeks after the new models were released to developers.
