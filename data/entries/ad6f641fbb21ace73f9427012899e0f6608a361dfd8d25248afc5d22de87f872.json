This week has seen three notable large language model (LLM) releases: Google Gemini Pro 1.5 hit <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemini-15-pro-in-public-preview-with-new-features.html\">general availability</a> with a free tier, OpenAI shipped a <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1777772582680301665\">new version</a> of GPT-4 Turbo, and Mistral released a new openly licensed LLM, <a href=\"https://x.com/sophiamyang/status/1777945947764297845\">Mixtral 8x22B</a>. All three of those launches happened within 24 hours starting on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>With the help of software engineer and independent AI researcher Simon Willison (who also <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/10/weeknotes-llm-releases/\">wrote about</a> this week's hectic LLM launches on his own blog), we'll briefly cover each of the three major events in roughly chronological order, then dig into some additional AI happenings this week.</p>\n<h2>Gemini Pro 1.5 general release</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Gemini-banner.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Gemini-banner-640x190.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Gemini-banner-1280x381.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Gemini-banner.png\"></a> (credit: <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemini-15-pro-in-public-preview-with-new-features.html\">Google</a>)</p></div>\n<p>On Tuesday morning Pacific time, Google <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemini-15-pro-in-public-preview-with-new-features.html\">announced</a> that its Gemini 1.5 Pro model (which we first <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/\">covered</a> in February) is now available in 180-plus countries, excluding Europe, via the Gemini API in a public preview.
