Delayed several days due to Hurricane Milton, which passed through Central Florida late last week, the launch of Europa Clipper signaled the start of a five-and-a-half- year journey to Jupiter, where the spacecraft will settle into an orbit taking it repeatedly by one of the giant planet's numerous moons.</p>\n<p>The moon of Jupiter that has most captured scientists' interest, Europa, is sheathed in ice. There's strong evidence of a global ocean of liquid water below Europa's frozen crust, and Europa Clipper is going there to determine if it has the ingredients for life.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/nasa-launches-mission-to-explore-the-frozen-frontier-of-jupiters-moon-europa/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/nasa-launches-mission-to-explore-the-frozen-frontier-of-jupiters-moon-europa/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"50fdbc7cfc0be914ea921782e824410056c3836584787b59b38549310bcddf84","category":"Tech"}
