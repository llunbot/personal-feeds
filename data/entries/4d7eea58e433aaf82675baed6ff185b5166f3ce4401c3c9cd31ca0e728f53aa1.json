Stepping out into the afternoon sun, my kit dries in about the time it takes to locate my bike – the obvious cause of my affliction. I thought riding a fixed-gear bike would give me some insight into the first Paris-Brest et Retour in 1891, the forerunner to Paris-Brest-Paris, when around 200 competitors set out from the Champs-Élysées on a mixture of safety bikes, tricycles, tandems and a lone Penny Farthing. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Ian Hands runs a club for randonneurs in honour of his dad Adrian, who completed Paris-Brest-Paris in 2003 – you have to match or beat his time of 88h 55min to join (adrianhands society.com).</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I wanted to put myself in the shoes of its inaugural winner, Charles Terront, a cycling superstar who won on a British-made Humber in the days when derailleur gears were barely a twinkle in their inventor’s eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m still fairly new to the world of fixie riding, and it’s only on this monumental ride that I have discovered one of its great drawbacks. It’s not the climbs – in PBP the climbs tend to be long and steady, and are proving very manageable – it’s the descents. Due to the lack of a freehub my pedals spin faster the more speed I pick up, and every time I find myself bouncing erratically in the saddle, pummelling my buttocks to a pulp.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The village of Le Ribay only has 500 inhabitants but offers plenty of support to the passing 6,749 participants.</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I wince as I sit back down on the narrow saddle and push away from the kerbside.

The 6,749 participants come from more than 80 countries. Among them are Americans on classic steel frames, Dutch riders in bullet-like velomobiles and a group from Malaysia on Bromptons. There are Finns and Aussies, a rider from Zimbabwe, a team of Indonesians, flag-swathed Brazilians and a trio of Germans on a triplet.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-05-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-05-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-05-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-05-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-05-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Locals young and old line the route to greet the riders as they pass.</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As our wave inches towards the start line, an animated group of Indian riders on carbon bikes prepares to sprint away. I’m scooped up by one peloton after another as we tear into the night, knowing we have just 90 hours to cover 1,219km. Constellations pinprick the sky then vanish as the sun rises. By early morning I’ve ridden my fastest ever 200km yet have barely scratched the surface.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Susilo Baskoro was one of 45 riders from Indonesia.

You need to arrive with a to-do list: 1) Park your bike and note its location. 2) Throw empty bidons into a musette. 3) Get your card stamped for proof of passage. 4) Eat as much as possible. 5) Invest some time in self-care: brush teeth, shower, snooze or stretch. 6) Get back on the road as quickly as you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easier said than done. Controls are chaotic; there are the crowds who cheer you in, long queues for food and the complexity of trying to summon up schoolboy French when you can barely remember your name. And there is the confusion of trying to find the people you plan to ride with in the melee of the bike park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approaching the 400km mark, I team up with a Japanese rider who pedals like a metronome and smiles at my <em>arigato</em> as I take over at the front. We soon find ourselves behind a diminutive Iberian dynamo who drags 30 riders along with her. I exhaust my Spanish telling her how grateful I am.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-07-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-07-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-07-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-07-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-07-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-07-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Passing through Le Ribay, where local volunteers ensure riders cross the busy RN12 safely.</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By the time we are 24 hours in, sleep deprivation is making people clumsy. Everyone has a story of seeing a rider fall asleep in the saddle then collapse into a field, ditch or hedge. Sure enough, rounding a corner we find a veteran French cyclist sprawled in the road, still clipped into his pedals. As he is helped to his feet he teeters like a new-born foal. This could be concussion. A driver pulls up and offers to help but the rider insists he’s fit to carry on. With careful coaxing, we load his bike into the car and he promises to get medical attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s midnight when the ping of a phone message tells us there are only 45 beds left at our planned sleep control. Every rider we overtake now represents another potentially free mattress, so we chase tail-lights, tearing up hills and – in my case – spinning wildly on long descents.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-08-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-08-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-08-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-08-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-08-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-08-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Participants make one last food stop before the final leg for home.</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We pass bodies in gold space blankets on the roadside and riders sleeping in steamed-up bank foyers. Both of these would have been better options as it turns out, because when we arrive at the sleep control at Carhaix (515km), the only space I can find is under a table.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Channelling Charles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 1891, Charles Terront rode the entire route without sleep. Learning that his nearest rival, Joseph Jiel-Laval, was resting in a hotel, Terront took a lengthy diversion to avoid being seen and within a matter of hours was in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-09-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-09-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-09-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-09-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-09-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-09-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-09.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>This classic event draws riders from more than 80 countries.</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With Terront as my inspiration, I peel myself off the linoleum in the middle of the night and trundle out of the control to tackle Roc’h Trevezel, a 384m climb to the highest point on the ride. Climbing on a fixie is easier at speed, and I overtake scores of riders before arriving at the summit, finding a cafe, drinking a coffee, wrapping myself in a blanket and collapsing into a deliciously deep sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I make it to Brest that morning, well within the 40-hour limit. The advice is to ‘race out and tour back’, but that doesn’t make the 50-hour return leg feel any easier as I grind through 80km of knee-hammering ascents before heat sends me scurrying for shade. The clock is ticking and I know I’ll have to make up the deficit after dark.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>We told you Le Ribay offered plenty of support. The village also supplies food, bike repairs and sleeping quarters.</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The first Paris-Brest-Paris was designed as a test of rider and machine. Michelin had convinced Terront to use innovative pneumatic tyres that could be ‘detached’, the tubes repaired, then reattached in minutes. He was plagued with punctures but the tyres – the world’s first clinchers – still gave him an advantage. His problems mysteriously stopped when he got to the front of the race, which made him suspect underhanded tactics from Jiel-Laval’s team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, there’s a far greater sense of collaboration among the riders. One new-found friend kindly drops back when I’m struggling with heat stroke. Another dashes ahead to order pizzas when we’re flagging. Cyclists I’ve never met counsel me through tough night sections. And one woman is so horrified by my appearance at a control that she gifts me the coffee she has just bought herself. It is both touching and slightly humiliating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through it all are the people who gather at all hours to cheer us on: from children with arms outstretched for high fives, their parents offering food and water, to elderly neighbours who’ve seen the event speed past their front doors over many decades. Towns are adorned with bikes and banners, and street parties go on into the night.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-11.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In the early hours of Thursday, I wake up on a patch of grass with the luxury of nine hours to cover the last 120km. I join a conveyor belt of red lights stretching ahead into the night. I’m sleep-deprived and time has lost all meaning but, as I ride into my fourth sunrise, I know I will make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Paris in sight</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Terront’s final stop in 1891 was in Versailles just 17km from the finish line, where you can find a small monument to his achievement. In Paris, police sent reinforcements to control the crowds who had gathered on the Boulevard Maillot long before sunrise. And just after 6am he rode through the Bois de Boulogne, flanked by local cyclists as the crowd cried, ‘<em>Vive Terront!</em>’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-12-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-12-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-12-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-12-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-12-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-12-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-12.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>More than 130 years later, there are echoes of that moment as the finishing line comes into view. The cheers that have carried us from one town to the next rise to a crescendo over the final 400m. And it’s the growing legion of long-distance riders around me who are Terront’s greatest legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As different as Paris-Brest-Paris is today from his 19th century voyage of discovery, this wonderfully international group of riders shares the same sense of adventure. It’s a camaraderie that has made this event the world’s greatest celebration of long-distance cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kit list</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gear up for Paris-Brest-Paris</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-13-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Paris-Brest-Paris\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-13-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-13-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-13-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-13-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-13-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/paris-brest-paris-13.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I rode this titanium Van Nicholas Yukon touring bike with gears in the 2019 Paris-Brest-Paris and had it converted to a fixed gear bike for the 2023 event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to be fully self-sufficient on the road and so, on top of inner tubes and a pump, I carried a spare tyre and an extensive tool kit. A battery pack is vital to keep computers and phone charged. Backup lighting, a change of clothing and a light bivvy bag are all worth considering. Don’t forget your toothbrush, suncream, hydration tablets and towel.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\"
