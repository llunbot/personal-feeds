We’ve tested a wide range of gravel bike tyres over the years, but these are the ones that truly impressed our test team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">Gravel riding</a> covers a broad range of ride experiences. Hard-packed dirt roads may be as smooth as pavement, rocky roads may have embedded rocks or loose gravel, and some so-called gravel rides may take cyclists onto stretches of singletrack.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of terrain out there and many different tyres to suit the varied surfaces you may encounter when you leave the tarmac. As a result, choosing the right set of tyres for your bike, and the type of riding you typically do, is key.</p>\n<p>If you’re also looking to upgrade your ride, you can check out our buyer’s guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a>, while we’ve also got a round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">best gravel wheels</a> tested by the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<h2>What to look for in a gravel tyre</h2>\n<p>When choosing gravel tyres, reflect on where you’ll be riding. Consider how much time you will spend on tarmac versus gravel or dirt.</p>\n<p>Think about how smooth or rough your roads are and what ‘gravel’ means in your neck of the woods. Smooth and fast? Rough and rutted? Rocky roads that shred fragile tyres? These are just a few of the possibilities.</p>\n<p>There’s no single right answer and tyre choice will always contain an element of compromise. Tyres suited to looser surfaces or mud will inevitably be slower when you take them on tarmac, while tyres at the lighter, slicker end of the spectrum will be out of their depth on tougher terrain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s no one tyre to suit all when it comes to gravel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilderness Trail Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-setup/\">gravel bike setup</a> will also partly dictate which tyres you can run. How much tyre clearance do you have, and what <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">wheel size</a> are you running?</p>\n<p>The width, and hence volume, will have a large impact on the ride quality, as well as the tread profile. If you intend to run a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless setup</a>, then make sure the tyres are tubeless compatible.</p>\n<p>Here are five key things to consider when choosing a set of gravel tyres. You can also read our full buyer’s guide at the end of the article.</p>\n<h3>Wheel size</h3>\n<p>Are you running 700c or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b wheels</a>? Smaller wheels will typically leave room for wider tyres if you’re limited on tyre clearance.</p>\n<h3>Tyre width</h3>\n<p>What is your preferred tyre width and hence volume? Choose wider tyres to be able to run lower pressures for greater comfort and technical capability.</p>\n<h3>Tread pattern</h3>\n<p>From a low-profile file tread or slick tyre all the way through to aggressive, mud-shedding tread with shoulder knobs, the tread pattern is probably the most important element of your tyre choice, and will be dependent on where you ride and the trail conditions.</p>\n<h3>Puncture protection</h3>\n<p>Light and supple or durable and tough? Look for extra puncture protection if you plan on heading into more remote areas on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\">bikepacking</a> trip or know you ride on surfaces that tend to wreck rubber.</p>\n<h3>Tubed or tubeless?</h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> are nearly universal in the gravel bike world now, make sure your chosen tyres are compatible with a tubeless setup before buying, if you intend to use sealant inside your tyres, rather than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tubes</a>.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>The best tyres for gravel riding in 2021, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M</strong>: £55</li>\n<li><strong>WTB Exposure</strong>: £49.99 / $59.95</li>\n<li><strong>Teravail Cannonball Light and Supple</strong>: £50</li>\n<li><strong>Continental Terra Speed/Trail TR</strong>: £60</li>\n<li><strong>Bontrager GR1 Team Issue</strong>: £49.99 / $64.99 / €49.99 / AU$79.99</li>\n<li><strong>Hutchinson Sector</strong>: £45 / $79.99</li>\n<li><strong>Maxxis Rambler EXO TR</strong>: £46.99 / $49.99 / AU$79.99</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Trigger Pro</strong>: £40 / $50 / AU$60</li>\n<li><strong>WTB Resolute</strong>: £44.99 / $59.95 / AU$69.99</li>\n<li><strong>Vittoria Terreno Dry TLR</strong>: £45</li>\n<li><strong>Schwalbe G-One R</strong>: £70</li>\n<li><strong>Michelin Power Gravel</strong>: £49</li>\n<li><strong>Donnelly X’Plor MSO</strong>: £65 /$72 </li>\n<li><strong>Kenda Flintridge Pro</strong>: £37.99 / $54.95</li>\n<li><strong>Terrene Elwood</strong>: $65</li>\n<li><strong>WTB Nano</strong>: £44.99 / $59.95</li>\n<li><strong>WTB Riddler SG2</strong>: £55</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M offers plentiful grip without feeling sluggish.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: £55 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Sizes available</strong>: 700×35, 40, 45mm and 650b x 45, 50mm</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 500g (40mm as tested)</li>\n<li><strong>Highs/lows</strong>: Super-grippy compound;

The more aggressive Trail is Conti’s grippiest gravel tyre aimed at mixed or wet conditions.

The taller tread blocks and extra shoulder grip of the Trail manage soft, wet ground far better than the Speed, which spins on anything less grippy than wet grass.

The low-profile knobs perform well on hardpack and sand over hardpacked roads.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/us/road/gear/category/components/tyres/road/product/maxxis-rambler-700-x-40c-tire-review-51364/\">Read the full Maxxis Rambler review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals for the Maxxis Rambler EXO TR</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized Trigger Pro</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Specialized Trigger Pro is a racer’s gravel tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Josh Patterson / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: £40 / $50 / AU$60 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Sizes available</strong>: 700×38mm (tested)</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 488g</li>\n<li><strong>Highs/lows: </strong>Fast rolling; very durable; slightly undersized; flat protection adds weight</li>\n<li><strong>Best for</strong>: Gravel racing and fast-paced riding</li>\n</ul><p>The Specialized Trigger Pro isn’t among the newest gravel tyres on the market, but it is a tried and true option for fast and rough gravel racing.</p>\n<p>In fact, it was developed with input from ultra-endurance gravel racers Dan Hughes and Rebecca Rusch.</p>\n<p>As one can plainly see from the tread, the Trigger Pro favours speed over traction.

While 700c wheels are pretty much standard for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bike tyres</a>, gravel bikes often use smaller-diameter 650b wheels.</p>\n<p>The main reason for using 650b wheels is to be able to run wider tyres on bikes that have limited frame and fork clearance, although the latest gravel bikes are increasingly addressing this with bigger clearances for 700c wheels.</p>\n<p>If you’re considering switching from 700c to a 650b wheelset, first make sure your bike is compatible with both wheel sizes.</p>\n<p>700c wheelsets tend to be chosen by riders who are seeking efficiency over longer rides, or ride predominantly on roads and more tame gravel tracks.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if tyre width and volume are important, a 650b wheelset might give you the option to size up when it comes to tyre choice.</p>\n<h3>Tyre width</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Use vernier calipers to accurately measure tyre width.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The width of your gravel tyres, and hence tyre volume, will make a huge difference to how your gravel bike rides. From narrow 35mm tyres all the way through to MTB-eqsue rubber measured in inches, there’s now a huge range of gravel bike tyre sizes.</p>\n<p>Your frame and fork will likely be the key limiting factor to how wide you can go: check your tyre clearances with both 700c and smaller 650b wheels.</p>\n<p>The official minimum clearance between tyre and frame/fork is 6mm to pass safety standard ISO-4210. Although you might be able to squeeze a slightly larger tyre in than recommended by the bike manufacturer, this isn’t always a good idea. You’ll reduce mud clearance and could also damage the bike if something gets trapped between the tyre and frame (for example, on the chainstays).</p>\n<p>Wider tyres will allow you to run lower tyre pressures, which can aid both grip and comfort. You’ll also increase the contact patch between the tyre and whatever surface you’re riding on.</p>\n<p>A narrower tyre will be lighter and may be faster on smoother terrain and tarmac, but there are a lot of factors at play here, including tyre pressure, tyre construction and tread pattern.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, tyre width plays an important role in how your bike rides and what it’s capable of. Consider experimenting with different widths to see what feels best for you, with your local terrain and conditions.</p>\n<h3>Tread pattern</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Choose your tread pattern according to the terrain and conditions you’ll be tackling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The tread pattern of your tyres can have a huge impact on how your gravel bike handles over different terrain.</p>\n<p>The tread typically extends to the shoulders of the tyre, and comes into contact with the ground both in a straight line and as you lean the bike through corners.</p>\n<p>Typically, you’ll find a smoother centre line for speed and efficiency, flanked by raised ribs, which may be ramped on directional treads, and with a more pronounced shoulder tread for cornering grip.</p>\n<p>Tyres designed for wetter conditions feature deeper grooves and more raised, aggressive tread, along with more widely spaced tread, which helps with mud shedding.</p>\n<p>For drier terrain, you’re likely to find a low-to-mid profile tread, or a very minimal file tread, or even slick tyres.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right tread pattern for your terrain and conditions will avoid having an excessively draggy tyre in the dry or a terrifying lack of grip in the wet.</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to mismatch treads with a grippier, more aggressive tyre up-front and a faster-rolling one on the back, as many riders do with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">best mountain bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<h3>Puncture protection</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyres with additional puncture protection should mean you spend more time riding and less time trailside fixing flats.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Look out for enhanced puncture protection when considering which gravel tyres to choose.</p>\n<p>Many tyre brands offer different options for race use, as well as more durable alternatives for general riding and bikepacking – for example, WTB’s SG2 range, Vittoria’s TNT casing or Teravail’s Durable tyres.</p>\n<p>This additional puncture protection may span the tread of the tyre, or also include the sidewalls for full bead-to-bead.</p>\n<p>This typically adds a little extra weight to the tyres (e.g. 50g in the case of WTB’s SG2 protection). However, unless you’re after the lightest tyre for gravel racing, it could save you minutes at the side of the trail trying to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-repair-tubeless-puncture/\">repair a tubeless tyre</a>.</p>\n<h3>Tubed or tubeless?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubeless tyres come highly recommended, and can easily be plugged if the sealant doesn’t do the job.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Protection from thorns, lower tyre pressures and a decreased risk of pinch punctures: the reasons for opting for a tubeless setup for off-road riding are pretty convincing.</p>\n<p>In our experience, setting up tubeless gravel tyres is also easier than ever, so it’s no surprise tubeless is the preferred option for many gravel riders. That’s the case in mountain biking, too, although road tubeless is taking longer to catch on.</p>\n<p>Almost all gravel tyres are tubeless-compatible, though it’s always worth double-checking before you buy, as well as making sure that your wheels are tubeless-compatible, if you’re making the switch from inner tubes.</p>\n<p>At the budget end, some gravel tyres and rims are still not tubeless-compatible to reduce cost, so you don’t want to get caught out there.</p>","author":"Matthew Loveridge","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"50fda5261963e050a120a0570f1f40b66fc16a589c4e90cb16602f8232e59afd","category":"Cycling"}
