{"title":"Both iPhone 16 Pro Models to Feature 256GB Base Storage, Claims Sketchy Rumor [Update: Retracted]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/both-iphone-16-pro-models-256-base-storage/","date":1713260117000,"content":"<strong>Update:</strong> <em>The Mac Observer</em> has since <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/news/editorial-mistakes-covering-rumors-at-the-mac-observer/\">retracted its article with an apology</a> and stopped collaborating with the source of the rumor, which turned out to be fake.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will allegedly offer both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max with a minimum 256GB of storage, doing away with the 128GB starting option on its smaller Pro model for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nCurrently, Apple's 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999 and comes with the minimum 128GB of storage, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 with a minimum 256GB of storage.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, according to <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-could-launch-iphone-16-pro-with-256gb-base-storage/\"><em>The Mac Observer</em></a>, Apple will bump up the base storage of the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro to 256GB to match the minimum capacity of the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the starting price of Apple's smaller Pro model will remain at $999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe source of the alleged \"leak\" has no recent track record for accurate Apple rumors, so we are filing this one under sketchy. Having said that, the claim is not outside the realm of possibility. If Apple drops 128GB as the base on the iPhone 16 Pro, that will leave three Pro storage options across the board: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-128gb-enough-iphone-storage/\">Is 128GB Enough iPhone Storage?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nIn 2018, Apple's iPhone X came with 64GB, an entry-level storage tier that persisted in successive premium device generations until the iPhone 12 Pro in 2020, when Apple adopted 128GB as the new baseline. The next year saw all iPhone 13 models offered with a minimum 128GB. If Apple makes 256GB the new minimum across its premium devices this year, we could well see it reach all models in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the other end of the scale, a rumor in January out of Korea <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/\">claimed</a> that both iPhone 16 Pro models will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro devices, increasing from 1TB to 2TB. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe maximum storage increase is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/31/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far/#\">Every iPhone 16 Rumor We've Covered So Far</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThis year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes will be the largest ever for the iPhone, and should also increase the physical space for internal components and parts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Article corrected to reflect iPhone 12 Pro jump to 128GB base storage.
