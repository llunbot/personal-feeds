Cleaning it first. Waxed chains are faster, cleaner, and easier to maintain than anything with oil-based lubes, but getting that factory grease or well-used chain lube completely off takes effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s too much effort, Kogel’s new <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=19689&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kogel.cc%2Fproducts%2Fkogel-chain-gain-coated-chains\">Gain Chains</a> are degreased and pre-waxed for you. And they say they’re good for 3% efficiency gains, whether you’re riding outside or on the trainer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gain Chains were developed with NeXT eSports team, which competes in online cycling races. They say professional e-sports teams have to double verify their data, measuring power with both crank- or pedal-based power meters and their smart trainers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1448\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-2.jpg\" alt=\"kogel pre-waxed bike chain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-2.jpg 1448w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-2-297x87.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-2-800x233.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-2-120x35.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-2-768x224.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During testing, they found that comparing watts in both places with a waxed chain yielded an improvement of 3% compared to a chain using an oil-based lube. Even better, they say that benefit scaled with power output, remaining a consistent 3% improvement even in an all-out sprint, which could mean 10-15 watts or more!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gain Chain starts out at a normal chain, then Kogel uses a multi-step degreasing process, including ultrasonic cleaning to get all of the grease out from between the pins and rollers. After that, it’s soaked in chain wax, brushed, and re-packaged for easy installation. They come in four models:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>SRAM AXS Force Flattop</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SRAM AXS RED Flattop</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shimano 12-speed Ultegra/XT (fits all Shimano road and MTB 12-speed drivetrains)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>KMC X12 for Shimano/SRAM Eagle/Campagnolo 12-speed drivetrains</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about wax flakes on my floor?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-3.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-3-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"kogel waxed bicycle chain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kogel-pre-waxed-bicycle-chains-3.jpg 1458w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, but what about wax shedding onto the floor beneath your trainer? Yep, it’ll happen, but Kogel brushes the excess off before shipping. The photo above shows a brushed chain on the left, and one fresh out of its wax bath on the right. If the gains are worth the paint, you’ll probably still wanna put a rag down under the chain, or periodically sweep away any shavings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only are they more efficient, they’ll stay cleaner for longer, reducing overall maintenance and prolonging chain life, particularly for indoor-only use. MSRP ranges from $149.99 to $174.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=19689&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kogel.cc%2Fproducts%2Fkogel-chain-gain-coated-chains\" target=\"_blank\">Kogel.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kogel-gain-chains-come-pre-waxed-for-easy-speed/\">Kogel Gain Chains Come Pre-Waxed for Easy Speed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"eb398d0ba160b449519c2a297c64d624b2a3a7483a59c2fcc2ad746a9cc6e6aa","category":"Cycling"}
