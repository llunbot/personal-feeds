Each plays on their strengths in different ways. The saddle is hyperlight, but surprisingly made for comfort. The XC Frame is unsurprisingly light, but almost half the price of Bike Ahead’s premium wheels thanks to Portuguese manufacturing. And the new top-tier 6-spoke MTB wheels are wider and lighter than ever, yet still rated for XC to downcountry…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bike Ahead Composites keep getting more advanced</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team.jpg\" alt=\"Bike Ahead The Frame lightweight affordable carbon XC hardtail made in Portugal, made by Carbon Team\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new full-carbon The Hypersaddle is hyperlight at just 70g.
