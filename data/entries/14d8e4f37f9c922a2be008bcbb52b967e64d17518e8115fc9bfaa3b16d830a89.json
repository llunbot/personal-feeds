You might have caught <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/voodoo-rigid-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">Pharris’ bike on Reader’s Rides the other day</a>. Pharris is a graduate of The Bike School.</p>\n<p>Each high school student leaves the program having learned how to fix a flat, basic wheel truing, drivetrain basics, and brake basics. On the other side of the program, Two Bikes instructors teach students how to greet a customer, how to help them find a bike that fits, and how to photograph and edit a bike to post on our e-commerce platform. Two Bikes definitely use The Radavist as an example of great bike photography.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-01.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The non-profit focuses on serving young people from underserved populations in Knoxville which not only helps the high school students, but it also helps the bike shop – and the larger cycling community in our region. When you walk into Two Bikes, the person who meets you at the door typically doesn’t look like your average bike shop employee. These young and diverse interns help Two Bikes feel more welcoming to a broader section of the population. Plus, by working with a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, races, ethnicities, genders, and sexual expressions, Two Bikes is helping create more diversity in the bike industry.</p>\n<p>Two Bikes’ goal at the nonprofit each year is to offer 40 paid internships to local high school students. The truth is the program is pretty expensive but in a lot of ways the non-profit is proud of that. They offer full benefits to the instructors and $15/hour to each of its interns. Because of this, Two Bikes are always looking for creative ways to create more job opportunities.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-22.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/The-Bike-School-21.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Two Bikes had the idea of building an auction online that would be filled with all the bike stuff that people actually want, so we reached out to as many of its friends in the bike industry as we could think of. They contacted White Industries, L39ION of LA, Appleman Bicycles, Further Bags, Simworks, Bedrock, MAAP, and so many more folks, and asked them if they would be willing to donate something to help Two Bikes create more jobs for local high school students. Two Bikes got really lucky. They basically all said yes.</p>\n<p>So if you love wrenching on bikes or riding with your friends, we’ve got a favor to ask. Could you bid on some Super Yummy tires? Or maybe an M30 crankset from White Industries? It would help share that kind of experience with a young person and hopefully teach them how rad it is to ride bikes with friends, and that the cycling community is a place where they belong.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.betterunite.com/twobikes-twobikessummercocktailsoire/auction\" target=\"_blank\">Bid at Two Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFBRcDmkvAI\" target=\"_blank\">The Nomad</a></h3>\n<p>Cory Wallace loves to combine adventure, racing and travel. The two-time Canadian Marathon winner and four-time 24hr World Champion has spent the last 16 years chasing all kinds of crazy races around the world, from Mongolia to Nepal, from Australia to Italy, and everywhere in between. A bike adventurer through and through, Cory also has a heart of gold. He weaves humanitarian efforts into everything he does, fundraising for meals and helping Nepalese cyclists raise money for a training center, as well as inspiring kids to get a taste for riding bikes wherever he travels.</p>\n<p>In mid-February Cory found himself back in Guatemala, preparing to race the El Reto, a four-day stage event in the heart of the Central American nation. In the weeks leading up to the race, Cory was joined by Matt Clark of Stirl and Rae Media Haus in the hills above Xela, deep in the country’s western highlands. Capturing the entirety of someone’s personality and interests is never easy, but Matt succeeded in portraying the essence of Cory on film. The Nomad gives us a great insight into Cory’s passions. We see Cory immersed in the local scene, connecting with the locals and riders, completely disconnected from the distractions we all face every day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZhzh7UYhRw\" target=\"_blank\">Where the Magic Happens</a></h3>\n<p>Some people ride to push their limits. Others live for the thrill. For Dakoda Tagg, riding is about connecting with his dog, aptly named Ryder. Together, they race the rocky trails of Gunnison, Colo., never more than a few yards apart. “It doesn’t matter where we’re going,” he says. “We’re just riding.”</p>\n<p>It’s hard to describe the feeling of freedom we can experience on a trail. When everything clicks, nothing should get in the way—especially not your bike. Dakoda relies on Devinci’s quiver killing Troy, whether he’s smashing laps in Crested Butte’s Bike Park or going out for an evening pedal with his dog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbSGzdethQg\" target=\"_blank\">Ultradyamico Mars Tire Review</a></h3>\n<p>Gary puts the <a href=\"https://ultradynamico.com/products/mars-race\" target=\"_blank\">Ultradynamico Mars tires</a> through the wringer on his vintage MTB…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Radavision</h3>\n<p>Stuff we see on the ‘net that causes pause…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/grandcanyon.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo and monstrosity by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvhkx0Yu0rM/\" target=\"_blank\">@johnprolly</a></em></p>\n<p>This week, President Biden established a new National Monument surrounding the Grand Canyon: Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument.</p>\n<p>According to the Grand Canyon Tribal Coalition that drafted a proposal for the monument, “Baaj Nwaavjo” means “where tribes roam” in Havasupai, and “I’tah Kukveni” translates to “our ancestral footprints” in Hopi.</p>\n<p><em>If you’d like your photo featured in our Radar Roundup posts, tag us <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theradavist/\" target=\"_blank\">on Instagram</a>!</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/radar-roundup-win-the-2023-pisgah-project-reeb-raffle-bike-litespeed-flint-affordable-titanium-gravel-bike-vancouver-pot-luck-bike-swap-two-bikes-fundraiser-the-nomad-magic-trail-dogs-and-a-l/\">Radar Roundup: Win the 2023 Pisgah Project REEB Raffle Bike, Litespeed Flint Affordable Titanium Gravel Bike, Vancouver Pot Luck + Bike Swap, Two Bikes Fundraiser, The Nomad, Magic Trail Dogs, and a Legit Ultradynamico Tire Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"14d8e4f37f9c922a2be008bcbb52b967e64d17518e8115fc9bfaa3b16d830a89","category":"Cycling"}
