Is it truly possible to write another stupid intro to BikeRadar’s most popular regular feature?</p>\n<p>Then I remember a Friday without First Look Friday would be disastrous – the earth would wobble off its axis and we’d be flung far into the coldest reaches of the universe, perishing in a bike swag-less heat death.</p>\n<p>So, for the greater good, I pull myself together, and I’m pleased to present an edition of First Look Friday snatched from the jaws of peril.</p>\n<p>If that isn’t enough, there’s been plenty else to distract you from important tasks on BikeRadar this week.</p>\n<p>To start, I was personally distressed to see an update to our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-to-weight-ratio/\">power-to-weight ratio explainer</a> appear on the homepage.</p>\n<p>This is a most unwelcome reminder hill climb season is just around the corner and I have foolishly made mumbled commitments to enter a few events this year.
