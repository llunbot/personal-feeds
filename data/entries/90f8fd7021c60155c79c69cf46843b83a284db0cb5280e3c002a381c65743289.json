Each carries a \"Retina\" marker, which Apple typically only applies to its own devices' screens.</p>\n<p>The aspect ratio for these new resolutions is very close to the current aspect ratios on the MacBook Pro computers sold today, but they're lower than what we currently see in the iMac line, suggesting that they aren't for Apple's desktops. Further, the numbers fit nicely with a move to true 2x Retina, as opposed to the scaling approach presently used for Retina displays.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798301#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798301&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"90f8fd7021c60155c79c69cf46843b83a284db0cb5280e3c002a381c65743289","category":"Tech"}
