Revamped <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020-gt-grade-reshapes-widens-groundbreaking-adventure-ready-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">five years later</a> with a bit more true Triple Triangle travel at the rear wheel, now the Grade is back in gen 3 with more focus riding further off-road. That 1st-gen Grade promised just over 10mm of travel at the rear wheel, the 2nd decoupled the seatstays for more (<em>but undefined at the time</em>) travel, and now the tweaks of this 3rd-gen Grade take it up to 30mm of ‘gravel travel’ now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, What’s New?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike.jpg\" alt=\"GT Grade new gen3 flex-suspension carbon gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos c.

Shorter seattubes conversely mean stiffer frames and less in-frame storage space, so GT kept the changes to a minimum and had to increase frame flexibility to make it all work.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors.jpg\" alt=\"GT Grade new gen3 flex-suspension carbon gravel bike, new protectors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_protectors-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Grades also get a simpler &amp;

They also significantly increased frame Reach, which likely is paired with slightly shorter stems for a modern fit on the new bike. Chainstays also actually shorten a bit, even though tire clearance grows to ~45mm, with 40 &amp; 42mm tires spec’d. The Grade is also now suspension fork compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they also took out the adjustable fork geometry flip-chip at the axle, seeing not many riders really using it. And in fact, the new Grade shifted to even more Trail (at 72mm now) than previously possible in either setting, for more all-around stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"GT Grade new gen3 flex-suspension carbon gravel bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry-297x131.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry-800x352.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry-120x53.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry-768x338.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry-1536x676.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-GT-Grade-new-gen3-flex-suspension-carbon-gravel-bike_30mm-travel_geometry-2048x901.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve also removed one size – paring the lineup down to 4 (S-XL) – keeping both the smallest &amp; largest sizes and more evenly spacing the two in between.

Most modern carbon bikes use a mix of different modulus fibers to achieve an ideal balance of weight, strength, durability, comfort &amp; affordability – GT just shed more light on how they actually spread it out. “Hi Mod where it counts” means the headtube and its junctions with the top &amp; downtubes and the BB with its junctions to the downtube &amp; chainstays all get hi-mod stiffness for optimal handling &amp; power transfer. Low modulus carbon in the middle of the toptube (where the seatstays connect), the center of the seattube (where the wheel cutout flex point is located), and throughout the flexing seatstays ensure extra compliance and flexibility. Mid-mod fibers go everywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

DFD construction though is those low-mod seatstays that are not hollow (like most carbon bikes), but are filled with flexible long-strand glass fibers that allow GT to control how the rear end can
