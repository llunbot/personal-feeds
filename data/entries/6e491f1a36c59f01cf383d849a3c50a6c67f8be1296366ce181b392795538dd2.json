{"title":"Apple Business Essentials","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-introduces-apple-business-essentials/","date":1636585806000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple today announced Apple Business Essentials, an all-new\nservice that brings together device management, 24/7 Apple\nSupport, and iCloud storage into flexible subscription plans for\nsmall businesses with up to 500 employees. The company also\nunveiled a new Apple Business Essentials app that enables\nemployees to install apps for work and request support. […]</p>\n\n<p>In addition to streamlined setup and onboarding, Apple Business\nEssentials provides a dedicated iCloud account for work, providing\nsimple and secure storage, backup, and collaboration on files and\ndocuments. Business data in iCloud is automatically stored and\nbacked up, making it easy to move between devices or upgrade to a\nnew device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fascinating. Unless I’m misreading this, Apple is entering the same market as Jamf and Kandji (editor’s note: both are previous sponsors at DF) and the other MDM companies that specialize in Apple devices. I’m curious what they mean by “backup” here, because iCloud only does backup for iOS devices. Does this program somehow back up Macs to iCloud, or is Apple just pretending  that’s not a problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Nothing magic here. It’s just like consumer iCloud, where iPhones and iPads can be backed up, and for the Mac, it’s just iCloud Drive (which, of course, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206985\">can include your Desktop and Documents folders</a>).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/10/apple-business-essentials\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6e491f1a36c59f01cf383d849a3c50a6c67f8be1296366ce181b392795538dd2","category":"Tech"}
