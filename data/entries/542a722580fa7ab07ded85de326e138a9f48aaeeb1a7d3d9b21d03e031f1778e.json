Pick from the adventure Yasei or race Sensei, with a couple of affordable ti frames that cover a broad spectrum from all-road to bikepacking off-road. We had the chance to spend several weeks test riding the pre-production prototype Yasei this summer. And now it’s available to the public…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Equator titanium gravel bikes born from affordable wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei.jpg\" alt=\"Equator Yasei titanium affordable gravel bike review, fast-packing light bikepacking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_lightweight-backpacking-with-Yasei-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For more than a decade, <a href=\"https://equator-cycling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Equator</a> delivered top quality <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-bike-czech-custom-carbon-favorit-f3-cyclo-cross-cx-national-champion-pavla-havlikova/\" target=\"_blank\">affordable direct-to-consumer carbon wheels</a> around central Europe, produced in a close development partnership with Taiwanese carbon powerhouse Gigantex. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the leap to making bikes grew out of a passion project on the guy behind the growth of the wheel brand. Jan Habich like to ride gravel. He wanted to develop his own bike. And he wanted to bring that same Equator mix of performance &amp; consumer accessibility to a premium gravel bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s the difference between the Yasei &amp; Sensei?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, Sensei vs. Yasei\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei-297x107.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei-800x288.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei-120x43.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei-768x276.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-vs-Yasei-1536x553.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Equator)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The resulting Equator titanium gravel bike project ended up with a bit of an internal squabble at the company. Some wanted a performance-focused gravel bike that could do double duty as an all-road bike or a fast gravel bike. And the other half wanted an ‘all-purpose-vehicle’ that leaned more towards adventure, bikepacking, and riding further off-road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they made both. And figured they would let customers decide which they preferred.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, Sensei all-road fast gravel bike, non-driveside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-all-road-build-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sensei is the performance gravel bike, with more road leaning geometry, 1x or 2x , and clearance for up to 700c x 47mm tires.

A T47 threaded bottom bracket, a UDH universal derailleur hanger, flat mount disc brakes, 12mm thru-axles, and a 31.6mm seatpost with internal routing for a dropper. Plus, a little bonus chain hanger above the driveside dropout for cleaner transport with the wheel removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset.jpg\" alt=\"Equator Yasei titanium affordable gravel bike review, tapered headtube &amp; adjustable headset angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_tapered-headtube-angle-adjust-headset-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both also share the same tapered headtube fitted with an external Cane Creek Angleset headset that lets the end buyer customize the geometry to their preference from -1.5° to + 1.5° in 1/2 a degree steps. And they each get their own discipline appropriate full carbon forks. The Yasei adventure fork includes flush Anything cage mounts, plus a flip-chip at the dropout to adjust the rake between 47 or 52mm offset for consistent loaded or unloaded handling, or just to tune your ideal ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-frame-set-left.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-frame-set-left.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, Sensei frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-frame-set-left.jpg 1333w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-frame-set-left-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-frame-set-left-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-frame-set-left-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Sensei-frame-set-left-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sensei gets a sensible amount of attachment points. Two sets of cage mounts inside the main triangle, a direct mount for a toptube bag, and a pair of cage bosses under the downtube just in front of the BB.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes,\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_yasei-frame-set-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the Yasei takes it to the next level for adventure, adding of course the fork Anything cage mounts, and turning that mount under the downtube into a 3-bolt Anything cage mounts. You also get rear rack mounts and separate tabs for full-coverage fenders front &amp; rear. (It will not include the anything cage mounts that were on the prototype I tested, due to clearance issues while pedaling.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What else is new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking.jpg\" alt=\"Equator Yasei titanium affordable gravel bike review, forest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_fast-packing-loaded-bikepacking-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond what I saw and tested in these 2 prototypes, Equator has further refined the titanium gravel bikes that you will actually buy with a few more improvements. Maybe the biggest in my mind based on my feedback to them, will be smaller diameter size-specific butted seatstays for improved rider comfort. The early prototype I rode still had 19mm stays and was quite a bit stiffer than it needed to be. But production bikes scale back to 16mm for small &amp; medium and 17mm for large &amp; XL frames, to further benefit from that classic smooth ti ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_new-headtube-internal-routing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_new-headtube-internal-routing.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, new cable routing port sample detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_new-headtube-internal-routing.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_new-headtube-internal-routing-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_new-headtube-internal-routing-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_new-headtube-internal-routing-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_new-headtube-internal-routing-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frames you order today now also get a new unified port (<em>similar to this routing port example</em>) on the side of the headtube for cleaner internal cable routing without frame rub. Fewer holes in the frame is always better, right? Rear derailleur cable routing also now comes out directly from the end of the chainstay which is a cleaner look (and better structurally). Plus, you won’t see it if you build up a wireless shifting bike. /</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also both now get a 3-pack of cage mounts on the downtube.

Weighing in at 10.44kg complete with a dropper post and pedals, it isn’t exactly light. But I’ve ridden multiple <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-merida-silex-versatile-gravel-bike/\">cheaper</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/3t-extrema-italia-carbon-29er-adventure-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">more expensive</a> new carbon gravel bikes around 10.1kg this summer, so it’s not really bad either for a metal bike that should last forever. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Test riding the adventure-ready Equator Yasei titanium gravel </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails.jpg\" alt=\"Equator Yasei titanium affordable gravel bike review, riding trails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_riding-down-MTB-trails-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I rode it all over my local dirt &amp; gravel roads, plenty of singletrack, and one bigger light bikepacking trip across a couple of Czech mountains. Most importantly, Equator were very open and welcoming to my feedback, and specifically addressed my one primary concern. And even corrected a small nit that I picked before the bikes went into production. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the prototype arrived to me, I was quite happy with the fit and feel of the bike. The mid-long Reach and low Stack supported a nice aggressive position on the bike. But you could always set it up a bit more relaxed if you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking.jpg\" alt=\"Equator Yasei titanium affordable gravel bike review, touring\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-Yasei-titanium-affordable-gravel-bike-review_summer-fastpacking-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry-wise, the bike has quite a long wheelbase which lent great all-surface stability. But with the 70° headtube, the ride still felt quick, even with the big knobby 44mm Raddler tires. I only rode the fork flip-chip in the forward-most 52mm offset position, with its lower Trail setting. I never felt the need for extra stability. But I also didn’t have time to play with the adjustable angle headset. In the end though, I really appreciate the adjustability (without too much extra complexity). And if it was my personal bike, I would experiment with which setting I like best for my riding terrain. And then set it and forget it there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There definitely feels like enough adjustability, that I would pick this over the Sensei, because of the flexibility that comes with the extra tire clearance. Even for more of a fast gravel setup with fast-rolling 40mm tires, the Yasei is still a solid bet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What that means though, is that buyers would probably pick the Sensei for more all-road-specific riding. Or a tiny bit of weight savings. Or for someone just looking for a more conventional road fit with lower Stack &amp; shorter Reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Updates based on my prototype testing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end.jpg\" alt=\"Equator Yasei titanium affordable gravel bike review, stiff rear end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_stiff-rear-end-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So my only real concern was rear end stiffness. With 19mm seatstays on the prototype Yasei, I felt a bit beat up after riding all-day on chunky gravel and rougher mountain bike trails. So, Equator revised the rear end. They swapped in much more forgiving 16 or 17mm butted chainstays that will likely go a long way to filtering out rough gravel buzz. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_flattened-top-tube-oval.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_flattened-top-tube-oval.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, new flattened toptube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_flattened-top-tube-oval.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_flattened-top-tube-oval-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_flattened-top-tube-oval-800x320.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_flattened-top-tube-oval-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_flattened-top-tube-oval-768x307.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Equator)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And to match that, they shifted to a 1cm flattened top tube for a bit more give. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have NOT ridden the updated bike yet (maybe next spring). But Equator assures me that both the new Yasei &amp; Sensei that went into production with these tube shaping updated are noticeably more comfortable, while not sacrificing any of the excellent handling stiffness that I experienced.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, revised bottle cage mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_2-position-water-bottle-mount-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Equator)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And that last nit I picked? I felt that the Anything cage mounts were located too high on the downtube. I had to use a Fidlock setup to fit a bottle under my frame bag. So they shifted the mounts down. The upper pair of bolts stay where I had my bottle, but now there will be one hole lower. If you want just one bottle then, you can get it lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Equator Yasei &amp; Sensei titanium gravel – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, Yasei &amp; Sensei complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_all-road-or-adventure-bikepacking-options-1536x768.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically both the new Equator Yasei &amp; Sensei titanium gravel bike framesets are available now in a made-to-order pre-order scheme. To order one now you pay 50% up front, and the remainder a couple of months later when they arrive. But… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equator does also plan to keep a number of S/M/L frames in stock starting later this month. So you won’t necessarily have to wait long if you get one of their limited stock. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Equator's new affordable consumer-direct titanium gravel bikes, Yasei frame detail non-driveside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Equator-affordable-consumer-direct-titanium-gravel-bikes_Yasei-frameset-non-driveside-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both framesets officially retail for 2440€.
