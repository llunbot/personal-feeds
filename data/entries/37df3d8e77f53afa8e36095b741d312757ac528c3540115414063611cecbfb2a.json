I’ve combined years of research and the \ndiligent collection of unique comics printing artifacts with \ndozens of interviews with cartoonists, historians, and \nproduction people to tell the story of how a comic starts with \nan artist’s hand, and makes it way through transformations into \nprint and, more recently, onto a digital screen. I need your \nhelp to make it happen! </p>\n\n<p>The book will be a glorious full-color celebration of the art \nform, heavily illustrated from the 1890s to the present day with \nmaterials that you’ve never seen before, drawn from my personal \ncollection and museums, cartoonists and their estates, and \ninstitutions around the United States. It will also feature \nnever-before-published strips and versions of some popular comics. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m a sucker for labor-of-love books, and remain fascinated by the history of printing technology. So of course I’m backing Fleishman’s Kickstarter campaign. But I’ll bet a lot of you might share the same interest.
