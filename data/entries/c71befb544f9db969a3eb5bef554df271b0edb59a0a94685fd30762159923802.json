The sun is just about to sink behind turn two of the Herne Hill track, painting a band of pinks, purples and oranges across a cloudless sky. The organisers have gotten lucky. Had it been held on almost any other week this summer, the South London Grand Prix – the first UCI meet to be held here in nearly a decade – would be taking place under a blanket of grey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it is, conditions are perfect for bike racing. Although the evening session is still to kick off, it’s already standing room only around the 450m circuit. There’s no spare spectating space to be found against the fence, and in places the crowd is three deep.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 146: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/the-world-cycling-revival-gears-up-for-herne-hill-velodrome-to-the-delight-of-local-riders\">The World Cycling Revival gears up for Herne Hill Velodrome to the delight of local riders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/herne-hill-velodrome-re-opens-following-the-last-phase-of-refurbishment\">Herne Hill Velodrome re-opens following the last phase of refurbishment</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Around the back of the clubhouse, bike parking is at capacity. Inside at the bar, they’ve already run out of Herne Hill Track Session IPA at least twice. The aroma of oil-drum jerk chicken draws hungry punters towards the food stand – until they see the queue, which stretches almost as far as Burbage Road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There wasn’t any Caribbean food on offer when the Olympic cycling events were held here in 1948, although HMS Empire Windrush had arrived at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica some six weeks prior. They didn’t have junior events 75 years ago either, and there was no space for women cyclists to compete at all. Thankfully, it’s all very different today.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Waugh / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Today’s race meeting marks three-quarters of a century since the 1948 London Olympics, the first to be held after the Second World War, and it has welcomed a special guest of honour: 94-year-old Jim Love (see bottom of article). Love was a reserve member of the British Olympic team pursuit squad that won bronze, and is the only person here today who witnessed the 1948 event first-hand. He has travelled from Southampton to be here with members of his family, and also the families of several of his old teammates, including the daughter of mercurial sprinter Reg Harris.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When the Olympics came to Herne Hill</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 1948, Harris was a star of British track racing, but he wasn’t very taken with Herne Hill, which caused problems with the sport’s governing body. Less than a week before the cycling events were due to start, newspapers up and down the country carried word of the world sprint champion’s exclusion from the British squad for refusing to return from Macclesfield for training at the Olympic track.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Waugh / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Harris was unrepentant. ‘Either I do things my way or not at all,’ he told the <em>Daily Mirror</em>. ‘Training at Herne Hill was doing me no good. Unless I can train with my own lads here, on the ground I’ve used for 16 years, I can’t get the Olympic form. If the worst comes, I’ll sit in the stands and watch the events.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris ended up getting his way. After presenting his case at a three-hour meeting of the National Cyclists’ Union (NCU, a precursor to British Cycling), the committee reversed its decision. Celebrity status and the sheer force of his personality was not enough to bring home the gold, however. Although Harris made it to the final, he was beaten in straight rides by Italy’s Mario Ghella, an accountancy student from Turin.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Waugh / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Harris had to settle for another silver in the tandem, after he and his Manchester Wheelers teammate, Alan Bannister, were again bested by the Italians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was so dark that only a handful of the 14,000 people present saw the greatest finish of the whole Olympic cycling programme,’ reported one newspaper, ‘with Italy scraping home by the width of a tyre.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I thought we’d got it,’ said Harris afterwards. ‘It is a pity it was too dark for a photo finish.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Floodlights mean the racing can continue into the night for the crowd to enjoy – unlike in 1948, when the British tandem pair lost the gold medal race to the Italians in a dramatic finish that most spectators missed because it was so dark.</figcaption><figcaption>Geoff Waugh / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Despite the lack of floodlights, Herne Hill was actually one of the few Olympic venues that had been refurbished prior to the Games, the track and its surrounding buildings having been badly damaged during the War. As well as repairs to the racing surface, spectator accommodation was increased by the creation of a permanent stand along with temporary seating erected on the back straight. Two public bars served 16,150 ‘light refreshments’, 13,400 ‘beverages’ and 12,200 ‘ices’ over the three days of competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To provide for the press, 12 phone boxes were installed, while the BBC built its own stand and control room. Luxuries for the athletes themselves were limited. With no Olympic village, the riders shared digs just round the corner, at 58 Half Moon Lane, where they slept on army-issue trestle beds in the servants’ quarters of the house. Rationing, though gradually being relaxed, was still in place. The mother of pursuitist Tommy Godwin came to cook for them.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Waugh / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When the pursuit events came around, however, it proved disappointing for Love’s teammates. Despite breaking the record for the fastest 4,000m recorded on the Herne Hill track – a time of 4min 59sec, which would look respectable against the best of today – and riding ‘brilliantly’ in the opening heats, disorganisation cost them against France in the semi-final. Wilf Waters went out too hard, causing the quartet to briefly break up, and leaving them with too much to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Three score and 15 years on</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today racing can finally take place at Herne Hill after dark. The floodlights were installed in 2013 as an essential phase of the Save the Velodrome operation after it was threatened with closure in the early part of the millennium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The track also boasts a flashy new pavilion, built in 2017, although all the investment in refurbishing the venue doesn’t seem to be reflected in the price of a ticket.

All the same, to qualify for UCI Class 2 race status – the same as meets such as the Dublin Track International and Grand Prix Poland – regulations require a minimum of three participating nations in each race. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The action on track is relentless and excellent value at just £10 – not much more than the three shillings six pence (£6 today) spectators paid at the 1948 Games.</figcaption><figcaption>Geoff Waugh / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The South London Grand Prix manages that with five Irish riders, three Dutch, a Ukrainian, New Zealander Emma Cummings and Wednesday night track league regular George Nemilostivijs, who originally hails from Latvia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sprinter Deirbhle Ivory, from Wicklow, is here at the invitation of Herne Hill’s events manager Katherine Potsides, who crossed the Irish Sea in May to see how they did things in Dublin.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Geoff Waugh / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And for Ivory the SE24 event draws favourable comparisons: ‘To have this kind of atmosphere in an outdoor track setting is really cool to see.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final sprint for the line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ivory speaks highly of the standard of the field, too.

In his first time-trial – a ‘25’ – he recorded a time of 1h 19min 54sec. Within three years he had taken almost 20 minutes off that and started the 1948 season as an Olympic ‘possible’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 7th July, Love was upgraded by the NCU to ‘probable’ and eight days later received official notification of his inclusion in the six-rider squad. When training or competing at Herne Hill he would ride across town, ‘carrying my racing bike on my shoulder with the saddle just behind my ear, and the frame over my shoulders. We had to watch out for trams,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-13-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Herne Hill 75 years\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-13-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-13-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-13-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-13-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-13-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/herne-hill-75-years-13.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Final selection for the pursuit team did not occur until days before the competition, after Love had received his race number (152) and embroidered badge. Ultimately, he didn’t make the foursome that took Bronze at the Olympics, a decision that came down simply to performance. On 4th August, three days before the event, the team was told to go all-out in training at Herne Hill. Love was dropped midway through the session, later noting that he was ‘slightly off form’ that day.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/herne-hill-olympics\">75 years later: Marking Herne Hill velodrome’s Olympic anniversary</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c71befb544f9db969a3eb5bef554df271b0edb59a0a94685fd30762159923802","category":"Cycling"}
