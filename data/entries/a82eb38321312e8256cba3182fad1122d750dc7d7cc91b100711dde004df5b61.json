{"title":"Why incels take the “Blackpill”—and why we should care","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/why-incels-take-the-blackpill-and-why-we-should-care/","date":1748629841000,"content":"<p>The online incel (\"involuntary celibate\") subculture is mostly known for its extreme rhetoric, primarily against women, sometimes erupting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Isla_Vista_killings\">into violence</a>. But a growing number of self-identified incels are using their ideology as an excuse for not working or studying. This could constitute a kind of coping mechanism to make sense of their failures—not just in romantic relationships but also in education and employment, according to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gwao.13248\">a paper</a> published in the journal Gender, Work, &amp; Organization.</p>\n<p>Contrary to how it's often portrayed, the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere\">manosphere,</a>\" as it is often called, is not a monolith. Those who embrace the \"Redpill\" ideology, for example, might insist that women control the \"sexual marketplace\" and are only interested in ultramasculine \"Chads.\" They champion self-improvement as a means to make themselves more masculine and successful, and hence (they believe) more attractive to women—or at least better able to manipulate women.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the \"Blackpilled\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel\">incel</a> contingent is generally more nihilistic. These individuals reject the Redpill notion of alpha-male masculinity and the accompanying focus on self-improvement. They believe that dating and social success are entirely determined by one's looks and/or genetics. Since there is nothing they can do to improve their chances with women or their lot in life, why even bother?</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/why-incels-take-the-blackpill-and-why-we-should-care/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/why-incels-take-the-blackpill-and-why-we-should-care/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a82eb38321312e8256cba3182fad1122d750dc7d7cc91b100711dde004df5b61","category":"Tech"}
