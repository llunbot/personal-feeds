Its trademark kinked top tube is almost as iconic as the riders that pilot it. Mathieu van der Poel, Puck Pieterse, Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado, Zoe Bäckstedt, and Maghalie Rochette are just a few that call the Canyon Inflite home.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon Inflite CFR\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Canyon thought the Inflite CFR could use a little tweaking and modernization; with these changes, the Inflite CFR will look slightly different this ‘cross-season, but only to the keen-eyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full-.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon Inflite CFR Full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full-.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full--297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full--800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full--120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full--768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full--400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Full--1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Inflite CFR — What’s New?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The design is very close to the bike that took Mathieu van der Poel to victory at the 2023 Cyclocross World Championships. The update was so subtle, it was hard to notice. The new Caynon Inflite CFR models now come with clean internal cable routing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Inflite carbon cross bike, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-Canyon-Inflite-carbon-cross-bike_angled.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Last years’ Canyon Inflite CFR </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous model routed the brake hose and shifting wire/cable through a post on the fork and side of the headtube. The updated version sees internal cable routing similar to the Aeroad and Endurace.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem--800x472.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon Inflite CFR Aero Stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem--800x472.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem--297x175.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem--120x71.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem--768x453.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the internal routing, the updated version of the Canyon Inflite CFR will use Canyons CP0018 aero cockpits with 40 mm width adjustments. Now, riders can choose their bar width and experiment with others without a day for labor. Another performance extra comes in the form of Ceramic Speed bottom brackets. The performance-oriented brand will supply the bottom brackets on the newly updated line of Canyon Inflite CFR cyclocross bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"MvdP NFT.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MvdP-NFT-1657139241.4736.jpg 1000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>What does this mean for performance?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The internal routing looks excellent and should help (slightly) with shouldering and cleanliness of the bike. Maintenance, however, will take slightly longer than previously. Though super clean looking, the internals of the CP0018 will take extra time to switch out headset bearings, something fairly common for ‘cross racers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Canyon knows this and must believe the upgrade is worth it for the top-end racers. Those racers with a team of mechanics that tear down and rebuild race bikes daily will make quick work of it. However, those without a service course might be in for extra service charges when the headset needs a change.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-inside-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"590\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-inside--800x590.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon Inflite CFR Aero Stem inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-inside--800x590.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-inside--297x219.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-inside--120x89.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-inside--768x566.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Canyon-Inflite-CFR-Aero-Stem-inside-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Aero Cockpit </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the cockpit, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unique-canyon-aerocockpit-on-new-aeroad-offers-unprecedented-cockpit-adjustability-packability/\">CP0018</a> was overhauled after some incidents in major road races and looks sturdy.
