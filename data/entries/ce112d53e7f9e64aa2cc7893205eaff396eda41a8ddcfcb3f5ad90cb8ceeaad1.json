But we're spoiled for choice now. How much you enjoy <a href=\"https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2\"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em></a> (for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation and releasing on September 9) will depend on your ability to tap into the deep basement of your kill-'em-all mentality and fantasy lore engagement. You can enjoy it somewhat ironically, which I did at times, especially when playing co-op with friends who told me that they did not like the game's aesthetics at all. But strip away the grimdark trappings of zealotry, Chaos Marines, and skulls—so, so many skulls—and you have a competent, sometimes innovative third-person squad shooter. It feels like <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/gears-of-war-5-hands-on-a-new-blockbuster-for-the-game-subscription-era/\">Gears of War</a>, </em>minus the cover, but with heavier characters, more melee combat, and somehow even fewer women.</p>\n<p>Getting the most out of <em>Space Marine 2 </em>means suspending disbelief, feeling heavy metal, and wanting to kill a whole bunch of things with some very big dudes. In roughly a dozen hours of gameplay, I found the core gameplay loop relatively engaging, with enough mix-ups, upgrades, and challenges to keep it feeling more like the fun kind of endless war, not the real kind. It's pretty enjoyable to team up with friends, too, so long as they're cool with <em>Warhammer 40K's </em>vibes and some occasionally repetitive challenges.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047067#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047067&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce112d53e7f9e64aa2cc7893205eaff396eda41a8ddcfcb3f5ad90cb8ceeaad1","category":"Tech"}
