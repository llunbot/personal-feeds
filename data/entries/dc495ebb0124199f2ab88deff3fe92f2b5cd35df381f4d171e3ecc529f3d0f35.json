Samsung Display is also purportedly developing an 11-inch OLED panel for a future <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> model planned for launch next year, suggesting that it could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/06/samsung-lg-preparing-for-oled-ipads-report/\">take a share</a> of the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ orders from LG.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple apparently plans to sequentially introduce new ‌iPad Pro‌, MacBook Pro, and ‌MacBook Air‌ models with OLED displays. <em>The Elec</em> is unsure when the OLED ‌MacBook Air‌ will be released, but suggests it could be around two years away due to Apple's product development timescales. Display analyst Ross Young has previously said that he expects a ‌MacBook Air‌ with an OLED panel to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/12/oled-macbook-air-ipad-pro-2024/\">launch as soon as 2024</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is believed that Apple originally wanted Samsung Display to supply a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/ipad-air-first-apple-device-to-gain-oled-display/\">10.86-inch OLED panel for a future iPad Air</a> model, which would have been its first OLED ‌iPad‌, before the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/02/kuo-apple-cancels-ipad-air-plans-2022/\">project was scrapped</a> due to the single stack panel's price and quantity issues, as well as concerns around the need to differentiate the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> from the ‌iPad Pro‌. Apple is now said to have moved to a more reliable two-stack OLED panel that is expected to debut on the ‌iPad Pro‌ next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>The Elec</em> also claims that the project to develop an 13.3-inch OLED panel for a ‌MacBook Air‌ is also effectively a test for mass production of OLED panels for future MacBook Pro models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/oled-macbook-air-now-in-development/\">OLED MacBook Air Reportedly Now in Development as Apple Plans to Bring New Display Technology to Multiple Product Lines</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-macbook-air-reportedly-now-in-development-as-apple-plans-to-bring-new-display-technology-to-multiple-product-lines.2385326/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dc495ebb0124199f2ab88deff3fe92f2b5cd35df381f4d171e3ecc529f3d0f35","category":"Apple"}
