This comes on the same day that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-purchase/\">started selling the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID on a standalone basis</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/mac-pro-new-graphics.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs noted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jake31Krol/status/1422561959896100874\"><em>CNN Underscored</em>'s Jake Krol</a>, the Mac Pro can now be configured with new AMD Radeon Pro W6800X, W6800X Duo, or W6900X graphics when ordering the professional workstation <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-pro\">through Apple's online store</a>. The new options come at steep prices, ranging from $2,400 for a single W6800X module to $11,600 for two W6900X modules.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's descriptions of the graphics modules:<blockquote><strong>AMD Radeon Pro W6800X</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nFor workstation-class graphics and demanding pro applications, choose the AMD Radeon Pro W6800X with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth. This graphics option features AMD’s RDNA2 architecture, delivering up to 16.0 teraflops of single-precision or 32.0 teraflops of half-precision computing. It supports up to six 4K displays, three 5K displays, or three Pro Display XDRs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe full-height MPX Module fills an MPX bay and uses extra power and PCIe bandwidth to deliver four additional Thunderbolt 3 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port on the card. You can install two W6800X MPX Modules in your Mac Pro and connect them using Infinity Fabric Link for enhanced multi-GPU performance in applications like Final Cut Pro. When you select the option with two GPUs, the Infinity Fabric Link connector comes preinstalled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>AMD Radeon Pro W6900X</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nFor the maximum workstation-class graphics and demanding pro applications, choose the AMD Radeon Pro W6900X with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth. This graphics option features AMD’s RDNA2 architecture, delivering up to 22.2 teraflops of single-precision or 44.4 teraflops of half-precision computing.

The module has two W6800X GPUs, each with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth. The two GPUs are connected onboard with Infinity Fabric Link, and two W6800X Duo modules can be bridged to allow four W6800X GPUs to communicate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInstall two modules in your Mac Pro for intensive tasks like GPU rendering or advanced color grading. Get up to 30.2 teraflops of single-precision or 60.4 teraflops of half-precision computing. The Radeon Pro W6800X Duo MPX Module supports up to eight 4K displays, four 5K displays, or six Pro Display XDRs. And the full-height MPX Module fills an MPX bay and uses extra power and PCIe bandwidth to deliver four additional Thunderbolt 3 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port on the card. When you select the option with two GPUs, the Infinity Fabric Link connector comes preinstalled.</blockquote>For customers who already purchased a Mac Pro, Krol said the new graphics modules will also be available on a standalone basis through Apple's online store, but the product listings have yet to go live, so pricing remains to be seen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>These should deliver some big performance boosts like up to 23% faster performance in DaVinci Resolve and 84% faster in Octane X.
