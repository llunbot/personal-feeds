{"title":"Garmin HRM-200 In-Depth Review","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-hrm-depth-review.html","date":1736164833000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>Garmin has just announced their HRM-200 chest strap, a product designed to be their affordable chest strap option, for scenarios that might not work as well with an optical HR sensor. But perhaps more interesting, is that it’s the first of likely many Garmin product refreshes that are aimed at complying with upcoming EU regulations on authentication and encryption requirements (<a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/the-begining-of-the-end-for-ant-wireless.html\">the same ones that just started the death of ANT+ on Friday</a>).</p>\n<p>So, while it does ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart transmission like every other product on the market, it also carries with it the ability to encrypt your heart rate data stream, as well as provide authentication. I’m not aware of any other standalone heart rate sensor on the market that does both of those today, and certainly none from Garmin.</p>\n<p>Fear not though, all of that is optional today. So if you just want an accurate and dependable chest strap at a reasonable price, this delivers, no extra complexity required. And, of course, in this review, I’m going to walk through how it works after using it for all of my workouts for a while now. That’ll cover the basics, as well as all the advanced bits, and of course, a look at heart rate accuracy.</p>\n<p>Lastly, this is a media loaner from Garmin. I’ll shortly go out and buy my own for long-term usage purposes, then return this existing one. As always, I don’t accept advertising from any company I review, and no company sees my reviews before you do.

That said, there frankly isn’t a lot of end-user difference here once you get it paired up. It’ll transmit your heart rate to the app of your choice over ANT+ or Bluetooth Smart, just like the HRM-DUAL did. The key differences are really within the pod design and new ‘Secure’ transmission modes.</p>\n<p>In any case, here are those differences:</p>\n<p>– Changed battery compartment design to comply with various kid-proof coin cell battery laws (Australia, US, etc…)<br />\n– Added clever ’tool’ to strap, to open said battery compartment without requiring another tool (e.g., screwdriver, etc…)<br />\n– Added status LED to front of pod<br />\n– Added button to front of pod for changing modes<br />\n– Added ability to switch between ‘Open’ (unsecured) and ’Secure’ (encrypted) transmission<br />\n– Added one extra channel of Bluetooth (thus unlimited concurrent ANT+ connections and 3 concurrent Bluetooth connections)<br />\n– Now offered in two sizes: XS-S and M-XL<br />\n– Same 3ATM/30m water resistance rating<br />\n– Same removable CR2032 coin cell battery + 1 year battery life<br />\n– Price is $79USD</p>\n<p>At a high level, the key differences between the HRM-200 and the HRM-PRO/PRO-PLUS/HRM-FIT series are:</p>\n<p>– HRM-200 doesn’t transmit additional Running Dynamic metrics (that your watch can mostly do these days without a strap anyway)<br />\n– HRM-200 doesn’t have offline saving features (to save data such as during swimming or football if a watch/app isn’t nearby)<br />\n– HRM-200 doesn’t transmit running pace/distance data indoors (or outdoors)<br />\n– HRM-200 doesn’t do offline capture of Garmin stats like Intensity Minutes, Steps, or Calories (when watch isn’t worn), something the others can do<br />\n– HRM-200 has a 3ATM (30m) water resistance level, versus 5ATM (50m) water resistance level. Practically speaking, that won’t matter since the HRM-200 doesn’t save HR data underwater (nor transmit through water), even if you were to use it diving to 30m or less<br />\n– HRM-200 is 63g, the HRM-PRO Plus is 52g. The HRM-200 is 11mm thick, and the HRM-PRO Plus is 8.6mm thick.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, all of the other core technology is the same as those straps/sensors.

Given this is a relatively simple/straightforward product, I’ll try and keep things as brief as possible.</p>\n<h3><strong>Daily Usage:</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM-200-DailyUsage.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-DailyUsage.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM 200 DailyUsage.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-DailyUsage-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-DailyUsage-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-DailyUsage-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-DailyUsage-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>The first thing to know about the product is that it comes in two sizes, a smaller size for smaller chests, and a larger size for larger chests. Of course, that’s just the strap portion. There are two portions to the product, the strap and the pod. Obviously, the pod comes in the box – but you can always buy a secondary strap down the road. Here’s the sizing chart:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span><strong>XS-S:</strong></span></p>\n<p>Strap length: 22″–28″ (56–72 cm)<br />\nFits chest size 23.5-33.5” (60-85cm)</p>\n<p><span><strong>M-XL:</strong></span></p>\n<p>Strap length: 28″–42″ (72–106 cm)<br />\nFits chest size 31.5-47”(80-119cm)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The split pod/strap design is not new to Garmin, or heart rate straps. Garmin has used the pod design for many years. However, you will notice the new LED light, which is the first time Garmin has had an LED or button on their strap.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-SplitPodDesign.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SplitPodDesign.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 SplitPodDesign.\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SplitPodDesign.jpg 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SplitPodDesign-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SplitPodDesign-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SplitPodDesign-300x200.jpg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SplitPodDesign-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>Flipping the pod over, you’ll see the battery compartment. Said compartment complies with various newish laws in both Australia and the United States that require a tool design when a coin cell battery is involved (to ensure kids don’t swallow the coin cell/button batteries).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM-200-CloseUpPod.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-CloseUpPod.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM 200 CloseUpPod.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-CloseUpPod-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-CloseUpPod-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-CloseUpPod-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM-200-CloseUpPod-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>However, what’s incredibly clever here, is that the tool is built into the strap design. If you look at the clasp, you’ll see it has two little protrusions on it:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-StrapDesign.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-StrapDesign.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 StrapDesign.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-StrapDesign-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-StrapDesign-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-StrapDesign-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-StrapDesign-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>These bump-outs perfectly fit into the battery compartment notches, allowing you to rotate it and open it up. This rotation does require a fair amount of force, actually, quite a bit of force in fact – especially the first time. Closing it is easy though. I gave it to both my 7 and 8-year-old daughters to see if they could open it up, neither came anywhere near close to opening it. Thus, it’d be beyond impossible for a 2-year-old. Kudos Garmin, super clever.</p>\n<p>Once opened, you’ll find a CR2032 battery inside, which should last roughly a year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-CR2032Battery.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-CR2032Battery.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 CR2032Battery.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-CR2032Battery-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-CR2032Battery-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-CR2032Battery-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-CR2032Battery-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, after closing it back up, it’s time to get it paired up.</p>\n<p>At product launch (here in January 2025), the unit ships by default in ‘Open’ mode. This means by default it does not require encryption, nor authentication to see your heart rate. For newer Garmin devices however, it will require you hold the button down for 4 seconds to enter pairing mode, which is indicated by a blinking orange icon:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing1.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing1.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 OpenPairing1.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing1-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing1-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing1-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>What’s kinda quirky about this, is that for older unaware Garmin devices, no pairing mode is needed. Same goes for literally every other device on the planet. But Garmin (or their lawyers) are in effect holding themselves to a higher standard by requiring you enter pairing mode to make you aware that the data is unencrypted/open. Whereas for all other devices out there, you don’t need to put it in pairing mode at all, just simply put it on your chest to wake up, and then search for the strap within the device.</p>\n<p>Once in pairing mode, you can open up whatever watch/app/bike computer/Peloton bike/etc…. you have, and search for a heart rate sensor, it’ll find it on both ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart. It’s always transmitting concurrently (there’s negligible battery difference to keeping both signal types open).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing2.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing2.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 OpenPairing2.\" width=\"235\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing2.jpg 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing2-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing2-300x200.jpg 300w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing3.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing3.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 OpenPairing3.\" width=\"235\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing3.jpg 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing3-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing3-300x200.jpg 300w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing4.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing4.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 OpenPairing4.\" width=\"235\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing4.jpg 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing4-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing4-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>On a newer Garmin unit though, at this point it’ll make you aware of the ability to use an encrypted session instead.

Further, it lists this as Open, versus ‘Secure’. You can toggle between ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart, though it’ll give you a warning. That warning is because in some scenarios, notably a Garmin HRM-PRO series strap, there’s additional data not delivered via Bluetooth Smart (e.g. Running Efficiency metrics). But for this more basic strap it doesn’t have that data.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing11.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing11.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 OpenPairing11.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing11-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing11-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing11-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-OpenPairing11-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>In any case, with all that set (which really only takes a few seconds), you’ll see your heart rate data on whatever device you have.

This is all at the device/app layer though, and really doesn’t have anything to do with the strap per se.

However, the Polar pod does fit on the Garmin strap without issue. Below, the Garmin HRM-200 pod on the Polar H10 strap:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"PolarStrapGarminHRM200Pod.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/PolarStrapGarminHRM200Pod.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/PolarStrapGarminHRM200Pod-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/PolarStrapGarminHRM200Pod-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/PolarStrapGarminHRM200Pod-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/PolarStrapGarminHRM200Pod-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Again, just keep to the respective straps/pods on each company, and you’ll be good.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Authenticated &amp; Encrypted Mode:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-Encrypted.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Encrypted.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 Encrypted.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Encrypted-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Encrypted-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Encrypted-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Encrypted-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest new features on the HRM-200 is the ability to authenticate and encrypt your heart rate data. That’s because upcoming European Union regulations require that a user be aware when they are sending personal information out in the open unencrypted. We’ll set aside the fact that literally zero people have ever asked for encrypted live heart rate data in a gym, but alas, this was sorta collateral damage for more important wireless communications that might occur from your phone to the internet. In the eyes of this regulation, all wireless things are treated the same. Thus, here we are (keeping in mind that Garmin unquestionably hates this as much as anyone else, they’re literally throwing away <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/the-begining-of-the-end-for-ant-wireless.html\">ANT+ long term because of it</a>).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, at some point it’s likely Garmin will start shipping the HRM-200 in ‘Secure’ mode, versus ‘Open’ mode. But Garmin did note they have no intention of removing ANT+ from this strap. It’s here to stay.</p>\n<p>So that gets us to the ‘Secure’ mode. There are essentially two modes for the heart rate strap:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span><strong>Open Mode:</strong></span> This transmits in both ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart like every other HR strap on the market for the past two decades. Your data is not encrypted.<br />\n<span><strong>Secure Mode:</strong></span> This transmits only in Bluetooth Smart, and requires you manually go into pairing mode to start a pairing connection, and then encrypt all data sent between the strap and receiver devices (e.g., watch, bike computer, phone app, etc…).</p></blockquote>\n<p>To switch from Open Mode to Secure Mode, you simply double-tap the button, which will then change the blink pattern. Here’s the entire chart of the blinking patterns.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM-200-LED-Lights.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-LED-Lights.png\" alt=\"HRM 200 LED Lights.\" width=\"719\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-LED-Lights.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-LED-Lights-200x129.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-LED-Lights-720x465.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>At first glance, it’s a bit overwhelming, but honestly, once you do it once, all you really care about is:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Two blinks:</strong> Secure mode<br />\n<strong>Three blinks:</strong> Open Mode<br />\n<strong>Constant blinks:</strong> Pairing mode (long-hold 4 seconds to start)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sure, there are some other error-checking type options and firmware update lights, but frankly, you won’t run into them in day-to-day operation, but for completeness, here they are:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM-200-FactoryResetFirmwareUpdate.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-FactoryResetFirmwareUpdate.png\" alt=\"HRM 200 FactoryResetFirmwareUpdate.\" width=\"718\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-FactoryResetFirmwareUpdate.png 1436w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-FactoryResetFirmwareUpdate-200x78.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-FactoryResetFirmwareUpdate-720x282.png 720w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM-200-ErrorSet1.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-ErrorSet1.png\" alt=\"HRM 200 ErrorSet1.\" width=\"720\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-ErrorSet1.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-ErrorSet1-200x90.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM-200-ErrorSet1-720x325.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, so let’s get back to our pairing. In this case, I’ve double-tapped to switch into Secure mode, and then I long-held for four seconds to start pairing mode. After which, I started searching for external HR monitors:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing1.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 SecurePairing1.\" width=\"235\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing1-1.jpg 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing1-1-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing1-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing2.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing2-1.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 SecurePairing2.\" width=\"235\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing2-1.jpg 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing2-1-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing2-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing3.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing3.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 SecurePairing3.\" width=\"235\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing3.jpg 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing3-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing3-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Note that at present, in current Garmin watch/bike computer firmware, if you want to switch from Open to Secure mode, you need to remove the ‘Open’ pairing on your watch and re-pair back in ‘Secure’ mode.

If you were to look at the sensor pairings this time, you’ll see it just lists it as a Bluetooth connection only, and as a ’Secure’ connection. I would have thought a lock icon would be displayed here (akin to the unlock icon above), but this is also still beta firmware on Garmin’s watches, so perhaps that’ll come.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing7.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing7-1.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 SecurePairing7.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing7-1-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing7-1-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing7-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-SecurePairing7-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>You’ll see in the sensor settings that it’s a Bluetooth (BLE) connection now, but otherwise, the data is exactly the same on your watch/bike computer – just a simple heart rate value.</p>\n<p>Of course, in secure mode at present, that’s really only Garmin doing it. Polar and Google Pixel watches do some rebroadcasting transmission bits with authentication, but it’s unclear to me if that signal is also encrypted. And Google can’t pair to an external heart rate strap. I did try to pair it to the Polar Vantage M3 in Secure mode. While the watch reported success during the pairing process, the strap quickly gave an error LED. Despite that, the watch thinks it can connect to the HRM200 just fine, but only shows 30BPM as a constant value forever (this is the value it’ll show to any device that thinks it has a secure pairing, but doesn’t actually have an authenticated connection).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_2484.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2484.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2484.jpg 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2484-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2484-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2484-300x200.jpg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2484-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>To be very clear (again), once I go back into ‘Open’ mode, it works just fine with the Polar devices. I really want to keep repeating this: Using it in normal ‘Open’ mode is the same as every other HR strap from the last decade or two. It’s no different here.</p>\n<p>Finally, since I’m probably talking to more geeky people at this point in the review, the HRM-200 transmits HRV in the same way as past Garmin chest straps, on both ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart. You can see this in apps like HRV Logger:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_7988.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7988.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7988.png 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7988-200x433.png 200w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_7991.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7991.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7991.png 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7991-200x433.png 200w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_7993.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7993.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7993.png 470w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_7993-200x433.png 200w\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, with all that set, let’s take a quick look at heart rate accuracy.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Heart Rate Accuracy:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-Accuracy.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Accuracy.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 Accuracy.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Accuracy-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Accuracy-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Accuracy-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Accuracy-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>While many may associate chest straps with the gold standard of accuracy, that’s not always the case. In fact, in cooler times of the year (typically fall, or a warmer day in winter), chest straps actually struggle more than optical HR sensors, notably during the first few minutes of exercise, when you might not have any sweat yet. Further, in some cases, like the Wahoo TICKR series, it would eventually be susceptible to longer-term failures resulting in all assortment of bad things.</p>\n<p>Thus, I test all heart rate sensors equally. In doing so I’m comparing the sensor (be it chest strap, optical HR sensor, ear sensor, etc…) to other ‘known good’ devices. And while every heart rate sensor can have a bad moment (yes, even the Polar H10), if you wear enough sensors at the same time, you can typically figure out which is the odd duck out. Thus, for my testing period, all of my workouts had the following setup:</p>\n<p>1) Garmin HRM-200<br />\n2) Polar H10 or Garmin HRM-PRO Plus<br />\n3) Polar Verity Sense (optical HR sensor)<br />\n4) COROS HR Sensor (optical HR sensor)<br />\n5) Whoop 4.0 Band<br />\n6) Watch A: Usually a Garmin Fenix 8<br />\n7) Watch B: Usually an Apple Watch Ultra 2</p>\n<p>Yes, that’s a stupid amount of data. Thus, in some of the charts I’ll try and simplify it, just for clarity purposes. I also had the AmazFit T-Rex 3 in the mix too, here and there. Some of the above sensors could do internal storage of the data (e.g. Polar Verity Sensors), others were paired to watches or bike computers to record the data, and finally, others were paired to phone apps to record the data.</p>\n<p>With that, let’s take a look at a few different workouts across different sport types. First up, we’ve got an interval run. These were longer 12-minute intervals, but fun nonetheless. In this case, I had an assortment of other sensors, though no secondary chest strap (the app I was recording on…sigh…failed). In any event, <a href=\"https://analyze.dcrainmaker.com/#/public/a03a4f09-404d-4e7c-7ccc-b8242febde54\">here we go</a>:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM200-Run1-Wide.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Run1-Wide.png\" alt=\"HRM200 Run1 Wide.\" width=\"719\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Run1-Wide.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Run1-Wide-200x95.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Run1-Wide-720x341.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, they were all virtually identical. Some slight variations from the AmazFit T-Rex 3 at the beginning due to colder temps, but otherwise everyone else for the next 90 minutes just had fun as one cohesive HR party.</p>\n<p>Next, we’ve got some hill repeats. These are always interesting for chest sensors and optical HR sensors alike. Sometimes you can get so-called ‘cadence lock’ when going downhill. Typically that impacts optical HR sensors more than chest sensors, but there’s a long history of chest straps falling victim to this concept (which is basically that the thunk of your footsteps is so prominent it tricks HR sensors into thinking it’s your heart rate).</p>\n<p>And of course, on the uphill part, we get to test how quickly the heart rate rises. In any event, here it is compared to an <a href=\"https://analyze.dcrainmaker.com/#/public/b828b8d9-511f-44bf-71ef-d77d74b76da1\">absolute boatload of concurrent sensors</a>:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM200-HillRepeats.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-HillRepeats.png\" alt=\"HRM200 HillRepeats.\" width=\"719\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-HillRepeats.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-HillRepeats-200x91.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-HillRepeats-720x328.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, only the Whoop 4 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 displayed issues. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 was lagging on some of the intervals (uphill), sometimes quite considerably, though it didn’t have any issues on the downhill portions.</p>\n<p>Next, let’s look at one of a number of different indoor trainer rides. Well, technically, it was an outdoor trainer ride. But either way, it was stationary (and cold). Here it is compared to that same <a href=\"https://analyze.dcrainmaker.com/#/public/d42ac5ea-1a6a-47d5-7f8a-2f0861ef40b9\">huge slate of secondary sensors</a>:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM200-Indoor2hrRide.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Indoor2hrRide.png\" alt=\"HRM200 Indoor2hrRide.\" width=\"719\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Indoor2hrRide.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Indoor2hrRide-200x93.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-Indoor2hrRide-720x333.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>There’s really no need to analyze this further, everyone is in complete agreement throughout all of these intervals over the course of nearly 2 hours. The only one that briefly disagreed was the Whoop 4.0 band, and only just briefly.</p>\n<p>Next, another indoor trainer ride, this one with some substantial longer-term intensity, before a bit of an easy descent within Zwift. Here’s that data:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM200-TrainerRideZwift.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-TrainerRideZwift.png\" alt=\"HRM200 TrainerRideZwift.\" width=\"719\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-TrainerRideZwift.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-TrainerRideZwift-200x93.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-TrainerRideZwift-720x334.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, only some slight differences from the Whoop 4 again, and one Apple Watch Ultra 2 hiccup.</p>\n<p>Now, before we head outdoors, here’s a slate of different devices all recording from the same HRM-200. I’ve got two different Garmin bike computers (via ANT+), and then also Zwift via Bluetooth. I did this on most of my rides, each time with different devices. No difference:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM200-MultiDevice.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-MultiDevice.png\" alt=\"HRM200 MultiDevice.\" width=\"720\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-MultiDevice.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-MultiDevice-200x79.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-MultiDevice-720x284.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>The goal of the above is to validate there aren’t any drop-out issues, or signal issues with multiple connections.</p>\n<p>Ok, finally, an outdoor ride. This had some flats, some descents, some ups, all in an effort to see how well things handled. Again, chest straps can often have issues in cooler weather (which this was) with just a light jersey (as I was wearing), in terms of accuracy. Here’s <a href=\"https://analyze.dcrainmaker.com/#/public/817c52a5-bef7-4d38-404e-c3e1397176c7\">that data</a>:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"HRM200-OutDoorRide.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-OutDoorRide.png\" alt=\"HRM200 OutDoorRide.\" width=\"719\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-OutDoorRide.png 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-OutDoorRide-200x89.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/HRM200-OutDoorRide-720x320.png 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Here we don’t really see any difference between the two chest straps, nor any errors on the initial descents compared to other sensors. The Polar Verity Sense did struggle in the beginning though on the initial warm-up period, but then seemed fine after that. The Fenix 8 occasionally struggled early on as well. This time the Apple Watch Ultra 2 didn’t struggle.</p>\n<p>Lastly, some of you might ask about swimming usage. Because the HRM-200 does not store data (whereas the HRM-PRO/HRM-FIT does), it’s not useful in swimming. That’s compounded by the fact that digital signals like ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart can only go about 1”/3cm in water before being blocked. Whereas older 5 kHz analog signals (like older Polar straps) can actually transmit through water to much older Polar watches. Though no current/recent Polar watch supports those signals.</p>\n<p><em>(Note: All of the charts in these accuracy sections were created using the DCR Analyzer tool. It allows you to compare power meters/trainers, heart rate, cadence, speed/pace, GPS tracks, and plenty more. You can use it as well for your own gadget comparisons, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/analyzer\">more details here</a>.)</em></p>\n<h3><span><strong>Heart Rate Strap Comparison:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>I’ll likely do a separate post comparing the options here, but essentially I see three comparison sets. The first is within the Garmin range, which is as follows:</p>\n<p>– HRM-DUAL (being replaced by HRM-200) at $59<br />\n– HRM-200 (this review) at $79<br />\n– HRM-PRO Plus at ~$100<br />\n– HRM-FIT (for women) at ~$150</p>\n<p>Basically, the key differences between the HRM-DUAL and HRM-200 is the authentication/encryption piece at the software layer, and then the different pod design (including safer coin cell battery compartment if kids are around). Beyond that, essentially same-same. Whereas on the HRM-PRO Plus and HRM-FIT level, you’re paying for all the added features I outlined in the first section. Those features are pretty much *ONLY* useful if you’re in the Garmin ecosystem with a Garmin watch, and even then, have debatable value for 95% of the people.</p>\n<p>Then the second category comparison is the more general heart rate strap/mainstream options. There are, of course, countless generic ANT+/Bluetooth smart heart rate straps out there, often for quite cheap. But among the bigger tech companies doing HR straps, some of the most popular comparative options are (current real-world Amazon pricing, as these all stay pretty constant):</p>\n<p>– Garmin HRM-200 at $79<br />\n– <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wahoo-TRACKR-Heart-Rate-Monitor/dp/B0D52P8XS1?crid=9AWZNPTD7H9Z&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gWvewRH9szI20Ncmwk1ynrCaKtEtNR9XhvUb5zdamy_MJ6It_s0WVL7NcY5tLbgZJb9wgVf4qsXea2vITNv7DkMsLmOtS1EC-lIYIR5vyG_0V3xvRBpjoQueRvZqnhIUxsDtQxWhaOBbCoZ_VxItibnKdUteYDok8Hdh3940H7yRbBO-GwqzS_2KgHxplPHkVhLl9SZfM2T_KlVjQjG5-PccyEf6mzR7zNCpgbMXmGM.zLfl8pZpAtiCS45BJXeExw2t-jTuaLladRb0Tbn6plc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=wahoo%2Btrackr&amp;qid=1736118146&amp;sprefix=wah%2Btrackr%2Caps%2C247&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=6de270be93f4071176ccbbe85a634994&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Wahoo TRACKR at $89</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/POLAR-Heart-Rate-Sensor-Waterproof/dp/B08411DQ96?crid=TS908RAT1P1I&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iLh_SizVCI91-THijkB5z-6-DJZE8k1ov70Sjn25KzB9aTgYnrkf-aOhqyA3FE8THHaSD9duHCXvFpcfECF_3riOS-4hz_HDgxp2r0ThAffQHVxpem6CPl4nzck0Yc5VJjHXAx0IBsl3Ey3FvHbJelssSjlR1qOMG5gAST96vApdYn061i1WnkbZPtlW9q0EvyVUI-2J6Bk0Dsconz7LkUhuNF91mikb-0h2URcsmgs.oMQT0uNVTocFIxggnum4C9MgL51QDHHCtHLm1YJTkVc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=polar%2Bh9&amp;qid=1736118095&amp;sprefix=polar%2Bh9%2Caps%2C272&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=c75845437068ecacb4dce4a7fd618a42&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Polar H9 at ~$56</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Polar-Heart-Rate-Monitor-Women/dp/B07PM54P4N?crid=TS908RAT1P1I&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iLh_SizVCI91-THijkB5z-6-DJZE8k1ov70Sjn25KzB9aTgYnrkf-aOhqyA3FE8THHaSD9duHCXvFpcfECF_3riOS-4hz_HDgxp2r0ThAffQHVxpem6CPl4nzck0Yc5VJjHXAx0IBsl3Ey3FvHbJelssSjlR1qOMG5gAST96vApdYn061i1WnkbZPtlW9q0EvyVUI-2J6Bk0Dsconz7LkUhuNF91mikb-0h2URcsmgs.oMQT0uNVTocFIxggnum4C9MgL51QDHHCtHLm1YJTkVc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=polar%2Bh9&amp;qid=1736118095&amp;sprefix=polar%2Bh9%2Caps%2C272&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=eaf36e022c91db4a8ef1c9295845528a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Polar H10 at ~$85</a></p>\n<p>You can see these below, though the Polar H9/10 are visually near identical:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-PolarH10Wahoo-Tracker.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-PolarH10Wahoo-Tracker.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 PolarH10Wahoo Tracker.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-PolarH10Wahoo-Tracker-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-PolarH10Wahoo-Tracker-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-PolarH10Wahoo-Tracker-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-PolarH10Wahoo-Tracker-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>At this level, I’d struggle to see why you’d buy the Wahoo TRACKR, a strap that when it launched I was worried it was slightly overpriced with a proprietaryish connector, and now even moreso with the Garmin HRM-200 being far better in terms of future-proofing. As far as the Polar H9/10 goes, for 99% of the population, the Polar H9 is the best option. It does dual ANT+/Bluetooth Smart, though it doesn’t have the offline data feature of the H10 (which is frankly finicky to use anyway).</p>\n<p>Again, there are other cheaper random options out there, but these are the ones I have the most familiarity with. I’ll do a deeper dive though in the coming weeks.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>Wrap-Up:</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Garmin-HRM200-Secure.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Secure.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin HRM200 Secure.\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Secure.jpg 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Secure-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Secure-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Secure-300x200.jpg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Garmin-HRM200-Secure-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>The Garmin HRM-200 is kinda a sleeper agent of a product. At the surface, it’s basically just a refresh of the now 6-year-old Garmin HRM-DUAL strap, keeping up with the times. For most people, you’d never notice the difference – it works exactly as advertised with minimal fuss. It’s easy to recommend, because it works easily and is at a price point that’s logical (Garmin often charges a substantial premium for things, but this isn’t one of those things).</p>\n<p>But as the photo above notes, it’s got quite a bit more under the covers to make it more future-proof. It also very clearly spells out Garmin’s likely roadmap for sensor refreshes for a chunk of this year. Garmin’s recent Forerunner/Fenix/Edge/etc beta programs easily show that the secure connectivity pieces is an important piece of the company’s future, even if it’s purely driven by lawyers and regulatory requirements. As a result, Garmin has positioned itself as really the first major (if not only) heart rate sensor that’s compliant. But it also likely illuminates the path for higher-end Garmin HR sensors. After all, Garmin can’t easily add a physical button (which complies with the human ‘authorization’ component) to their existing HRM-PRO Plus (which will be 2 years old this summer). Nor can it do it for the HRM-FIT. Same goes for coin cell battery compliance. Both will undoubtedly require refreshes.</p>\n<p>But setting that aside, if you’re looking for a reasonably priced heart rate strap that works well across every Garmin and non-Garmin device I’ve tested it with, the HRM-200 is an easy future-proofed option that’s hard to find fault with.</p>\n<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p><div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
