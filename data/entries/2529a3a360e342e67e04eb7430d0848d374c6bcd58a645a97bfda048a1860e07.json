And they start with the wild and revolutionary aerodynamic carbon Pinarello Espada that Miguel Induráin rode to an Hour Record thirty years ago this week, on the velodrome in Bordeaux, France. It was a bike unlike anything that came before it. And it laid the foundation for both the carbon fiber construction and aero focus that dominates almost all modern performance bikes these days, across all disciplinefs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tale of the Pinarello Espada’s development quickly drew me in, and can’t wait to see what comes next…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>‘Fausto Talks’</em> Documentary Series on iconic Pinarello bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Espada story is a compelling and emotional one. Sit back and let Pinarello’s President, and son of the bikemaker’s founder Fausto Pinarello tell how the bike came to be. It was a watershed moment for the brand. And the for then 33-year-old Fausto who had shifted from his role in finishing Pinarello bikes to a leadership role securing pro sponsorships, and just lured Induráin’s Banesto team back onto Pinarello bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-jpg.webp\" alt=\"'Fausto Talks' Documentary Series on iconic Pinarello bikes, rideable prototype Espada made of an aluminum frame with plaster covering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-about-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_prototype-Pinarello-Espada-made-of-plaster-over-an-alloy-structure-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Pinarello)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Espada developed so quickly as the Pinarello team ran with the idea to create a truly innovative bike – bringing in outside experts for their first wind tunnel testing, complete aero-led design, and first-ever carbon frame. From the first welded aluminum prototype in the wind tunnel to a rideable plaster mockup to the final carbon bike that Induráin would ride 53.040km (32.958mi) in one hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-jpg.webp\" alt=\"'Fausto Talks' Documentary Series on iconic Pinarello bikes, Miguel Indurain sets 1994 Hour Record on prototype Pinarello Espada\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fausto-Talks-Documentary-Series-on-iconic-Pinarello-bikes_Miguel-Indurain-Hour-Record-on-prototype-Pinarello-Espada-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, the story of Induráin’s wild Pinarello Espada Hour Record bike is only the 1st of 6 that will complete the ‘Fausto Talks’ series.
