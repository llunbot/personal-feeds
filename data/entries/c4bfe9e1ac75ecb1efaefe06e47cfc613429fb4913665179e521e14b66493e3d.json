Now that's all a thing of the past, thanks to Strava's new in-app media widget.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter starting recording an activity, users can tap a music icon in the top-right corner of the Strava interface and connect their Spotify account, after which it's possible to browse content in the Spotify widget and choose what to play. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe integration supports music, podcasts, and audiobooks, and users can swipe through the queue to see what's next, as well as browse through custom-made and popular Spotify-made playlists.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Spotify widget can be used by both paying and non-paying Spotify users. Free Spotify users can shuffle albums/playlists/artists, but will not be able to pick specific songs, and will hear intermittent ads. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile Spotify premium users can select specific songs in their albums and playlists, but doing things like shuffling settings, queuing up specific songs, and using search can only be done in the Spotify app proper.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/strava/\">Strava</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/strava-spotify-integration-music-playback/\">You Can Now Control Spotify Media Playback Within the Strava App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-control-spotify-media-playback-within-the-strava-app.2386592/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c4bfe9e1ac75ecb1efaefe06e47cfc613429fb4913665179e521e14b66493e3d","category":"Apple"}
