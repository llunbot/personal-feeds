There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's April 23, and today's photo comes from the Hubble Space Telescope. It features a lovely, barred spiral galaxy and a photobombing star on the right-hand side of the image.</p>\n<p>The galaxy is NGC 3783, which can be found 130 million light-years away from Earth. Astronomical distances are all mind-boggling, but to try to put things into perspective, that means this galaxy is about 1,000 times the distance farther from us compared to the diameter of our own Milky Way Galaxy. So it's far, far away.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019243#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019243&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f630e38ce5a685179960ee55bb605897687d837ff44e230cf173b484c4a64e23","category":"Tech"}
