That's a $90 discount off of the original $599 price tag for that machine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is selling a range of ‌Mac mini‌ models with various RAM, Ethernet, and SSD upgrades, but all of the available models have the ‌M2‌ chip, with no ‌M2‌ Pro options for sale at this time. The lower prices come in at around 15 percent off, with the biggest discounts available on pricier machines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌M2‌ ‌Mac mini‌ models came out in January 2023, replacing the prior <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> and Intel ‌Mac mini‌ options. There have been no external updates to the ‌Mac mini‌, with Apple instead focusing on internal upgrades that include the ‌M2‌ chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRefurbished products from Apple are almost identical to new devices, with each one undergoing a refurbishment process that includes full functionality testing, blemish-free external enclosures, and more. Refurbished products are eligible for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a>+ and have the same 14-day return period as new Apple devices.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/refurbished-m2-mac-mini/\">Apple Now Selling Refurbished 2023 M2 Mac Mini Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-2023-m2-mac-mini-models.2390435/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4972a087525bbd2e3ad72fd8f114cc1afb2774d5bfc19e1e0a12984949dfa46f","category":"Apple"}
