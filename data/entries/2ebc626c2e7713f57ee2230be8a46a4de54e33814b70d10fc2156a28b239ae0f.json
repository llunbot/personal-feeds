The sixth assessment report cycle saw its first documents released in 2018, and five more followed through 2022. Today puts a coda on that cycle, as the condensed <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/ar6-syr/\">Synthesis Report</a> is out.</p>\n<p>The first three reports were focused on narrow topics: the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/heres-what-it-would-take-to-stop-climate-change-sooner/\">1.5°C warming</a> milestone, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/new-ipcc-report-shows-land-use-is-part-of-solution-to-climate-change/\">land use</a> and climate change, and the world’s <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/heres-what-it-would-take-to-stop-climate-change-sooner/\">oceans and ice</a>. The next three followed the traditional structure of previous assessment reports: the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/new-ipcc-climate-report-is-the-clearest-guidebook-for-selecting-a-future/\">physical science</a> of climate change, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/if-adapting-to-climate-change-sounds-easy-it-shouldnt/\">impacts</a> of climate change, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/04/ipcc-report-the-next-few-years-are-critical/\">solutions</a>.</p>\n<p>Each of these reports is meant to represent the state of scientific knowledge on a topic so decision-makers and other interested readers don’t have to take on the many thousands of published studies that form their foundation. The role of the Synthesis Report is to further distill the most important information into the simplest reference that the scientists can bear to put their stamp of approval on. The 18 key conclusions in this report provide an impressively comprehensive yet succinct description of our situation—the ultimate TL;DR of Earth’s climate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925160#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925160&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scott K.
