From <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/doom-doom-ii-is-a-great-excuse-to-jump-back-into-hell-for-free-or-for-10/\">the ’90s originals</a> to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/\">series’ resurrection</a> in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/\">recent years</a>, the Doom games have always been about using constant, zippy motion to dodge through a sea of relatively slow-moving bullets, maintaining your distance while firing back at encroaching hordes of varied monsters. The specific guns and movement options you could call on might change from game to game, but the basic rhythm of that dodge-and-shoot gameplay never has.</p>\n<p>Just a few minutes in, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> throws out that traditional <i>Doom</i> rhythm almost completely. The introduction of a crucial shield adds a whole suite of new verbs to the Doom vocabulary; in addition to running, dodging, and shooting, you’ll now be blocking, parrying, and stunning enemies for counterattacks. In previous Doom games, standing still for any length of time often led to instant death. In <i>The Dark Ages</i>, standing your ground to absorb and/or deflect incoming enemy attacks is practically required at many points.</p>\n<p>During <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/\">a preview event earlier this year</a>, the game’s developers likened this change to the difference between flying a fighter jet and piloting a tank. That’s a pretty apt metaphor, and it's not exactly an unwelcome change for a series that might be in need of a shake-up. But it only works if you go in ready to play like a tank and not like the fighter jet that has been synonymous with Doom for decades.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-review-shields-up/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-review-shields-up/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0acb0a46fb1f43fd9da8c741a14a70b8acbdcb4054f36eb068fabbf09ec4b4a8","category":"Tech"}
