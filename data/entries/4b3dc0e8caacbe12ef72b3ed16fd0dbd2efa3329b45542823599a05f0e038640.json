{"title":"iPad Mini 6: All of the Rumors So Far","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6/","date":1630607493000,"content":"The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> has been largely the same since it was first introduced in 2012. It's had the same thick bezels and Home button across all five of its refreshes, but that's set to change with the debut of the ‌iPad mini‌ 6.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iPad-mini-pro-feature-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Design</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-mini-redesign-coming-2021/\">nix the Home button</a> and adopt a design that's similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/\">larger edge-to-edge display</a> with slimmed down bezels <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/14/kuo-apple-glasses-2022-new-ipads-2020/\">that measures in</a> at somewhere around 8.3 to 9 inches.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith no Home button, the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 is expected to get the same <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">Touch ID power button</a> as the ‌iPad Air‌, but it's not yet clear whether it will get a USB-C port or continue to use Lightning. It could also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ipad-mini-6-a15-chip-and-smart-connector/\">include a Smart Connector</a> for use with accessories like the Magic Keyboard.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBased on a case maker's mockup <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/alleged-cutout-of-sixth-generation-ipad-mini/\">that leaked in August</a>, the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 could have volume buttons located at the top of the tablet rather than at the right side, which would be a major design change.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ipad-mini-6-cutout.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Renders</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nLeaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">shared renders</a> of what the ‌iPad mini‌ will allegedly look like. It features an edge-to-edge display and a USB-C port.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/ipad-mini-6-bottom.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nProsser says that the ‌iPad mini‌ will measure in at 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, and he claims that it will come with a new, smaller <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/ipad-mini-6.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Processor</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nRumors suggest the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">will feature</a> an A14 chip, which is the chip that's used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Mini-LED Display?</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nBack in 2020, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/\">was working on</a> an ‌iPad mini‌ with an LED display, a device he expected to launch late in the year. That didn't happen, and mini-LED rumors died down until <em>DigiTimes</em> said in July 2021 that the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/ipad-mini-with-mini-led-display-rumor/\">would feature</a> a mini-LED display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<span>Unfortunately, display analyst Ross Young believes <em>DigiTimes</em>' information is inaccurate, and he says that the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/ipad-mini-mini-led-display-analyst/\">will not include</a> a mini-LED display, which perhaps makes sense because right now, mini-LED is limited to the highest-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> model and the ‌iPad mini‌ is offered at a much more affordable price tag.</span>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYoung said that he spoke to Radiant Opto-Electronics, the supplier that <em>DigiTimes</em> claimed would be manufacturing the display. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a> technology would allow for thinner and lighter product designs while also offering good wide color gamut performance, high contrast and HDR, and local dimming, which dims the backlight behind black areas of the screen while keeping bright parts lit.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPad mini‌ 6 is set to be released this fall, but a specific launch date hasn't been nailed down yet. Apple is going to hold an event in September to unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> and the Apple Watch Series 7, but the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 is likely to come later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is expected to hold multiple fall events this year, so we could see the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 in October or November.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6/\">iPad Mini 6: All of the Rumors So Far</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-6-all-of-the-rumors-so-far.2309545/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v0LGfFACStY:G-Jefe11d6c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v0LGfFACStY:G-Jefe11d6c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/v0LGfFACStY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4b3dc0e8caacbe12ef72b3ed16fd0dbd2efa3329b45542823599a05f0e038640","category":"Apple"}
