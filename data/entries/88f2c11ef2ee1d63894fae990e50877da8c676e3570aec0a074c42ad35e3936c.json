The OS got its first Patch Tuesday update earlier this week, and now another update is rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Beta and Release Preview channels. ItÂ <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/\">fixes a long list of early problems</a> with the new operating system.</p>\n\n<p>The headliner here is a fix for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-bug-could-reduce-ryzen-cpu-performance-by-up-to-15-amd-says/\">a problem affecting L3 cache latency on AMD Ryzen processors</a>, which according to AMD can reduce performance by between 3 and 5 percent. The Windows 11 update released earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723998/windows-11-update-amd-ryzen-cpu-performance-worse\">may have actually made the problem worse</a>, but at least a fix is imminent.</p>\n<p>The L3 latency bug is one of a pair of problems that AMD identified with Windows 11 earlier this month. The other Windows 11 problem AMD identified, which can prevent high-core-count, high-wattage Ryzen chips from correctly assigning work to the processor's fastest individual cores, will be fixed via an AMD driver update.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804570#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804570&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"88f2c11ef2ee1d63894fae990e50877da8c676e3570aec0a074c42ad35e3936c","category":"Tech"}
