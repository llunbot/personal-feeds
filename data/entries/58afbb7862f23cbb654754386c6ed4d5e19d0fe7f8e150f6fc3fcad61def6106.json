Now Apple TV has dropped the full official trailer, and it looks like we're definitely in for an all-out war between the ruling Cleons and the titular Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/lee-paces-brother-day-is-front-and-center-in-first-teaser-for-foundation-s2/\">previously reported</a>, Asimov's fundamental narrative arc remains intact, with the series taking place across multiple planets over 1,000 years and featuring a huge cast of characters. The biggest change from the books is the replacement of the Empire's ruling committee with a trio of Eternal Emperor clones called the Cleonsâ€”a genetic dynasty. Brother Day (Lee Pace) is the primary ruler, with Brother Dusk (Terrence Mann) serving in an advisory/legacy role. Meanwhile, Brother Dawn (played as a child by Cooper Carter and as a teenager by Cassian Bilton) is being groomed to take over as the new Brother Day. Technically, they are all perfect incarnations of the same man, at different ages, and this is both the source of their strength as a team and of their conflicts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947347#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947347&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58afbb7862f23cbb654754386c6ed4d5e19d0fe7f8e150f6fc3fcad61def6106","category":"Tech"}
