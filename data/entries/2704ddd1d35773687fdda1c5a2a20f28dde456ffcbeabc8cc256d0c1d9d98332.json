The Firebird was revised from the ground up to offer slacker steering, a steeper seat mast, a lower BB, and a more planted suspension feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the frame refinements, Pivot offers a lot of adjustability on the new Firebirds. The bike has both geometry and suspension progressivity flip-chips, two chainstay length settings, and oversized head tubes that allow for reach or angle adjust headsets. Pivot also sells all models with either 29” or MX wheelsets (with the exception of XS frames).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wide lineup of 2025 Firebird models range from mid-spec to very high-end, with options including Fox Live Valve Neo Coil shocks and wireless dropper posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Pivot Firebird – Frame Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, rear angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-rear-angle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All models of the 2025 Firebird are built on carbon frames. Each frame size gets its own carbon layup and strength-to-weight analysis to ensure every rider experiences Pivot’s intended ride characteristics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Firebird offers 165mm of rear travel, driven by a DW linkage. Its kinematics and linkage were revised for 2025 to enhance the bike’s capabilities on rough terrain while maintaining excellent pedaling efficiency. All models come equipped with 170mm Fox 38 forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivot gives most riders the choice of 29” or MX wheels. All Firebird models in sizes S-XL can be purchased with either wheel configuration; however, size XS frames are offered with MX wheels only as they cannot fit a 29” rear wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, shock progressivity flip-chip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-suspension-flip-chip-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond wheel size options, Pivot has incorporated a lot of adjustability into the Firebird frame. First off, it includes a Suspension Progressivity Flip-Chip to tune the shock curve to your preference. The chip provides more linear or more progressive settings: The progressive setting produces an overall leverage rate of 31.8%, while the linear setting reduces that to 26.9%. The Firebird’s linkage was designed to work well with either air or coil shocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, Swinger dropout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-swinger-dropout-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivot also gave the Firebird their patented Swinger dropout system, providing Short or Long chainstay length settings. There’s an 8mm difference between the two, and the dropouts are compatible with UDH hangers in either setting. The non-drive side uses a flip-chip to adjust the chainstay length, while the drive side uses the Swinger dropout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up front the Firebird gets an oversized 56mm I.D. straight head tube, allowing riders to add reach or angle adjust headsets if desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, Toolshed storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-Toolshed-storage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 Firebird also offers Pivot’s Toolshed in-frame storage compartment. The Toolshed was designed to ensure your cargo doesn’t rattle around in your frame, and it has an easy to use, secure door latch system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The storage door has a few features of its own: A magnet on the inside of the door holds spare chain quick links, and a strap loop allows you to lash a multi tool or accessory to the backside of the door. Two Toolshed cargo bags are included with each bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, dual cable ports\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-dual-cable-port-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2025 the Firebird’s internal cable routing gets new dual cable ports. These ports run two cables/hoses through the same opening, which provides a clean look and a large opening for feeding cables through. All cables and hoses are secured with clips inside the storage area to keep them from rattling inside the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, water bottle and tool\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-w-bottle-tool-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the water bottle mount on the Toolshed door, the frame also features accessory mounts under the top tube and down tube. These mounts are ideal for add-ons like Topeak’s Dock Series multi-tools, which Pivot helped develop. All frame sizes can fit a water bottle on the Toolshed door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for key fitments, the Firebird uses a Super Boost Plus 157mm rear axle and a PressFit BB92 bottom bracket with ISCG05 mounts. The frame provides ample clearance for 29×2.5” or 27.5×2.6” rear tires, and it fits 31.6mm seat posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To protect the frame from rocks, debris, and shuttle damage, the Firebird comes with two rubber down tube protectors that cover the whole length of the tube. Pivot also protects the frame from chain slap with chainstay and seat stay guards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivot is offering the Firebird in five frame sizes from XS-XL, covering riders from 4’11” to 6’5” or taller. Aside from the slacker steering and steeper seat mast, the new Firebird’s BB sits 5mm lower than the previous frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A geometry flip-chip in the Firebird’s rocker link provides High or Low geo settings. With four possible geometries between 29”/MX wheel options and High/Low settings, I’ll skip trying to summarize things here – see the charts below for all the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>29″ Geometry:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-29-geometry.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-29-geometry.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, 29&quot; geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-29-geometry.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-29-geometry-297x202.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-29-geometry-120x82.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-29-geometry-768x522.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MX Geometry:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-MX-geometry.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"817\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-MX-geometry.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, MX wheel geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-MX-geometry.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-MX-geometry-297x202.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-MX-geometry-120x82.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-MX-geometry-768x523.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, three bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-three-bikes-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Firebird is available in a wide model range. Pivot is offering two Ride, four Pro, and four Team builds. See the spec charts below for all the details and prices, but let’s run down a few highlights from the different builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Team and Pro builds include Fox’s new 2026 Factory Float X2 rear shocks. However, if you opt for the Neo builds (available on Team and Pro models), you can upgrade to Fox’s Live Valve Neo Coil shock and Neo wireless dropper post.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Firebird Pro models offer wheel upgrade options. The stock DT Swiss wheels can be upgraded to Reynolds Blacklabel Enduro Pro wheels with Industry Nine hubs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-handlebars.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"862\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-handlebars.webp\" alt=\"2025 Pivot Firebird, handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-handlebars.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-handlebars-297x213.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-handlebars-120x86.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pivot-2025-Firebird-handlebars-768x552.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Team and Pro models also get Pivot’s new Phoenix Team Carbon handlebar. This bar has been tuned for a balance of strength, stiffness and vibration absorption. All Team and Pro builds also get Pivot’s updated Phoenix Team Enduro V2 stem, which now offers a larger clamp area and a cleaner look. Three different size-specific lengths are stocked on the bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ride SLX/XT:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
