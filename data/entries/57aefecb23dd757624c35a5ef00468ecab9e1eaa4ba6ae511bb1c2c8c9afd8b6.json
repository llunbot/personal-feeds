Captured photos are sent to an app and can be viewed on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. A built-in AI feature called Nature Intelligence interprets the \"sights and sounds of nature,\" to show birds hatching, butterflies flitting by, bees visiting flowers, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/wonder-blocks-ces-2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe camera has a flexible stem and universal clip so it can be positioned anywhere outdoors, and it can be purchased with an optional solar roof.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWonder Blocks are designed to be used alongside Petal, and can be used to create habitats for wildlife. With a pedestal base, users can personalize Wonder Blocks with plants, seed trays, bee hotels, bug hotels, and a butterfly feeder.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Petal camera and Wonder Blocks will be available as part of a Kickstarter campaign in spring 2025.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">CES 2025</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/ces-2025-wonder-insect-camera/\">Bird Buddy Launches 'Wonder' Camera for Watching Insects</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bird-buddy-launches-wonder-camera-for-watching-insects.2446839/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57aefecb23dd757624c35a5ef00468ecab9e1eaa4ba6ae511bb1c2c8c9afd8b6","category":"Apple"}
