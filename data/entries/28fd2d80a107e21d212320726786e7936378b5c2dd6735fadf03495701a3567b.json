Despite that rumor’s persistence, it never materialized, and all we got at the time was a slightly larger Series 6. History tends to repeat itself, and Apple watchers will recall a similar rumor ahead of this year’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Series 10</a> launch. Reputable leakers had suggested that 2024’s Apple Watch would feature the most significant overhaul yet, only for the Series 10 to follow in the Series 7’s footsteps. So, what gives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What we expected</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the iPhone X, the Apple Watch Series X—as it was rumored to be called—was expected to mark a major milestone for Apple’s decade-old wearable. It was rumored to bring radical changes, including a new flatter design with a much thinner case along with a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2030272/apple-watch-x-anniversary-thinnner-case-magnetic-bands-blood-pressure.html\">magnetic band attachment mechanism</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img

changes, initial rumors pointed to the addition of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2123009/apple-watch-series-10-health-features-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea.html\">blood pressure monitor</a>, which would alert users when it detects hypertension. This would’ve further enriched the Apple Watch’s health-related capabilities and potentially helped affected users become aware of the underlying medical conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that Tim Cook unveiled the first Apple Watch as a One More Thing exactly a decade before the Glowtime event, it made sense for Apple to celebrate the occasion through the sleeker form factor and new health sensor. Expectations were high leading into the event for the most significant Apple Watch overhaul ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What we got instead</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that didn’t happen. All we got was an incremental Apple Watch Series 10 upgrade with very few meaningful new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone maker claims that the Series 10 features an all-new design, our eyes see otherwise. The overall case still looks identical to its recent predecessors. Apple may boast about a 10-percent thinner build but it boils down to just a single millimeter compared to the Series 9 (10.7mm to 9.7mm) that many users won’t notice. I acknowledge that slimming down an advanced smartwatch by even 1mm is no easy task, but calling it an all-new design is a little disingenuous—especially when rumors were claiming there would actually be an all-new design. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png\" alt=\"Apple Watch series 10 in jet black\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 is nice, but it’s hardly an all-new design.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch series 10 in jet black\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 is nice, but it’s hardly an all-new design.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch series 10 in jet black\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 is nice, but it’s hardly an all-new design.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, the aluminum models are now around two grams lighter, which won’t really impact your life in any way. In Apple’s defense, however, the new titanium variants are significantly lighter than their (now-retired) stainless steel counterparts, despite sharing the same outer look. (And let’s not forget that previous Apple Watch Editions were available in titanium.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the health department, blood pressure monitoring is a no-show, reportedly due to some engineering difficulties. Meanwhile, Apple hasn’t managed to find an alternative to its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2202755/kill-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-tool.html\">blood-oxygen sensor</a>, which it no longer offers in the U.S. due to a patent dispute. The sensor is presumably included on the Series 10 but disabled, but even so, there’s no indication that Apple will switch it on anytime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the Apple Watch Series 10 will be able to detect sleep apnea, the feature won’t be exclusive, as the Series 9 and Ultra 2 will offer it, too. In short, Apple’s 2024 smartwatch takes a step backward when it comes to health monitoring.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra 2 review - night mode\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>With the exception of the Ultra, the Apple Watch hasn’t really changed much since its 2015 launch.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra 2 review - night mode\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>With the exception of the Ultra, the Apple Watch hasn’t really changed much since its 2015 launch.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Jim Martin / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra 2 review - night mode\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-review-night-mode.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>With the exception of the Ultra, the Apple Watch hasn’t really changed much since its 2015 launch.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Jim Martin / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Jim Martin / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the Series 10 unleashes a new built-in speaker, allowing Apple Watch users to blast music or podcasts without using AirPods—which is fine but please don’t when you’re in public. It also borrows other Apple Watch Ultra 2 perks, such as the depth gauge (with some limitations) and water temperature sensor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it a notable upgrade for someone coming from a Series 6? Yes, without a doubt. But does it take the same big leap forward as the iPhone X and adopt groundbreaking changes to mark the decade? Far from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there any hope?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it frustrating that we’ve now gone through two rounds of major Apple Watch redesign rumors that didn’t come to fruition. While Apple has notably improved the smartwatch’s aesthetics throughout the years, it ultimately still looks the same. We’ve obviously gone through a few size increases and bezel reductions. However, its build has largely remained unchanged, and the way we interact with it hasn’t evolved much. And no, the double-tap gesture is not it.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-screen.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHYQ1VJ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$369 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch\" target=\"_blank\">399 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6572677&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6572677%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831\" target=\"_blank\">$399 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I still have some hope. While the Apple Watch was announced in September 2014, it didn’t go on sale until April 2015. So, it’s possible Apple mark the 10th anniversary with a new model in 2025. This could be through a special edition with those rumored magnetic band attachments and a further slimming of the Apple Watch’s size that forgoes some of the higher-end health features. After all, the iPhone 17 Air is rumored to make its debut with a focus on its ultra-thin body rather than high-end features, and Apple could go for a similar approach with its smartwatch, allowing customers to choose between a stylish design or high-end features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it’s too early to guess what products we’ll see next year. Plans change, prototypes get axed, and AirPowers get forever locked in underground basements. What I know for sure, though, is that I won’t be falling for Apple Watch design change leaks going forward.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"28fd2d80a107e21d212320726786e7936378b5c2dd6735fadf03495701a3567b","category":"Apple"}
