That’s a question scientists have debated over the last 30 years, ever since <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95jd03410\">they noticed a sharp drop in CO<sub>2</sub></a> around the year 1610 in air preserved in Antarctic ice.</p>\n<p>That drop in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels is the only significant decline in recent millennia, and scientists <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:CLIM.0000004577.17928.fa\">suggested</a> that it was caused by reforestation in the Americas, which resulted from their depopulation via pandemics unleashed by early European contact. It is so distinct that it was <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14258\">proposed as a candidate</a> for the marker of the beginning of a new geological epoch—the “Anthropocene.”</p>\n<p>But the record from that ice core, taken at Law Dome in East Antarctica, shows that CO<sub>2</sub> starts declining a bit late to match European contact, and it plummets over just 90 years, which is too drastic for feasible rates of vegetation regrowth. A different ice core, drilled in the West Antarctic, showed a more gradual decline starting earlier, but lacked the fine detail of the Law Dome ice.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028113#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028113&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Howard Lee","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ceabfe6d617f2cda1bff0890964b362ff697eb294b60a8e4b32e036301f9b25","category":"Tech"}
