Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts a half hour later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nKeep reading for some key things to know about the quarter, including a recap of new products announced, revenue expectations, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Products During Quarter</h2>\r<br />\nThe quarter ran from December 31, 2023 through March 30, 2024, according to Apple's fiscal calendar. The following products launched during this period:<ul><li>Apple Vision Pro</li>\r<br />\n<li>13-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip</li></ul><h2>Revenue Expectations</h2>\r<br />\nApple has not provided formal revenue guidance since before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the average Wall Street estimate for Apple's second quarter revenue is $90 billion, according to <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2264410/should-you-buy-apple-aapl-stock-ahead-of-q2-earnings\">Zacks Investment Research</a>. This would be around a 5% decline compared to the $94.8 billion revenue the company reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/04/apple-2q-2023-earnings/\">in the year-ago quarter</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMaestri provided the following commentary on Apple's earnings call last quarter:<blockquote>As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago.</blockquote><h2>Conference Call</h2>\r<br />\nCook and Maestri will hold a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Thursday to discuss the company's quarterly earnings results. The call should last around one hour, and it will include a Q&amp;A segment with analysts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA live audio stream of the conference call will be available on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\">Apple's Investor Relations page</a>, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\r<br />\nApple's current quarter runs through June 29.
