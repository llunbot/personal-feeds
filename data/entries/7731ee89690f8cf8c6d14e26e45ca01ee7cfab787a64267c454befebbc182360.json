He specifically worried about \"the change in the role of the App Store to now an organization that needs to collect money from developers.\"</blockquote>Despite his reservations, an Apple pricing committee that included CEO Tim Cook, former CFO Luca Maestri, and Apple's legal team ultimately decided to implement the commission structure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe reduced 27% fee (down from Apple's standard 30%) was established after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-vs-apple-decision/\">2021 Epic Games lawsuit ruling</a>. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected claims that Apple operated a monopoly. However, she ruled that Apple's anti-steering conduct was anti-competitive, and ordered the company to allow developers to link to alternative payment methods outside the App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple complied by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/\">creating a system</a> where developers can apply for a \"StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement\" to direct users to external payment options. However, Apple still demands a 27% commission on these transactions made within seven days of clicking the link. For developers in Apple's Small Business Program, the rate is 12% instead of the usual 15%.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney previously criticized Apple's approach as <a href=\"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408147260571730\">\"bad-faith\" compliance</a> with the court order, arguing the minimal commission reduction and other restrictions undermined the ruling's intent to foster more competition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current hearings are scheduled to continue until Wednesday, and are focused on determining whether Apple has violated the original court order. Judge Gonzalez Rogers has expressed frustration with Apple witnesses' hazy recollections about how they developed rules for the alternative payment system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to court documents, Apple extensively analyzed how the \"less seamless experience\" of external purchases would affect transaction completion rates, which helped the company work out when developers would likely return to using Apple's in-app purchase system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe dispute between Apple and Epic <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/\">dates back to 2020</a> with Epic seeking to overturn Apple's App Store rules requiring content purchases within iOS apps to go through Apple, which takes a 15% to 30% cut of the revenue.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apples-phil-schiller-concerns-app-store-fee/\">Apple's Phil Schiller Initially Opposed 27% App Store Fee on External Purchases</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-phil-schiller-initially-opposed-27-app-store-fee-on-external-purchases.2450149/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7731ee89690f8cf8c6d14e26e45ca01ee7cfab787a64267c454befebbc182360","category":"Apple"}
