The Shazam app engages the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s microphone to hear the song, and it is able to listen while the other app is in use. After a few seconds, the song will be identified and swapping back to Shazam will show the song name and information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is simpler to use the built-in Song Recognition feature in the ‌iPhone‌'s Control Center to identify a song. With Song Recognition, you can open up an app like YouTube, play a song, swipe into Control Center, and tap the Song Recognition icon to determine what's playing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing this method does not require you to exit out of the YouTube app. Once a song is identified, it shows up as a notification or in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, and you can tap into the Shazam app to get more information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIdentifying a song with Shazam adds it to a Shazam playlist in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> so you can listen to it in full at a later time. For those who don't have ‌Apple Music‌, the Shazam app also keeps track of recent Shazams.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShazam can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free.
