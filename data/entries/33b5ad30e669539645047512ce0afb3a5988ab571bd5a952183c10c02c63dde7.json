This includes the Preload hydration, sports drink mixes, Rapid Recovery, and Fuel in both caffeinated and non-caffeinated versions. MSRP $24.00.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/osmo-single-serve-rapid-recovery-preload-hydration.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/osmo-single-serve-rapid-recovery-preload-hydration.jpg\" alt=\"new single-serve osmo rapid recovery protein drink mix and preload hydration packets.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/osmo-single-serve-rapid-recovery-preload-hydration.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/osmo-single-serve-rapid-recovery-preload-hydration-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/osmo-single-serve-rapid-recovery-preload-hydration-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/osmo-single-serve-rapid-recovery-preload-hydration-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/osmo-single-serve-rapid-recovery-preload-hydration-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That bundle is possible because they just added single-serve packets for their <a href=\"https://osmonutrition.com/collections/recovery-2/products/rapid-recovery-single-serve-packet\">Rapid Recovery drink mix</a> and <a href=\"https://osmonutrition.com/collections/hydration/products/osmo-preload-hydration-single-serve\">Preload pre-ride hydration drink mix</a>. Yes, it’s more packaging, but they’re great for travel or stuffing in a jersey pocket when a big ride finishes somewhere other than at home and you need to get your protein in. You are getting enough protein, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Carbs Fuel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-1.jpg\" alt=\"carbs fuel high-carbohydrate energy gel and sports drink mix.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbs Fuel is a newer brand that started with their high-carb, flavor-free gel. They’re $2 each for 50g of carbs plus a bit of sodium, which is considerably more calories per serving than most other gels. We’ve been trying them and they work great. They’re mildly sweet, a good just-thick-enough consistency, and deliver more carb-per-dollar…what’s not to like?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-2.jpg\" alt=\"back label of carbs fuel sports drink mix.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/carbs-fuel-drink-mix-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their sports drink mix is brand new, using a mix of simple and complex carbs to deliver 75 grams of carbs, 300 calories, and 500mg of sodium per serving. There’s no added flavor, just clean, simple fuel. MSRP is $36 for a 1,000g package, serving count depends on usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spring Energy</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-1.jpg\" alt=\"spring energy gel with real food ingredients.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://myspringenergy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Energy</a> is a different kind of energy gel, using real food (like organic basmati rice) as the main ingredients and carbohydrate source.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1349\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-2.jpg\" alt=\"back label of spring energy gel with real food ingredients.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-2-1536x1151.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/spring-fuel-energy-gel-with-rice-and-fruit-juice-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their Awesome Sauce flavor uses real apple sauce and juice, plus yams and maple syrup, both for flavor and calories. Lemon juice subs in for citric acid as a preservative, making this one of the cleanest real food products I’ve seen. They taste pretty good, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UnTapped</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untapped-maple-syrup-drink-mix-packets.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untapped-maple-syrup-drink-mix-packets.jpg\" alt=\"untapped single-serve maple syrup sports drink packets.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untapped-maple-syrup-drink-mix-packets.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untapped-maple-syrup-drink-mix-packets-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untapped-maple-syrup-drink-mix-packets-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untapped-maple-syrup-drink-mix-packets-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untapped-maple-syrup-drink-mix-packets-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t tried <a href=\"https://untapped.cc/product-category/mapleaid-hydration/\">UnTapped’s MapleAid</a> sports drink but you like maple syrup, it’s worth a shot. And that’s exactly what these single serve packets offer, a liquid concentrate that you add to a water bottle (16-20oz, ideally), for a hydration mix that’s sweetened with maple syrup. Curious but not ready to pull the trigger? Make some lemonade and sweeten it with maple syrup. If you like that, you’ll like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tactical ORS</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tactical-ORS-single-serve-hydration-packets.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tactical-ORS-single-serve-hydration-packets.jpg\" alt=\"tactical hydration single serve ORS drink mix packets.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tactical-ORS-single-serve-hydration-packets.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tactical-ORS-single-serve-hydration-packets-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tactical-ORS-single-serve-hydration-packets-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tactical-ORS-single-serve-hydration-packets-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tactical-ORS-single-serve-hydration-packets-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the makers of <a href=\"https://store.livefluid.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fluid</a> sports drinks, their <a href=\"https://store.livefluid.com/products/tactical-ors-oral-rehydration-solution\" target=\"_blank\">Tactical product line</a> is a lower-calorie, hydration focused mix aimed at fitness folks, first responders, and others who aren’t riding or running for hours, but need to stay hydrated.

Each one has 700 calories with a mix of fat, protein, and carbohydrate sources plus vitamins and minerals. I haven’t tried them, but the ingredients suggest they’ll keep you feeling fuller for longer than carb/sugar-only products. MSRP is about $9.50 per pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kodiak</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-1.jpg\" alt=\"kodiak cakes crunchy protein granola bars.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kodiakcakes.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kodiak</a> usually hands out their pancakes at events, which are great, but this year they had a new Crunchy Granola Bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-2.jpg\" alt=\"kodiak crunchy granola bar ingredients panel.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-2-297x103.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-2-1536x532.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-2-120x42.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kodiak-crunchy-protein-granola-bars-2-768x266.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like their other products, these are higher in protein, mainly from wheat and pea proteins. They’re a bit drier and less sweet than, say, Nature’s Valley, but pack 10g of muscle-building protein and are slightly more filling.

I also really like that they make lighter roasts because a true “light roast” instant coffee is hard to find. They work great for cold brew, too. Boxes are $15 (5 packs), bags are $60 (50 one-cup servings).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tecnu</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tecnu-poison-ivy-oak-skin-wipes.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tecnu-poison-ivy-oak-skin-wipes.jpg\" alt=\"tecnu poison ivy wipes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tecnu-poison-ivy-oak-skin-wipes.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tecnu-poison-ivy-oak-skin-wipes-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tecnu-poison-ivy-oak-skin-wipes-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tecnu-poison-ivy-oak-skin-wipes-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tecnu-poison-ivy-oak-skin-wipes-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This one isn’t nutrition, but it’s definitely something that can keep you going (and it’s small enough that it’s not really worth a standalone post). <a href=\"https://tecnu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tecnu’s</a> new single-use Poison Ivy/Poison Oak wipes are a God-send for those of us who get destroyed by such plants (hand raised again). Keep a couple in your pack or car and use after riding in places like Santa Cruz where you can get a rash just by looking at the ground cover. Also great for trail work days where you’re traipsing through the woods getting into who knows what.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nutrition-roundup-osmo-carbs-fuel-spring-rec-pak-more/\">Nutrition Roundup: Osmo, Carbs Fuel, Spring, Rec Pak &amp; more!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"33b5ad30e669539645047512ce0afb3a5988ab571bd5a952183c10c02c63dde7","category":"Cycling"}
