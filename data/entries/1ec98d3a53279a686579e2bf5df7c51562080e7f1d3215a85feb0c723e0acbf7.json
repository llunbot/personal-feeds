All of Nvidia’s product tiers have seen their prices creep up over the last few years, but cards like the 4090 raised prices to new heights, while lower-end models like the 4060 and 4060 Ti kept pricing the same but didn’t improve performance much.</p>\n<p>Today, Nvidia is sprucing up its 4070 and 4080 tiers with a mid-generation “Super” refresh that at least partially addresses some of these pricing problems. Like older Super GPUs, the 4070 Super, 4070 Ti Super, and 4080 Super use the same architecture and support all the same features as their non-Super versions, but with bumped specs and tweaked prices that might make them more appealing to people who skipped the originals.</p>\n<p>The 4070 Super will launch first, on January 17, for $599. The $799 RTX 4070 Ti Super launches on January 24, and the $999 4080 Super follows on January 31.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994212#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994212&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1ec98d3a53279a686579e2bf5df7c51562080e7f1d3215a85feb0c723e0acbf7","category":"Tech"}
