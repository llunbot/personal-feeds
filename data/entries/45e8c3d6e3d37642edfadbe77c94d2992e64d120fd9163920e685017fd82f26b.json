They probably walked.</p>\n<p>The existence of any prehistoric apex predators in the islands of the Caribbean used to be doubted. While their absence would have probably made it even more of a paradise for prey animals, fossils unearthed in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic have revealed that these islands were crawling with monster crocodyliform species called sebecids, ancient relatives of crocodiles.</p>\n<p>While sebecids first emerged during the Cretaceous, this is the first evidence of them lurking outside South America during the Cenozoic epoch, which began 66 million years ago. An international team of researchers has found that these creatures would stalk and hunt in the Caribbean islands millions of years after similar predators went extinct on the South American mainland. Lower sea levels back then could have exposed enough land to walk across.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/carnivorous-crocodile-like-monsters-used-to-terrorize-the-caribbean/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/carnivorous-crocodile-like-monsters-used-to-terrorize-the-caribbean/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"45e8c3d6e3d37642edfadbe77c94d2992e64d120fd9163920e685017fd82f26b","category":"Tech"}
