Share Item Location\nis available now in most regions worldwide as part of the public\nbeta of iOS 18.2, which will soon be available to all users as a\nfree software update for iPhone Xs and later. Find My is built\nwith privacy and safety at its core. The shared location will be\ndisabled as soon as a user is reunited with their item, can be\nstopped by the owner at any time, and will automatically expire\nafter seven days. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Users can generate a Share Item Location link in the Find My app\non their iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Recipients of a link will be able\nto view a website that shows a location of the item on an\ninteractive map. The website will automatically update when a new\nlocation is available and will show a timestamp of the most\nrecent update.</p>\n\n<p>In the coming months, more than 15 airlines serving millions of\npeople globally — including Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air New\nZealand, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines,\nDelta Air Lines, Eurowings, Iberia, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,\nLufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Air\nLines, Turkish Airlines, United, Virgin Atlantic, and Vueling — will begin accepting Find My item locations as part of their\ncustomer service process for locating mishandled or delayed bags.\nMore airlines will be added over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a cool feature. Feels closer and closer to a no-brainer to keep an AirTag in each of your checked bags now.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/12/find-my-airtags-airlines\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc6cbead485c2e9aa9725a1f4cbf757d1bb1defe91f7c84d5c0966a2b368f2e6","category":"Tech"}
