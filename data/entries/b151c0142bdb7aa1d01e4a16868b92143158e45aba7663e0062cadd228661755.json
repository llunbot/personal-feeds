This article is intended to be part one of a two-part series, and in part two, we'll combine our bind DNS instance with an ACME-enabled LAN certificate authority and set up LetsEncrypt-style auto-renewing certificates for LAN services.</p>\n<p>If that sounds like a fun couple of weekend projects, you're in the right place! If you want to fast-forward to where we start installing stuff, skip down a couple of subheds to the tutorial-y bits. Now, excuse me while I babble about my personal life.</p>\n<h2>My name is Lee, and I have a problem</h2>\n<p>(Hi, Lee.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001156#p3\">Read 127 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001156&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b151c0142bdb7aa1d01e4a16868b92143158e45aba7663e0062cadd228661755","category":"Tech"}
