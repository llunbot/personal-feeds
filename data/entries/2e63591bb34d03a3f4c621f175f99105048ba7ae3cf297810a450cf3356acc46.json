Few fans could forget Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/tua-tagovailoa-sidelined-with-head-injury-replaced-by-teddy-bridgewater-as-dolphins-qb-182735830.html\">stumbling on the field</a> after a huge hit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/26/miami-dolphins-tua-tagovailoa-concussion-buffalo-bills-nfl-football\">being cleared to play</a> and then sustaining another <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/sports/football/tua-tagovailoa-head-injury.html\">scary injury</a> a few days later. The scene of a wobbly player being escorted off the field after a head impact is all too familiar on high school fields, in college stadiums, and, of course, in the NFL. Yet we hear claims that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/02/05/is-it-wrong-to-watch-football/football-is-safer-than-it-has-ever-been\">the game has gotten safer</a>, as the NFL regularly reports progress in the fight against concussions, citing new rules and equipment, greater awareness, improvements in its concussion protocol, and continued research into the issue.</p>\n<p>Can we be confident that all of these efforts are making a difference? As weâ€™ll see, the answer may well be no.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982723#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982723&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e63591bb34d03a3f4c621f175f99105048ba7ae3cf297810a450cf3356acc46","category":"Tech"}
