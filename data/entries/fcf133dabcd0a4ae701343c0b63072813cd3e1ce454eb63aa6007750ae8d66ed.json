CDK later told its clients on June 25 that the attack was a \"cyber ransom event,\" and that restoring services would take \"several days and not weeks.\" Allan Liska, with analyst Recorded Future, told Bloomberg that BlackSuit was responsible for at least 95 other recorded ransomware breaches around the world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035541#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035541&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fcf133dabcd0a4ae701343c0b63072813cd3e1ce454eb63aa6007750ae8d66ed","category":"Tech"}
