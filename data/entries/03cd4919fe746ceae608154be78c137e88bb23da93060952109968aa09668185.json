They allow us to test the communications and networking technology that will be used in our final satellite design, and help us validate launch operations and mission management procedures that will be used when deploying our full constellation.\"</p>\n<p>Amazon said it will launch the satellites from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on ABL Space Systems' <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/abl-space-has-never-launched-a-rocket-but-it-just-landed-a-huge-contract/\">RS1 rocket</a>, as part of a multilaunch deal the companies announced today.
