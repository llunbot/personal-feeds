Published in Scientific Reports this Tuesday, the fossil doesn’t capture one dinosaur attacking another—rather, the predator in this case is a smaller mammal known as <i>Repenomamus robustus, </i>and it died with its teeth clamped upon the herbivorous <i>Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis</i>, a dinosaur three times its size.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03102\">Gut contents</a> from a <i>Repenomamus </i>fossil described in 2005 prove this same mammalian species ate very young and considerably smaller <i>Psittacosaurus</i>. But the remarkable fossil revealed today is the first evidence of any Cretaceous mammal attacking a larger dinosaur. It’s an astounding snapshot of ancient behavior, challenging previous assumptions of predator/prey dynamics millions of years ago.</p>\n<h2>A final struggle</h2>\n<p>These two species in the fossil couldn’t be more different. <i>Psittacosaurus</i> is a type of bipedal ceratopsian dinosaur—an early relative of dinosaurs such as Triceratops—with a large beak-like snout and spiky tail bristles. This was a herd animal, and it's the most commonly found fossil in the Lujiatun Member of the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of China. This particular <i>Psittacosaurus</i> was approximately 6.5–10 years old when it died.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954694#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954694&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeanne Timmons","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bd6105662c2bcacc27c6d1f45626cb9d9bdd1104faa211796500068d4a99a2ef","category":"Tech"}
