Low weight is critical for fast climbing, but a modern road race bike also needs to be aerodynamic so you can ride fast on the flat and descents. That makes them among the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">best road bikes</a> you can buy if you are looking for a fast ride and are comfortable with the performance on offer and the often uncompromised approach to geometry, position and ride comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While previously, many brands sold separate <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aero bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-lightweight-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">lightweight bikes</a>, it’s increasingly common for the best race bikes to cover both bases, although there are still exceptions. The Pinarello Dogma always fulfilled both roles, but brands including Giant and Scott retain separate aero and lightweight alternatives. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/aero-lightweight-all-rounder-fastest-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">The science proves</a> however that for mountain stages the best solution is an all round bike rather than a pure lightweight bike or an aero bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end many brands that did have two bikes have merged them, as aero bikes have become increasingly less beefy and lighter and lightweight bikes more aero – Specialized was an early merger, while Trek is a recent convert. There are also increasing examples of brands having both an aero bike and an all-round road race bike, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/colnago-y1rs\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago</a> and Van Rysel, so teams can use the all-out aero bike for the flat stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are our picks of the best all-round road race bikes that we’ve reviewed, while further down the page we have buying advice for would-be buyers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best all-round road race bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pinarello Dogma F – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pinarello-dogma-f-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trek Madone Gen 8 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-madone-gen-8-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cannondale SuperSix Evo – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enve Melee – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/enve-melee-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giant TCR – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-tcr-advanced-pro-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Van Rysel RCR – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/van-rysel-rcr-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Factor Ostro VAM full review coming soon.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust <em>Cyclist</em>‘s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Man riding Enve Melee bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-15-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at <em>Cyclist</em>, we review the cream of the crop of the best road and gravel bikes available, so you can be pretty sure that if a bike is a contender in the best race bikes stakes, we’ve ridden and rated it.

But although the shape looks almost the same, Pinarello has reduced the frame’s weight and made the front of the frame narrower, with a new steerer that slims down the head tube. It has also beefed up the down tube still further and redesigned the Most Talon Ultra Fast bar/stem with lower weight and angled levers as well as narrower widths available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now grazing the UCI weight limit, the Dogma F climbs as well as you’d expect. Watch this space for our full review of the new model coming very soon. The ride is no-compromise stiff, but with tyre clearance now 32mm, the opportunity is there to increase its comfort levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a

quality might be improved by wider tyres</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the looks are superficially similar, the Tarmac SL8 is lighter and a claimed ‘five watts more aero’ than the SL7. Specialized has slimmed down the rear of the bike, where aero benefits are less, so it’s more comfortable too. At the front, the longer head tube, with its slightly bulbous Speed Sniffer nose, along with the one-piece Roval bar/stem make compensating aero gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In top S-Works spec, the Tarmac SL8 hits 6.6kg, which makes it a solid climber too. The ride is direct, but once again we’d counsel non-racers to increase tyre width from the 26mm S-Works Turbos fitted, taking advantage of the 32mm clearance. We’d also like to see the option to change bar/stem dimensions when purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trek Madone Gen 8</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-970x649.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Madone Gen 8\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-970x649.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-768x514.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-2048x1371.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-750x502.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-1140x763.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Madone-Gen-8-0-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£12,000 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25809&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sigmasports.com%2Fitem%2FTrek%2FMadone-SL-7-Gen-8-Road-Bike%2F130SP%3Fs%3D1\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lower weight but just as aero as the seventh generation Madone</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More compliant at the saddle, but stiff at the bars and bottom bracket, for handling and power delivery</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining the aerodynamics of its predecessor with the low weight of the Émonda, the Generation 8 Trek Madone is also more compliant, at least at the saddle.

That means a big pricetag, that can be hard to swallow. Almost every road race bike is available with lower specs too. Often, the frame grade is lower than the top spec bikes, but don’t let that put you off. A lower spec frame may only be a couple of hundred grams heavier than the premium frame, with the bits bolted to it accounting for the bulk of any additional weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy a lower spec bike and the frame may be ripe for upgrades, which may cost less than the price difference between it and the top spec bike but deliver similar performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Price of ownership</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just the purchase price that can be daunting for a premium road race bike. Consumables and parts replacement will in general be high as well. The price of a top spec cassette and accompanying chain will run into the hundreds of pounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you intend to use your bike for racing, there’s always the risk of crashes. Your rear derailleur is in a prime position to be taken out and again a top spec model will cost hundreds of pounds to replace. Unless you’re an elite racer, a lower spec may be a better, less expensive choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comfort and performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s the tendency to want to emulate the pros and buy a bike that matches theirs. If you’re a racer, we get it. But for general road riders who don’t race, a road race bike may not be the best option. Most will have an aggressive ride position, which puts pressure on your back, neck, shoulders and hands. Not everyone can get comfortable and longer rides can become painful. You’ll ride your bike more and further if it feels less of an ordeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as lightweight bikes are increasingly aero, so bikes labelled endurance are no longer sedate.
