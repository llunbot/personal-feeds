Apple</em> antitrust dispute</a>. That leaves most of Epic's complaints about Apple's practices unanswered, but the gaming company achieved one victory on pricing notices.</p>\n<p>It all started in August 2020, when Epic sought to work around Apple and Google's app stores and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/epic-vs-apple-google/page/2/\">implemented virtual currency purchases</a> directly inside <em>Fortnite</em>. The matter quickly escalated to the courts, with firms like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/epic-spotify-and-others-take-on-apple-with-coalition-for-app-fairness/\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/microsoft-backs-epic-against-apple-in-legal-fight-over-unreal-engine-on-ios/\">Microsoft</a> backing Epic's claim that Apple's App Store being the only way to load apps onto an iPhone violated antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The matter <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-vs-apple-trial-starts-today-heres-what-to-expect/\">reached trial in May 2021</a>.

Epic scored a seemingly huge victory in September 2021 when a Northern California judge demanded that Apple <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/\">allow developers to offer their own payment buttons</a> and communicate with app customers about alternate payment options. An appeals court upheld that Apple's App Store itself <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/apples-ios-walled-garden-doesnt-break-antitrust-laws-appeals-court-affirms/\">wasn't a \"walled garden\"</a> that violated antitrust laws but kept the ruling that Apple had to open up its payments and messaging.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996264#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996264&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0220978ae7d0036c75a5ef02e2729037492e7e311d6bc4f1f37eb89bc3f91874","category":"Tech"}
