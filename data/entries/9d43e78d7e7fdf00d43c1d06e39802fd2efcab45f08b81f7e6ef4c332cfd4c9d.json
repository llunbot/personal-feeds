When a user has installed a screen recording app, Sequoia will display a new monthly reminder that the app “is requesting to bypass the system private window picker and directly access your screen and audio.” The reminder tells the user that granting permission may allow “personal or sensitive information” that may be visible or audible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As spotted by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/macos-sequoia-screen-recording-app-permissions/\">MacRumors</a>, the prompt in the recently released macOS Sequoia beta 2 gives the option to allow the screen recording app to have permission for one month. After that, the prompt appears again and the user needs to grant access. In the Sequoia beta 1, this reminder was set to appear weekly. The beta 1 also showed a prompt after system restarts, but this has been removed in beta 2. Apple has not provided a way to grant permanent permission to a screen recording app so the reminders stop appearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon initial installation and launch of a screen recording app, a prompt instructs the user on how to grant permission to the app to allow screen and audio recording. The setting is in System Settings &gt; <em>Privacy &amp; Security</em> &gt; <em>Screen &amp; System Audio Recording</em>. Apple put in this layer of security to prevent apps from recording without the user knowing. However, for users who feel they have a good handle on what is going on with their Mac, the monthly prompt is a little annoying, but at least it’s not the weekly reminder anymore.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Sequoia screen recording persission\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=300%2C132&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=768%2C338&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=1200%2C528&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=1536%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=2048%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"528\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>Permissions for screen recording apps in macOS System Settings.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sequoia screen recording persission\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=300%2C132&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=768%2C338&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=1200%2C528&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=1536%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=2048%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"528\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Permissions for screen recording apps in macOS System Settings.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sequoia screen recording persission\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=300%2C132&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=768%2C338&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=1200%2C528&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=1536%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sequoia-screen-recording-permissions.jpg?resize=2048%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"528\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Permissions for screen recording apps in macOS System Settings.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">Users who are interested in macOS Sequoia can try the public beta</a>, but keep in mind that since it’s beta, it may have issues with your software and may not run as smoothly as you’d like.
