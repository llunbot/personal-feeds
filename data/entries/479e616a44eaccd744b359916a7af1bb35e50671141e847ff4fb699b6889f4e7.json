You can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ/\">M2 iPad Air for $549 at Amazon</a>, a $50 discount from its MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365408/11-inch-ipad-air-m2-review.html\">review of the iPad Air</a>, we gave the tablet a 4-star rating and noted how great the processor upgrade is while also appreciating the tablet now comes with 128GB minimum storage capacity. Another feature we love about the iPad Air is the screen, even though it hasn’t really changed from the previous model with the M1 chip. The Liquid Retina display has a solid 500 nits brightness, which means you’ll have a great experience even when using it indoors or outside in bright sunshine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The lower entry-level price, the increased basic memory capacity of 128GB, and the front camera on the long edge are all pleasing upgrades for this generation of Air. The fact that the iPad has also been given the next chip up, the M2, is also welcome,” our review noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that a $50 discount isn’t necessarily fantastic for most tech, but Apple is pretty stingy about deals on its newst devices, so it’s a nice surprise to see another price drop, especially since it’s only been available for a few months. It’s also quite likely that this is the best price we’ll see this year, with no additional price drops, even for Black Friday. So go ahead and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ/\">get the 11-inch iPad Air M2 for $549 at Amazon</a> before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Snatch the new iPad Air for its best price yet</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"479e616a44eaccd744b359916a7af1bb35e50671141e847ff4fb699b6889f4e7","category":"Apple"}
