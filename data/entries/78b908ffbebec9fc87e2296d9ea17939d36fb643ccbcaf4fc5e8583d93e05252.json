{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win Custom-Colored AirPods or AirPods Pro From ColorWare","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/14/macrumors-giveaway-colorware-airpods-pro-april/","date":1681488282000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we're teaming up with <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/\">ColorWare</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a set of custom-painted third-generation AirPods or second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>. All of ColorWare's products come in hundreds of unique color combinations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/colorware-shiny-gold.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nFor those unfamiliar with ColorWare, it is a customization company that has been offering <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/categories.aspx?category=258\">custom painted Apple products</a> and accessories for many years now. ColorWare offers up unique painting options for the AirPods, ‌AirPods Pro‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, AirTag, and Magic Mouse, plus it also provides custom painting for Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony devices, including consoles and controllers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/colorware-red.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nCustom-colored <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/categories.aspx?category=257\">third-generation AirPods</a> can be purchased from ColorWare for $329, which includes custom painting for both the AirPods and the accompanying <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> case. <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-1345-airpods-pro-2nd-gen.aspx\">Custom AirPods Pro 2</a> can be purchased from ColorWare for $389. There's definitely a premium for ordering from ColorWare, but since Apple only makes AirPods and ‌AirPods Pro‌ in white, going through ColorWare is the only way to get AirPods in black, red, blue, pink, or dozens of other colors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/colorware-black.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nColorWare offers both solid and metallic paint options, with gloss and matte finishes depending on your preference. You can get the traditional gray, gold, or silver colors to match Apple's devices, but there are also colors in every shade of the rainbow. If you want AirPods or ‌AirPods Pro‌ in yellow, orange, teal, green, deep purple, blue, pink, or one of dozens of other colors, ColorWare is your best bet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/colorware-yellow.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" />\r<br />\nEach AirPod can be custom painted in the same color as the case or you can order the case and the earbuds all in different colors, so there are many color combinations to choose from.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/colorware-black-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nColorWare also has some <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/categories.aspx?category=263\">fun special edition options</a> like the \"CowPods\" with a black and white cow-patterned case accompanied by ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 painted either pink or black. There's also <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-1336-colorware-airpods-3rd-gen-supernova.aspx?c=&amp;cartRecordId=0&amp;year=\">a \"Supernova\" color option</a> that features a glittery, prismatic effect in an array of rainbow colors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/colorware-supernova.jpg\" alt width=\"1776\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nIn business since 1998, ColorWare has perfected its painting process. The company uses a multi-step coating sequence that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and an X2 liquid plastic coating that protects the color. The custom painting is guaranteed for 12 months or 24 months with the purchase of an additional warranty.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/colorware-airpods-purple-pink.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nColorWare uses standard third-generation AirPods and second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ from Apple and paints them, which leaves the full AirPods functionality intact.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/colorware-airpods-blue.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nWe have two sets of custom-painted AirPods to give away, with each winner able to choose AirPods model and the the color and finish of their choice.
