(credit: Lyft)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The ride-hailing company Lyft is changing up its maps, which until now have been powered by Google. Lyft will now use <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/bosch-buys-stake-in-aggregated-vehicle-mapping-company-here/\">Here</a> instead. Lyft says the switch will mean a better search database for places and addresses as well as more accurate predicted arrival timesâ€”two important things for a ride-hailing company to get right.</p>\n<p>\"Over the past six months, we have worked in collaboration with Lyft to implement and test our robust destination catalog that helps riders get to more destinations in cities across North America. Our services are now enriching the Lyft network, spearheading innovation in the rideshare industry,\" said Here CEO Edzard Overbeek.</p>\n<p>There may be other motivations for the switch. According to Lyft's head of rideshare, Ashwin Raj, the switch will \"improve the efficiency of our marketplace,\" but the press release also explicitly mentions keeping user data private.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781881#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781881&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
