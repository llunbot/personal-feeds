These slim arm profile cranks have a high offset, which allows you to run a shorter bottom bracket than with most square taper cranks. This is a huge plus with 73mm shells and wide chainstays, allowing you to keep the cranks closer to the frame.  The cranks come with a set of bolts and self-extractor caps, are available in four colors, including silver and a wild anodized splatter, and are in 170 mm lengths only at the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Made in Taiwan</li>\n<li>Forged Aluminum</li>\n<li>Color- Polished, Black, Brown, or Splash</li>\n<li>Outer Chainring BCD- 110×5</li>\n<li>Inner Chainring BCD- 74×5</li>\n<li>Bottom Bracket Compatibility- JIS Square Taper (Length will vary depending on the bike, but 110-113mm is a good place to start.)</li>\n<li>Lengths- 170mm</li>\n<li>Tooth Count- 42/26t</li>\n<li>Weight- 702g (Complete Crankset with Bolts and Extractors Installed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://crustbikes.com/products/crust-heart-crankset?ov_contact=ct_o0bg961neulcb73\" target=\"_blank\">Crust Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crust-bikes-heartbreaker-cranks-are-in-stock/\">Crust Bikes Heartbreaker Cranks are in Stock</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"eed464bddaa6ebb60317ae3b8765e13c22b6729d8d8e6a2cdd50850daae19390","category":"Cycling"}
