Read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>M4 Pro Chip Benchmark Results Reveal an Extremely Impressive Performance Feat</h2>\r<br />\nAhead of the official launch of the M4 Macs, we began seeing some impressive benchmarks for the new chips. While we had some idea of the raw performance of the base M4 chip given its inclusion in the iPad Pro released earlier this year, the M4 Pro and M4 Max are brand-new higher-end chips with correspondingly better performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-M4-Pro-vs-M4-Max-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/m4-pro-chip-benchmark-results/\">M4 Pro tops even the M2 Ultra</a> in multi-core CPU performance, with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-max-chip-geekbench-benchmark-results/\">M4 Max pushing things even further</a> with two additional CPU cores compared to the M4 Pro in their highest configurations. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-pro-m4-max-graphics-benchmarks/\">On the graphics side</a>, the new M4 Max can't quite match the M2 Ultra with its 76-core GPU at the high end, but it comes pretty close and blows past the M3 Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor a comparison of all of the M4 variants found in the latest Macs, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-vs-m4-pro-vs-m4-max/\">be sure to check out our guide</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mac Mini With M4 and M4 Pro Reviews: Smaller Design and Pro Performance Make for Major Upgrade</h2>\r<br />\nWith the new M4 Macs being announced around a week and a half of ahead of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/new-macs-now-available-for-apple-store-pickup/\">their public launch</a>, media and YouTubers were able to get some early hands-on time with the new machines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/m4-mini-hands-thumb-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nReviewers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/mac-mini-with-m4-and-m4-pro/\">appreciated the Mac mini's redesign</a> and beefed-up power, while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/m4-macbook-pro-reviews-processor-benchmarks-impress-new-nano-texture-option-worth-the-extra/\">MacBook Pro delivers solid spec improvements</a> and a fantastic new nano-texture display glass option. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/m4-imac/\">M4 iMac offers a similar nano-texture glass option</a>, a Center Stage camera, and updated colors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe've had a brief chance to go <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-hands-on/\">hands-on with the Mac mini</a> ourselves, and it's definitely an impressive upgrade in nearly every way.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Silicon Unified Memory: How Much Mac RAM Do You Need?</h2>\r<br />\nWith all Macs now starting with at least 16GB of unified memory, it's worth considering how much you should opt for when choosing or configuring a new Mac for purchase. After all, memory can't be upgraded after purchase, so you need to get it right the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nOne of our latest guides <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/how-much-mac-ram/\">walks through the various memory options</a> ranging from 16GB on consumer machines all the way up to a maximum of 192GB on the Mac Pro, so see where you fall based on the tasks you need your Mac to be able to accomplish.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Everything New in iOS 18.2 Beta 2</h2>\r<br />\nApple is continuing work on iOS 18.2 and related updates that are expected to officially launch in early December, and the latest beta seeded to developers and public beta testers this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/everything-new-ios-18-2-beta-2/\">includes a number of changes</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Generic-iOS-18.2-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nA new Find My feature lets you <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/ios-18-2-beta-2-siri-chatgpt-limit/\">temporarily share the location of an item like an AirTag</a> with an \"airline or trusted person\" which can be useful when trying to track down lost luggage or other items. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/ios-18-2-beta-2-siri-chatgpt-limit/\">Siri integration with ChatGPT has been enhanced</a> with information on daily limits for free users, as well as offering the ability to upgrade to a paid ChatGPT Plus plan.
