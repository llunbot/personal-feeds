If you have just received a new iPhone you probably want to dive right into the phone the moment you get the box in your hands, but try to contain your excitement and do a little prep first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start playing with your new iPhone, we have a little setup advice you’re going to want to heed. Sure, it seems like an unnecessary drag, but this stuff is going to really save you a lot of time and frustration later. And while you wait for backups and updates to take place, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">guide to iOS 17</a> to get up to speed with the latest iPhone operating system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are actually two ways to set up your new iPhone. You can use a backup of your old iPhone or you can use Apple’s Quick Start feature to sync the two iPhones. We’ll run through both options. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to set up a new iPhone</h2>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3><strong>Back up your old iPhone</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Backup-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=792\" alt=\"Backup iPhone\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Whichever way you want to transfer the data from your old iPhone to a new one, we recommend making a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">backup your old iPhone</a> before you begin. We recommend you make this backup <em>after</em> you have your new iPhone in hand, so the backup is as up-to-date as it can possibly be. You can back up via iCloud, in iTunes (on a Windows PC or older Mac), or in the Finder (on macOS Catalina or later).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a backup of your old iPhone it is easy to set up your new iPhone so that everything is exactly as you are used to it being. The backup includes all the settings on your device, such as your wallpaper, Home screen layout, your app data, and the way you have your apps organized on your device. Your backup also contains contacts, Calendar and Mail data, as well as a backup of your Messages and Photos. All this will be limited by the storage space available. There are some other services Apple offers that you might also like to sign up for to ensure that everything is in sync (such as iCloud Photos and Messages in Cloud). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For an iCloud backup: </strong>No need to connect your old iPhone to your Mac. Just launch Settings and tap on your Apple ID profile listing at the top, then go to <em>iCloud &gt; iCloud Backup</em> and select <em>Back up now</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For a Mac backup (macOS Catalina or later): </strong>Connect your old iPhone to your Mac, open a new Finder window, and select your iPhone in the left column in the Locations section. In the Backups section, choose, <em>Back up all of the data on your iPhone to this Mac</em>. Checking <em>Encrypt local backup</em> is a good idea, so your account passwords and health data get backed up too—just choose a password you won’t forget. Click the button to <em>Back up now</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For a Mac backup (macOS Mojave or older) or a PC backup: </strong>The backup process is similar to the Finder method above, but instead, you use the iTunes app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you happen to be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234137/how-to-switch-from-android-to-iphone-tips.html\">moving to iPhone from an Android phone</a> (hey, welcome to the garden!), there’s an Android <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios&amp;xcust=1-1-434754-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Move to iOS app</a> that can assist you with getting all of your Google account data in Mail, Calendars, and Contacts, moving your camera roll over, even transferring your Chrome bookmarks to Safari.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Back up and reset Apple Watch </h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Apple-watchOS-9-sleep-stages.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Watch and iPhone sleep stages\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If you are an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch</a> owner beware: Switching iPhones will require you to reset your watch or it will remain synced with your old iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Apple Watch’s apps and settings will be backed up to the Watch app on your iPhone before it’s reset – don’t worry about storage, as the backups are only around 100-200kB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have health data you must back up your iPhone via iCloud or using an <em>encrypted</em> iTunes/Finder backup, as for legal reasons, Apple isn’t allowed to store personal health-related data in unprotected backups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that if you choose not to encrypt your backup in iTunes/Finder on your Mac (this happens automatically in iCloud), your backup will restore your Apple Watch apps, but it won’t transfer your exercise/health data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, take a look at this:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671861/how-to-keep-your-apple-watch-apps-when-switching-to-a-new-iphone.html\">How to keep Apple Watch apps when switching to a new iPhone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can unpair your Watch from your old iPhone, either in the Watch app on your old iPhone (tap your watch, then the “i” icon, then <em>Unpair Apple Watch</em>, then enter your iCloud password when prompted), or on the watch itself (<em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Reset</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, when you launch the Watch app on your new iPhone, it will walk you through the pairing process including setting a passcode, unlocking behavior, and Apple Pay.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Use Quick Start to transfer data to the new iPhone</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-transfer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iOS transfer\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Using the built-in iPhone transfer feature is the easiest way to move to a new iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>We’ve run through how to back up your iPhone, but there is an option that doesn’t require you to make a backup (which might appeal if you don’t pay for iCloud storage or don’t have a lot of space on your Mac or PC). You can use the Quick Start feature on the new iPhone to sync all the data from your old one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Quick Start feature is the absolute easiest way to move to a new iPhone. It’s practically <em>magic</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having worked through the initial steps of selecting your country or region and adjusting the text and icon sizes to suit, you will arrive at the Quick Start page. Your new iPhone will immediately start looking for nearby devices. Eventually, you will see a pop-up on your old iPhone that says Set Up New iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll then need to point your old phone’s camera at your new phone (which displays a cloud of little dots) and enter your old phone’s 6-digit passcode. There’s a helpful option here to set up the old iPhone for a child to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll go through the rest of the setup process, like <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672731/how-to-use-face-id-on-iphone-what-to-do-when-it-doesnt-work.html\">enabling Face ID</a> and setting up Apple Pay, and then your phone will be ready to go, set up just like your old iPhone. It’ll even prompt you to update your old iPhone’s backup if it hasn’t been backed up in a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up your phone this way transfers over most of your settings, the arrangement of your home screen, and more. It’s a <em>huge</em> time saver. If you’re coming from a really old iPhone, you’ll have to update iOS first, as it requires iOS 11 or newer. You might as well update your old iPhone before you get your new one—you won’t want to wait for a long update process once you have your new iPhone in hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you finish setting up your phone this way, you’ll want to give it a little while to re-download all your apps. Initially, your phone will show placeholders for your apps, all arranged and stuffed into folders exactly as on your old iPhone. But your new phone has to actually re-download apps, because every time you download an app from the App Store, your phone actually grabs a unique version specifically optimized for that iPhone model. But your user data and settings get transferred over, and that’s the important part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is <em>by far</em> the fastest, easiest, and most complete way to transfer everything from an old iPhone to a new one. The feature has come a long way in the last few years. But we still recommend doing a full manual backup as described above, just in case something goes wrong.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>4.</span>\n<h3>Or set up your new iPhone using a backup</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Transfer-apps-and-data.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Transfer data from old to new iPhone\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If you don’t have the old iPhone handy, or the Quick Start option isn’t working (in the past we’ve had trouble syncing to an iPhone with a smaller capacity this way), or you just don’t want your iPhones to be out of action for a while, you can use the backup of your old iPhone to set up your new iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Quick Start page tap Set Up Without Existing Device to go straight to the Transfer Your Apps and Data page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few options here including: From iCloud Backup, From Another iPhone, From Mac or PC, and From Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose the option that matches your backup. To sync with your iCloud backup you’ll need to log in to your Apple ID, to use your Mac or PC backup you’ll need to connect the iPhone to your computer. To move from Android you’ll need to download the Move to iOS app on your Android phone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using an iCloud backup you’ll need to log in to your Apple ID and confirm via a code sent to a separate device as part of Apple’s two-factor authentication. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>5.</span>\n<h3>Set up Face ID and Apple Pay</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-pay-cash.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple pay cash\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>During the setup, you will be invited to scan your face so it can be used for Face ID. You can skip this step and do it later, but our recommendation would be not to wait too long. Face ID offers maximum security and is the quickest way to unlock your new iPhone, and will make it less painful to use a complicated passcode since you don’t have to type it in every time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The setup screen will prompt you and ask you to slowly move your head around in a circle a couple of times. It’s a lot quicker than tapping the home button a few dozen times to register a fingerprint was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worried about your privacy with Face ID? Don’t be. No photos of your face nor any other biometric data ever leave your phone—Apple doesn’t get <em>any</em> of that. And it isn’t accessible by other apps, just as other apps weren’t able to access your fingerprints with Touch ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you need to have Face ID enabled in order to use Apple Pay, this is also a good time to set that up. Again, you can set up Apple Pay during the initial setup of your iPhone or you can skip that step and jump into Apple’s Wallet app later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re new to Apple Pay, just follow the instructions to add a credit card or two. It’s likely that this will require you to confirm via text or a phone call that it is you doing so, especially if you haven’t set it up in the past. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already had Apple Pay on your old iPhone, you might notice that your credit cards have disappeared on your new iPhone. As a security measure, some methods of setting up and transferring iPhone data don’t carry over payment methods. The Quick Start wireless transfer should move everything over, though. Regardless, your Wallet history will still be there, but you’ll have to re-enter any payment cards you’d like to use with Apple Pay. (For more on Apple Pay, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/224366/apple-pay-faq-guide-cards-locations-devices-how-to-set-up.html\">Apple Pay guide</a>.) </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>6.</span>\n<h3>Charge it up, quick!</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2021/12/14/11/iphone-se-2020-100913837-orig.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" alt=\"iPhone se charging wireless\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Your new iPhone will have come with a bit of charge in its battery, but during this process, it is worth plugging it in so that it doesn’t run out of battery at some inopportune moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to identify what kind of charger your iPhone requires. Some iPhones will have a Lightning port, the newest iPhones will have a USB-C port. There will be a cable in the box, but you will need a power block to plug that into and you’ll need to check whether you need a power adapter with a USB-A or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-iphone-fast-charging.html\">USB-C</a> port. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675381/which-power-adapter-do-i-need-to-charge-my-iphone-12-or-13.html\">Which power adapter do I need to charge my iPhone?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option is to use wireless charging. To use this feature, you’ll need a compatible wireless charging pad that utilizes the Qi standard (we’ve tested the best wireless chargers). If you have one of those lying around, all you have to do is set your iPhone onto the pad and watch it start to power up. Say goodbye to the jumble of Lightning cables on your bedside table! See our round-up of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230820/the-best-wireless-chargers-for-your-iphone.html\">the best wireless chargers for iPhone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With iPhone 12, Apple introduced a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234834/best-magsafe-cases-chargers-accessories-iphone-12-12-pro-12-pro-max-12-mini.html\">feature called MagSafe</a> and it’s on subsequent iPhones too. It’s a magnetically attached charging puck (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">available separately for $29</a>) that is similar to other Qi wireless chargers, only with secure magnetic alignment. The precise alignment and new internal circuitry allow Apple to ramp up the charging speed all the way to 15 watts—twice as fast as it can go with regular Qi chargers and nearly as fast as a Lightning cable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fastest way to charge your iPhone is to use the cable though. Both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15-series support fast charging using the USB-C Power Delivery (USB-PD) standard. Anything over 15 watts will charge your iPhone quite rapidly. Your iPhone won’t have come with a power adapter, but you can plug the included USB-C to Lightning cable into any certified USB-C power adapter to charge up. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>7.</span>\n<h3>Update your apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3796023/app_store_iphone.png\" alt=\"App Store on the iPhone\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>You could start using your iPhone, but you may notice that some of your apps are still downloading. You should get the latest version of those apps that run on your new iPhone, but you may want to check the App Store to make sure you get the latest versions of all of your apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check for app updates, launch the App Store app, then tap your account icon in the upper right. You’ll find an updates section beneath all your account info, and you can get the updates here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have your apps auto-update by enabling the auto-updates toggle in Settings<em> &gt; App Store &gt; App Updates.</em> Or, you can manually update your apps and just check out the “What’s New” release notes to see what changed. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>8.</span>\n<h3>Learn the gestures and commands</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2021/09/24/11/iphone-13-safari-gestures-100904430-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" alt=\"iPhone Safari gestures\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If you’re upgrading from an iPhone with a Home button (such as the iPhone SE or iPhone 8) you’ll notice your new iPhone has no Home button. Where the Home button used to be, you now have an extra half-inch or so of glorious OLED display! iPhones haven’t had home buttons nor Touch ID for several years now, but if you’re coming from an iPhone with a home button you have some new gestures to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few basic commands you’ll need to re-learn:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Return Home:</strong> Just swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Easy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jump between apps:</strong> Swipe left or right along the bottom edge of the phone to jump back and forth between apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App switcher:</strong> Swipe up from the bottom edge, but not very far. Just go an inch or so from the bottom and stop. App cards will quickly pop up, and you can lift your finger off and swipe around through them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Close an app:</strong> If you need to kill an app from the app switcher, simply swipe up on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take a screenshot:</strong> Simply press the side button and the volume up button at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of other new commands and gestures to learn.

It’s a good site to bookmark. You may instead want to download the free iBook version in the Books app—when you need help, you may not be in a place where you have easy internet access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’ve been using iPhones for years, you’re sure to find some new trick or feature in Apple’s official guide.
