The new feature allows shoppers to search for electronics, home goods, grocery items, and last-minute gifts directly within the Maps interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/google-maps-product-search.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe update also brings navigation enhancements, with Google Maps now displaying real-time weather disruptions such as unplowed roads, flooded areas, and zones with low visibility. Public transit users can now also access crowdsourced delay reports and improved station information, including detailed subway entrance locations and alternative route suggestions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nElsewhere, for electric vehicle owners, Maps has gained a synced route planning feature with charging stops, allowing users to send their planned routes directly to vehicles with built-in Google Maps. Meanwhile, a new trailer-friendly routing feature, currently available for select 2024 Chevrolet and GMC models, helps drivers avoid low bridges and tunnels by considering vehicle dimensions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an effort to reduce holiday stress, Maps has also enhanced its Popular Times feature with detailed traffic predictions and store crowd information. Google recommends avoiding peak travel times, particularly between 1.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. in the days leading up to Christmas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Google_Maps_trends_popular_times.jpeg\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1625\" />\r<br />\nThe features are rolling out globally, although some functions like trailer-friendly routing are currently limited to specific vehicle models, with broader availability planned for the future.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/\">Google Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/google-maps-new-features-for-holidays/\">Google Maps Can Now Help You Find Last-Minute Holiday Gifts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-can-now-help-you-find-last-minute-holiday-gifts.2442960/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8e88c3757f55c19795dc249fb7e66630a905271a4ef3ef5f06b8f5ef84d7ae9f","category":"Apple"}
