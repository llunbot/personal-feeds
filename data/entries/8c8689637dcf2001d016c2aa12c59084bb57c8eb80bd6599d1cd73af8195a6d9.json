This number may be considerably smaller than the true total, since the FBI found that about 4,700 out of 500,000 emails in two of Chi's Gmail accounts—<code>backupagenticloud</code> and <code>applebackupicloud</code> at Gmail—contained iCloud credentials that Chi tricked his victims into providing.</p>\n<p>According to Chi, he selected roughly 200 of these victims based on online requests. Chi marketed his iCloud break-in \"services\" under the <em>nom de guerre </em><code>icloudripper4you</code>. His \"customers\" would identify an iCloud account for attack, after which Chi would use his sketchily named Gmail accounts to contact the victim, impersonating an Apple service representative.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789674#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789674&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c8689637dcf2001d016c2aa12c59084bb57c8eb80bd6599d1cd73af8195a6d9","category":"Tech"}
