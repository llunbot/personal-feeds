This sits at the foot of the next first category climb — the Alto de la Cobertoria, which averages 8.6% over 7.9km.</span></p>\n<p><span>The next 25km are flat. This phase of the race could be crucial in deciding whether the breakaway or the peloton win the stage. T</span><span>he second category </span><span>Altu la Segá o del Cordal begins with 30km remaining. Bonus seconds are handed to the first three riders at the top of the climb, which could encourage attacks from GC contenders if the breakaway has been caught. A steep, 6km descent sends the riders directly to the foot of the final climb.</span></p>\n<p><span>The inaugural ascent of the Alto del Gamoniteiro will undoubtedly have substantial consequences. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/E18-Gamoniteiro-VE21_4997d0dd-b3b7-4b0d-94f1-6cfc70bd4181_600x600.jpg?v=1630490299\" /></span></p>\n<p><em><span>Alto del Gamoniteiro profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The climb averages a leg-sapping 9.8% over 14.6km. The first 1.5km average closer to 7.4%, and the climb plateaus briefly after 9km to around 3%. Other than that, the Gamoniteiro averages between 10% and 14% throughout. Some sections are steeper still, with the final metres prior to the finish line reaching a discombobulating 17%. </span></p>\n<p><span>The <span>Alto del Gamoniteiro is the </span></span><em><span>Cima Alberto Fernández, </span></em><span>the highest point of the Vuelta </span><span>a España. The riders will finish at 1,770 metres above sea level after climbing almost 5,000 metres throughout the stage.</span></p>\n<p><span>For the GC protagonists, this is the best chance remaining to move up the standings. Those having a bad day will suffer terminal damage to their GC chances.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1335708671-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1630488101\" /><span>Primož Roglič</span> and Enric Mas (Image credit: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>To this point, </span><strong>Primož Roglič </strong><span>has been faultless across the opening 17 stages. He has never lost major time in the mountains, and with a 34km time trial approaching, he can be confident of gaining a considerable chunk of time on his rivals. He already has two stage wins in the bag, but will he hunt a third? </span><span>If <span>Roglič </span>is content with a pair of stages, Jumbo-Visma may set a pedestrian tempo in the peloton, which would give the breakaway a great chance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Movistar are best positioned to challenge <span>Roglič</span>.</span><b> Enric Mas </b><span>and </span><b>Miguel Ángel López</b><span> have trailed <span>Roglič </span>closely since the race began in Burgos. This is the final chance in the high mountains for Movistar to use their numbers to disrupt <span>Roglič</span>. If they are aiming for red, they must shake things up before the final time trial, and this is their best chance. </span>Attacking before the Alto del Gamoniteiro would be highly risky, but a high-risk strategy has a chance of reward.</p>\n<p><b>Egan Bernal </b><span>and </span><b>Adam Yates</b><span> remain in contention, but if the Ineos Grenadiers are to challenge for red or even jump onto the podium, they must be aggressive here. </span><b>Jack Haig</b><span> is also in contention for a spot on the final podium.</span></p>\n<p><span>The breakaway has a chance at winning the stage, particularly if a group of ten or more riders go clear early. </span><b>Romain Bardet, Damiano Caruso </b><span>and </span><b>Rafal Majka</b><span> are duking it out for the KOM jersey. With 45 points available over the four categorised peaks, including 20 at the finish on the Alto del Gamoniteiro, all of the aforementioned trio are likely to be on the offensive.</span></p>\n<p><b>Michael Storer, Chris Hamilton, Wout Poels </b><span>and </span><b>Mark Padun</b><span> are some of the riders who may support their KOM-chasing teammates in the breakaway, where they’d also have a chance at stage victory.</span></p>\n<p><span>Trek-Segafredo’s Vuelta a Espana shifted when Giulio Ciccone crashed and subsequently abandoned on stage 16. The Italian was six minutes down in the GC before he failed to finish. Without the Italian, the likes of</span><b> Juan Pedro López </b><span>and </span><b>Gianluca Brambilla</b><span> will be free to attack the race. Expect to see Trek-Segafredo represented up the road.</span></p>\n<p><span>Keep an eye on</span><b> Pavel Sivakov, Geoffrey Bouchard, Clément Champoussin, Mikel Landa, Ion Izagirre</b><span> and</span><b> Fabio Aru </b><span>too.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Cover image:</span><span> Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images</span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"be80a766a2b716742be008a6c171b63c4769f258e542b9cb3d390f1bc81629ac","category":"Cycling"}
