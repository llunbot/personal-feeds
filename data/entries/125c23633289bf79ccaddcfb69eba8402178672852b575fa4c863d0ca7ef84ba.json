In total, the riders will tackle 3,328km over 21 stages, with six mountain stages including five mountain-top finishes. </span>Here’s everything you need to know about the 2022 Tour de France route.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF22_VISUEL-PARCOURS_40x60_30SEPT_BD-A.S.O._1024x1024.jpg?v=1634221321\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>The first three stages take place in Denmark, with the first stage being a 13km time trial in the nation's capital, Copenhagen. The Tour de France hasn't opened with an individual time trial since 2017,</span><span> where Geraint Thomas won in D<span>ü</span>sseldorf.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Tour begins on Friday 1st July, with an additional rest day placed on 4th July after stage 3 to allow for the transfer between Denmark and France.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF_Cobbles_1024x1024.png?v=1634221283\" /></span></p>\n<p><em><span>Cobblestones return to the Tour de France on stage 5</span></em></p>\n<p><span>After stage 4 between Dunkerque and Calais, cobblestones return to the Tour de France on stage 5. Eleven cobbled sectors are crammed into the final 75km of the stage, with sectors ranging from 1.3 to 2.8km in length and totalling 19.4km. The GC contenders must stay wary here, and the Paris-Roubaix specialists will smell a rare opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><span>Peter Sagan will enjoy riding stage 6 with his new team TotalEnergies — the uphill finish in <span>Longwy </span>mirrors the stage he won in 2017. The final few kilometres feature gradients that touch 11%, suiting the punchy sprinters. The stage is the longest of the 2022 edition.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF22_ET07_PP_Super_Planche_des_Belles_filles-Hommes-A.S.O._1024x1024.jpg?v=1634221458\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>The first substantial test for the general classification riders takes place on stage 7 with La Super Planche des Belles Filles. The final metres of the 7km climb take place on a gravelled ramp, which touches an absurd 24%. The climb was seen at the 2019</span><span> Tour de France, where Dylan Teuns defeated Giulio Ciccone from the breakaway. The Italian’s consolation prize was the yellow jersey. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/inaugural-tour-de-france-femmes-route-revealed\"><b><i>The inaugural Tour de France Femmes will conclude on La Planche des Belles Filles.</i></b></a></p>\n<p><span>The Tour drifts into Switzerland and more specifically Lausanne on stage 8 for another finish that suits the puncheurs. The race enters the Alps on stage 9. The Col des Mosses (13.3km, 4.1%), Col de la Croix <span>(8.1km, 7.6%) </span>and Pas de Morgins <span>(15.4km, 6.1%) </span>will shake up the general classification ahead of the rest day.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Stage 10 is punctuated by a long, gruelling ascent to the Megève altiport — the final 21 kilometres take place on uphill terrain. The crucial stages for GC contenders only continue with a monstrous stage 11, which features an infamous trio of climbs: the Col du Télégraphe, Col du Galibier and Col du Granon. The final ascent averages a leg-sapping 9.2% over 11.3km.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF22-Profil_Etape_11-A.S.O._1024x1024.jpg?v=1634221485\" /></span><em><span>Tour de France 2022 Stage 11 profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The iconic climbs don’t end there. The riders must ascend Alpe d’Huez on stage 12, in addition to the Col du Galibier and Col de la Croix de Fer earlier in the stage. The 166km effort replicates the 1986 stage 18 between Briançon and Alpe d’Huez, where La Vie Claire teammates Bernard Hinault and Greg LeMond famously crossed the line hand in hand, more than five minutes ahead of the next finisher. The stage also takes place on Bastille Day.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF22-Profil_Etape_12-A.S.O._1024x1024.jpg?v=1634221522\" /></span><em><span>Tour de France 2022 Stage 12 profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The green jersey battle is set to resume on stage 13 with a chance for the sprinters in Saint-Etienne. The Côte de la Croix Neuve concludes stage 14, where Laurent Jalabert won in 1995. The climb averages more than 10% over 3km, providing the purest puncheurs with suitable terrain to attack.</span></p>\n<p><span>After another chance for the sprinters in Carcassonne on stage 15, the mountains return for stage 16. The Port de Lers (11.4km, 7%) and Mur de </span><span>Péguère (9.3km, 7.9%) are crested some way before the finish in Foix, which perhaps indicates that the breakaway will have an opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><em><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF22-Profil_Etape_17-A.S.O-size_1024x1024.jpg?v=1634222034\" />Tour de France 2022 Stage 17 profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>After setting off from Saint-Gaudens, stage 17 is one of the most testing of the race. The Col d’Aspin is the first of four categorised climbs that are packed into the final 75km of the 130 kilometre-long stage. Aggressive racing is likely before arriving in Peyragudes.</span></p>\n<p><em><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF22-Profil_Etape_18-A.S.O-size_1024x1024.jpg?v=1634222020\" />Tour de France 2022 Stage 18 profile</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The GC contenders must keep something in reserve for the punishing stage 18, which sees the Hautacam return to the Tour de France for the first time since 2014. Vincenzo Nibali and Bjarne Riis are some of the riders who have conquered the mountain, which averages 7.8% over 13.6km. The Hautacam is preceded by the Col d'Aubisque (16.4km, 7.1%) and Col de Spandelles (10.3km, 8.3%).</span></p>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF22-Profil_Etape_20-A.S.O-size_1024x1024.jpg?v=1634221990\" />Tour de France 2022 Stage 20 profile</em></p>\n<p>The sprinters will be given a penultimate chance on stage 19 in Cahors, before the final GC test on stage 20. A 40km time-trial could swing the tide in the general classification. Two short climbs wait in the final 5km of the time trial, meaning riders must manage their effort supremely throughout the first section of the course. We’ll already know who will win the 109th edition of the Tour de France when they set out for the iconic finish on the Champs Élysées.</p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"125c23633289bf79ccaddcfb69eba8402178672852b575fa4c863d0ca7ef84ba","category":"Cycling"}
