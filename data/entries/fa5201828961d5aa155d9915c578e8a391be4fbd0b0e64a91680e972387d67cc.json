While many legacy accounts still have their badges, the speedy removal of the badge from one of the platform’s most influential organizations was seemingly personally directed by Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/02/twitter-newyorktimes-musk-verified-badge/\">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>\n<p>In response to a meme joking about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/personaltech/twitter-blue-check-musk.html\">the Times’ decision not to pay $1,000 a month</a> to keep the gold check mark that Twitter sells to verify businesses, Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642383150230773760\">tweeted</a> on Saturday, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” On Sunday, Musk deleted a tweet that said legacy verified accounts would be given “a few weeks grace” before the check marks vanish “unless they tell they won’t pay now, in which we will remove it.”</p>\n<p>Making an example out of revoking the Times’ verified status seemed personal to Musk. In several tweets, Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642395451209940993\">mocked the Times</a>—which the Post noted is Twitter’s 24th-most-followed account—calling its news articles “propaganda” that “isn’t even interesting” and describing its Twitter feed as “diarrhea” that’s “unreadable.” He also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642598123964088320\">tweeted</a> that the Times was being “hypocritical” because the news organization is “super aggressive about forcing everyone to pay their subscription” fees. (Two years ago, the Times increased its digital subscription price for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/04/media/newyorktimes-raises-subscription-price/index.html\">CNN reported</a>, raising it to $17 a month.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928662#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928662&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa5201828961d5aa155d9915c578e8a391be4fbd0b0e64a91680e972387d67cc","category":"Tech"}
