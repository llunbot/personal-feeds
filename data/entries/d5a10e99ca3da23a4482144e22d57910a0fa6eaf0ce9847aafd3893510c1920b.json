Edits is made for creators, and it can be used with Instagram or other social media apps like TikTok.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEdits is designed for video creation, and it has a full suite of tools for filming videos, editing, and adding effects like AI-powered animations and cutouts. There's a section for keeping track of ideas, managing projects, and exporting content, plus an inspiration feed of reels with performance insights.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstagram says that it worked with creators to streamline the app's design and functionality so that it would meet the video editing needs of those who make content for social media.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the future, Edits will get support for keyframes, AI modifications, collaboration tools, and more fonts, text animations, voice effects, and filters.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEdits is a free download from the ‌App Store‌.
