Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported on it but offered no details, and a couple of weeks ago, MacGeneration <a href=\"https://www.macg.co/aapl/2025/05/calendrier-chaines-dassemblage-ia-ces-startups-quapple-recemment-achetees-pour-ameliorer-ses-produits-301339\">confirmed</a> that Apple acquired Mayday Labs last year, makers of the <a href=\"https://mayday.am/\">Mayday</a> calendar app, which used AI to “help you organize, protect, and manage your day” before it was shuttered last May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further confirmation on a new Calendar was spotted by Macworld contributor<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/filipe-esposito\"> Filipe Espósito</a>, who noticed a job posting for a <a href=\"https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200590045/senior-software-engineer-calendar-experience\">Senior Software Engineer, Calendar Experience</a>. The posting, which was listed on April 29, states that Apple is looking for candidates to join a team that will “reimagine what a modern calendar can be across Apple’s platforms.” That’s pretty much a confirmation from Apple that Calendar is undergoing a dramatic revamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the speculation switches from whether Calendar will be revamped in the first place to what it will look like and how it will work. Will Mayday’s interface simply replace the Calendar app’s UI, or will Apple incorporate Mayday features and maintain the classic Calendar’s look? As for those features, Mayday Labs’ Jeremy Bell is keen on AI, <a href=\"https://mayday.am/blog/the-ai-assistant-opportunity\">stating</a> that “AI assistants will usher in a new era of personal productivity and fulfillment.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the features Mayday offered included a Calendar Shield that blocked your calendar when you are overbooked, and <a href=\"https://mayday.am/blog/ai-scheduled-tasks\">AI-Schedule Tasks</a>, where the software would “suggest the optimal time to focus on that task, automatically blocking out a slot in your calendar.” Another feature of the Mayday calendar was the ability to find schedule conflicts and provide insight on rescheduling (see video). Those all sound like Apple Intelligence features that could be unveiled at WWDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new AI-infused calendar app might not be the kind of AI that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2787725/sticking-to-its-guns-used-to-be-an-apple-strength.html\">gets all the headlines</a>, but it’s the type of features Apple excels at, as Bell puts it, ones that “automate the mundane.” With rumors that WWDC probably won’t feature the<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2787510/apple-plans-to-offer-ai-alternatives-as-it-works-to-overhaul-siri.html\"> major Siri AI overhaul</a> that’s long overdue, Apple will likely opt to showcase smaller features that make our devices easier to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">kick off WWDC with a keynote on June 9</a> to showcase the new features of iOS, macOS, and the rest of its operating systems. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"09b9e591e7107201bda6b3b0d2ffa3a19f77784e49eb11193bbee43b38ef6021","category":"Apple"}
