In the past, it has been caught making \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/feds-told-tesla-to-stop-making-misleading-statements-on-model-3-safety/\">misleading statements</a>\" about the safety of its electric vehicles, and more recently, an investigation by Reuters found Tesla EVs <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/tesla-exaggerated-ev-range-so-much-that-drivers-thought-cars-were-broken/\">exaggerated their efficiency</a>. Now, <a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/media/hinton-v-tesla-inc-et-al.pdf\">a lawsuit filed in California</a> alleges that the cars are also falsely exaggerating odometer readings to make warranties expire prematurely.</p>\n<p>The lead plaintiff in the case, Nyree Hinton, bought a used Model Y with less than 37,000 miles (59,546 km) on the odometer. Within six months, it had pushed past the 50,000-mile (80,467 km) mark, at which point the car's bumper-to-bumper warranty expired. (Like virtually all EVs, Tesla powertrains have a separate warranty that lasts much longer.)</p>\n<p>For this six-month period, Hinton says his Model Y odometer gained 13,228 miles (21,288 km). By comparison, averages of his three previous vehicles showed that with the same commute, he was only driving 6,086 miles (9,794 km) per 6 months.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/tesla-makes-its-cars-lie-about-their-mileage-lawsuit-claims/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/tesla-makes-its-cars-lie-about-their-mileage-lawsuit-claims/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
