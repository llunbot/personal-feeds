Till now, there's been some unknown about whether Apple will stick with its November or October timeframe for this year. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says the company is poised to announce M1X powered MacBook Pros within the next month, noting that \"Apple typically does its major new Mac introductions in October. So stay tuned.\" In the paywalled section of the newsletter, Gurman also reiterated what we can expect performance-wise from the new machines. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The Apple M1X chip, the likely name for a more graphics-intense and professional-focused M1 chip, is indeed still on tap for 2021. We'll likely see it show up first in a new range of MacBook Pros in the next month and a higher-end Mac mini at some point. The M1X has been developed in two variations: both with 10 CPU cores (eight high-performance and two high-efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores.</blockquote>Previous report suggests that alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple may also announce a redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>.
