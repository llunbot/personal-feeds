A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>The first half of 2024 passed by without a new Apple TV, so that rumor has expired.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/apple-sept-9-event-preview-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-airpods-and-watches\">Gurman said</a> \"stable inventory\" of the Apple TV suggested that a new model was not on the \"immediate horizon\" after all:<blockquote>While the company has been working on an update to the Apple TV set-top box for as early as this year, no new model has come to fruition and stable inventory of the device suggests a new version isnâ€™t on the immediate horizon.</blockquote>All in all, there is no longer a clear timeframe for the next Apple TV. If you are considering purchasing an Apple TV, we recommend at least waiting until October is finished, just in case a new model is announced this month like in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhenever it comes out, the next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/\">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/\">could have a sub-$100 starting price</a>. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for $129 and $149, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/\">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/\">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRead our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV roundup</a> for more details.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/apple-tv-rumor-recap/\">Waiting for a New Apple TV?
