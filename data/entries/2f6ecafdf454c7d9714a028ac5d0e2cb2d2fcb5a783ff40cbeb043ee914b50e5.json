{"title":"tvOS 17.2 changes your Siri Remote’s side button for the better","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2161876/tvos-17-2-siri-button-press-to-search.html","date":1701715277000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When your Apple TV upgrades to tvOS 17.2 this month, the function of the Siri button on your remote will change a little. Instead of always invoking Siri, it will now have two functions: just tap it to bring up a search box, speak what you want to search for, and you’ll get a page of results that shows results throughout the TV app and Apple Music. If you want to use Siri, press and hold the Siri button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s awkward at first, but this is a good thing. It just takes a day to get used to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change was first discovered in tvOS 17.2 beta 4, so if you’re running the beta it may already be in effect for you. If not, it’s probably going to end up on your Apple TV box when tvOS 17.2 goes out to everyone (probably in mid-December). As with all features in beta versions, there’s a chance it will be pulled before release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search feature is handy. Any app/service you use that supports the TV app has its content indexed, so you can find shows from Paramount+, Disney+, or Hulu just fine. (Really, Netflix is the only major holdout these days.) It also shows results from Apple Music, and there are taps to filter results if you only want one or the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re used to simply tapping the mic for Siri commands like “What did he say?” or “Go back five minutes” then you’ll have to adjust to holding the button down for a second. Likewise, if you are used to holding the button down when dictating text into a search or password field, you’ll have to get used to tapping the button, as holding it down now only performs Siri commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good change, overall. It’s clear and consistent: Holding the button always performs Siri actions, which mimics the side button on an iPhone. Tapping quickly is like “typing” and fills in dictation areas or, when you’re not in one, opens a search that works like Spotlight (CMD-Space on a Mac).</p>\n\nApple TV</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2f6ecafdf454c7d9714a028ac5d0e2cb2d2fcb5a783ff40cbeb043ee914b50e5","category":"Apple"}
