Elizabeth Warren (D.,\nMass.) said in a statement. “After Meta pays to play, what does\nMark Zuckerberg expect as a return on this investment?”</p>\n\n<p>Serious talks about the suit, which had seen little activity since\nfall 2023, began after Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, flew to\nTrump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to dine with him in November,\naccording to the people familiar with the discussions. The dinner\nwas one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the\nrelationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also\ndonated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump\nwarned that Zuckerberg could go to prison if he tried to rig the\nelection against him.</p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of the November dinner, Trump raised the matter of\nthe lawsuit, the people said. The president signaled that the\nlitigation had to be resolved before Zuckerberg could be “brought\ninto the tent,” one of the people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A good reminder that self respect has no price tag.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Weeks later, in early January, Zuckerberg returned to Mar-a-Lago\nfor a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerberg-meta-trump-pivot-392e4a3f?mod=article_inline\">full day of mediation</a>. Trump was present for part\nof the session, though he stepped out at <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-sentencing-hush-money-new-york-9f9282bc?mod=article_inline\">one point to be\nsentenced</a> — appearing virtually — for covering up hush\nmoney paid to a porn star, one of the people said. He also golfed,\nreappearing in golf clothes and talking about the round he had\njust played, the person said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even when you own the golf course and <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/culture/trump-drives-golf-cart-onto-green/\">drive your cart right onto the green</a> like a jackass, an 18-hole round of golf still takes like three hours. I just love the idea of him leaving Zuckerberg sitting around for half a fucking day while he played a round of golf after his felony sentencing, before getting back to negotiating the price of the bribe to get “into the tent”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/wsj-suck-trump-payoff\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0a39a10d5e311d082ac24687d86003b8d4e135fc4077cc1016d9ae1451b67b11","category":"Tech"}
