(It\nlooks like the iOS source code is actually just unmodified\nSignal, so maybe they actually only published their Android\ncode.)</p></li>\n<li><p>On Saturday night, an anonymous source told me they hacked\nTeleMessage.</p></li>\n<li><p>On Sunday, I, along with Joseph Cox, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/\">published an article</a>\nabout the hack to 404 Media (and to <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/\">my blog</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>On Monday, NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/telemessage-suspends-services-hackers-say-breached-app-rcna204925\">reported</a> that TeleMessage suspended\nits service after a <em>second hacker</em> breached TeleMessage and\n“downloaded a large cache of files.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Today, Senator Ron Wyden <a href=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/doj_letter_telemessage.pdf\">published</a> a letter, which cites\nthe 404 Media article and my analysis of TM SGNL, to Attorney\nGeneral Pam Bondi, requesting that the Justice Department\ninvestigate the “serious threat to U.S. national security posed\nby TeleMessage, a federal contractor that sold dangerously\ninsecure communications software to the White House and other\nfederal agencies.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>National security leaders using this app — which effectively just <em>removes</em> all of Signal’s actual security features by backing up all messages as plain text — is stupid it’s surprising, even from these idiots Trump has surrounded himself with. I mean think about how stupid it is that Mike Waltz was using this app while in front of press photographers at a Cabinet meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Lee goes deep, including an analysis of TM SGNL’s open source Android source code, to show that it’s designed to transmit backups of messages in plain text to publicly-facing servers. And it turns out those servers had easily-hackable flaws.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> Wired: “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tm-signal-telemessage-plaintext-message-archive/\">The Company Behind the Signal Clone Mike Waltz Used Has Direct Access to User Chats</a>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/08/trump-admin-tm-sgnl\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"34b93b39ca6ac171f2ca214b5d382a1cead3c8662a1932b21ad3c20034a1ac06","category":"Tech"}
