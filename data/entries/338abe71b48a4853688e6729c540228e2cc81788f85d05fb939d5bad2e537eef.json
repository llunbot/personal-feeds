In an oddity of those changes, Apple mistakenly listed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a> as Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, a role he stepped down from in August of last year to become an Apple Fellow. Apple moments later took down Schiller's biography and the entirety of the leadership page. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's newsroom is where the company issues press releases, updates, and more, while the leadership page lists all of Apple's executives. No other pages on Apple's website currently seem to be impacted, and it remains unclear whether this is simply an error or telling of something more coming soon. We'll update this post when there are any changes. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/07/apple-website-errors-reinstates-phill-schiller/\">Apple Website Experiencing Errors, Briefly Reinstates Phil Schiller As Senior VP of Marketing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-website-experiencing-errors-briefly-reinstates-phil-schiller-as-senior-vp-of-marketing.2315794/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=m0FbTU_lPMk:6PM7yu0SJsg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=m0FbTU_lPMk:6PM7yu0SJsg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/m0FbTU_lPMk\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"338abe71b48a4853688e6729c540228e2cc81788f85d05fb939d5bad2e537eef","category":"Apple"}
