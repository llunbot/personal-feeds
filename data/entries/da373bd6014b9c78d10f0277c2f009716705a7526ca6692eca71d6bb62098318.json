Kuo believes that the delay adds uncertainty around \"whether the new device will appear at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a>, as the market widely expects.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe delay also means that shipment forecasts of the headset for 2023 will be even lower than previously thought, reducing to just 200,000 to 300,000 units. Previously, around half a million units were expected to ship this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's cause for concern with the device is allegedly in anticipation of poor market feedback, catalysed by the economic downturn, hardware specification compromises, the weight of the device, the readiness of the headset's ecosystem and applications, and its high selling price. Kuo believes that the headset will be priced at $3,000 to $4,000, or even higher.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo's comments mirror a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-employees-concerned-about-headset/\">recent report</a> from <em>The New York Times</em>, which claimed that Apple employees have serious concerns about the headset's prospects, calling it \"a solution in search of a problem.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">yesterday announced</a> that ‌WWDC 2023‌ will be held between June 5 and June 9.
