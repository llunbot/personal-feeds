The original story is below: </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the technical data of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple iPhone 16e</a>, the parameters for fast charging—50 percent in 30 minutes with compatible hardware—and for wireless charging with Qi devices can be found in the “Power and Battery” section. However, if you compare the 16e’s Tech Specs with the technical data of an iPhone 16, you will notice that the information on MagSafe is completely missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2613730/iphone-16e-the-e-means-everything.html\" target=\"_blank\"> iPhone 16e is positioned as an entry-level iPhone with its price of $599</a>, this omission of an important function that Apple promotes everywhere else is somewhat puzzling. After all, Apple has included plenty of modern upgrades, including an OLED screen and an Action Button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why would Apple remove one of its much-praised technologies from its newest iPhone? Sources from the accessories industry have told Macworld that a possible explanation is that the built-in magnets of the MagSafe system apparently interfere with the reliability of Apple’s new C1 5G modem. So it’s possible that Apple had to drop MagSafe in order to ensure the best possible connection for its first-gen 5G modem, which is arguably more important than magnetic charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We reached out to Apple for comment and will update this article if we get a response.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16-tech-specs-MagSafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPhone 16 tech specs MagSafe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" /><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iPhone-16e-tech-specs-no-MagSafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPhone 16e tech specs no MagSafe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So perhaps that’s why the iPhone 16e can only charge wirelessly with the classic non-magnetic Qi standard. With Qi, you’ll get charging up to 7.5 watts, significantly slower than MagSafe, which tops out at 25W on the iPhone 16 and 15W on previous iPhones. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html\">Qi2</a>, which is based on Apple’s MagSafe, also offers 15W wireless charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible that cases could bring MagSafe charging as they did with the SE, but if the report is accurate, those cases might pose an issue with connectivity as well. In the meantime, if MagSafe is important, we recommend getting an iPhone 16.
