As an independent artist, Grimes says anyone can use her voice without penalty. \"I have no label and no legal bindings,\" she says.</p>\n\n<p>Her announcement comes after controversy over an unauthorized song featuring AI-generated vocals of Drake and The Weeknd that went viral earlier this month. Shortly after its reveal, the song got pulled from YouTube and other social media platforms under unclear circumstances, which The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688141/ai-drake-song-ghostwriter-copyright-umg-the-weeknd\">reports</a> could have been a botched fan tribute or a marketing stunt.</p>\n<div><blockquote><p>I'll split 50% royalties on any successful AI generated song that uses my voice.  Same deal as I would with any artist i collab with.  Feel free to use my voice without penalty.  I have no label and no legal bindings. <a href=\"https://t.co/KIY60B5uqt\">pic.twitter.com/KIY60B5uqt</a></p>— 𝔊𝔯𝔦𝔪𝔢𝔰 (@Grimezsz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650304051718791170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 24, 2023</a></blockquote></div>\n<p>Grimes is no stranger to the AI and tech cultural scene, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/29/671748124/on-we-appreciate-power-grimes-helps-us-greet-our-a-i-overlords\">written music</a> about AI and tweeted about the subject frequently.
