It’s not even past.’ So said American novelist William Faulkner, and it’s a sentiment cyclists can understand better than most. We may ride modern carbon fibre bikes on tarmacked roads but we remain at the mercy of a landscape formed eons ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with its rocky canyons, mist-draped forests and weather-carved outcrops, few places feel as primeval as Gran Canaria.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/switzerland-croix-de-coeur-cycling\">Switzerland’s gift to the Giro: Croix de Coeur Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colombia-cycling\">High country: Colombia Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 141: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>It’s something that my guide, Eva, warns me about before we begin our ride. Originally from Poland, she lived in Dublin long enough to pick up a Celtic lilt, and fell in love with Gran Canaria after stints in Mallorca. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I mention that it’s my first time here but that I have ridden in Mallorca before, she tells me not to expect the same. They may both be Spanish islands, but they weren’t created equally. Gran Canaria, she says, was formed from violent volcanic activity, and that is reflected in the riding.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The ride begins with an array of colours in Puerto de Mogán.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I’m told there are no easy days on the bike in this part of the world, just hard days and even harder ones. The weather is either glorious (generally in the south) or awful (typically in the centre and to the north of the island). Unless you hug the shoreline, you’re either going up or are on your way back down, Eva says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My visions of a gentle day out on a sunny Spanish island are fading fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The only way is up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our start point is the photogenic fishing village of Puerto de Mogán, located at about 8 o’clock if the island were a clock face. From there we will aim for dead centre of the dial, and the highest point of Gran Canaria, before turning southeast and heading back down towards the coast at Vecindario, at around four on the clock face. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Climbing already.

It would be possible to complete the loop by continuing for another 30km to return to Puerto de Mogán, but the coast road is under repair on the day of our ride and we don’t fancy taking our chances on the busy GC-1 main road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might call Puerto de Mogán a chocolate-box village, but with temperatures in the 20s even in mid-winter I wouldn’t expect to return home with a still-solid selection of salted caramels. After a roll around town to admire the hanging bougainvillaea, waterways and freshly painted wooden bridges – charming enough, although it’s a stretch to describe the place as ‘the Venice of the Canaries’, as the tourist board would have it – we make for the hills.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>El Molino Quemado, the 19th century mill of Mogán, has been beautifully restored to working order after being burned down in 1875.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This is going to be a ride of two halves. Apart from a few plateaux here and there, the morning will be all climbing, the afternoon the opposite. I’m already looking forward to seeing the route profile afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we head inland and make our way steadily up the Mogán valley, the crisp coastal blue skies soon give way to a flatter grey light. Sooner than expected we find ourselves among the lower-growing laurel trees. For all the greenery shown on a satellite image, Gran Canaria is a botanical shadow of its pre-colonial self.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>One of many pristine hairpins that snake their way through the Mogán valley as Cyclist heads into the highlands.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Until the Spanish arrived in the 15th century, two-thirds of the island’s 157,000 hectares (220,000 football pitches in real money) were under tree cover. In service to the sugar cane industry, the settlers embarked upon a relentless pillaging of the abundant natural resource until, by the mid-20th century, less than five per cent of those trees remained. Although an extensive reforestation effort has since more than tripled the tree cover, there remains a good deal to do to restore the island to something resembling its prehistoric state.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We have our own work to do this morning, although it couldn’t feel less like labour. It takes only half an hour of steady, civilised pedalling before we reach Pueblo Mogán and pass its newly restored 19th century windmill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rustic Molino de Viento feels a far cry from the mega on- and off-shore turbines that supply as much as 40% of Gran Canaria’s electricity on any given day. In form and function, however, they have more in common than not, evidence that the harnessing of renewable energy is (almost) as old as these hills.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The wild west of Gran Canaria shows evidence of the reforestation work that has taken place over the past 50 years.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Eva’s pre-ride pledge that we would barely notice the gradient for the first couple of hours of riding holds true. Even when I do become aware of the increased elevation, it comes via visual clues rather than any internal creaks or grumbles. This is less the land of lightweight climbing heroes than sprinters who can climb, supported by the fact that former British champion Ben Swift of Ineos Grenadiers holds the Strava record for our ascent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My head unit might indicate that we are already nudging 500m above sea level, but it is only when the road, which has for some kilometres carried us on a simple straight bearing, begins to twist and turn back on itself that the elevation starts to feel real. With each switchback my gaze is drawn towards the valley floor, far further away than it has any right to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winding and dining</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A light lunch?

This is when the ravine walls draw in, the road roughens and the carefully carved hairpins give way to national park. Signs of civilisation become fewer and further between, and the gaps between politely passing vehicles increase. The scenery is cinematic and it seems appropriate that we should come across a film crew shooting… well, we’re not quite sure what, though Eva has heard a rumour that it might be <em>Indiana Jones 5</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we break to refuel ahead of the push for the Pico, Google tells me Harrison Ford is in fact shooting in Buckinghamshire. It could, however, be Netflix fantasy <em>The Witcher</em>, set in the middle ages, or Amazon Studios’ modern-day Jack Ryan spy thriller. Gran Canaria belongs to any time.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>It actually doesn’t snow very often on Pico de las Nieves, but you will want to wrap up warm.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Not for the first time on a <em>Cyclist</em> assignment, I make entirely unsuitable lunch choices. I order Canarii speciality <em>papas arrugadas</em> – potatoes that are boiled in highly salted water, left to cool to form a wrinkly crust then doused in the chilli garlic sauce <em>mojo rojo</em>. I might as well be filling my pockets with pebbles.

Grey-green, semi-desert flora is replaced by a spectrum of autumnal hues, from shimmering gold to La Vuelta leader red. Leaves no longer remain reliably in post but carpet the roadside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s here that Eva suffers a mechanical that, while not catastrophic, will confine her to the small ring for the rest of the ride. We still have some kilometres to climb, so she won’t miss the bigger gear for a while yet, but it is sure to frustrate when she wants to pick up speed on the way down. While she’s confirming that it is indeed irreparable, I slip a couple of Canary chestnuts into my jersey.

These days this natural crag is a protected space and a rural park, and offers sprawling views of the island’s dramatic landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not possible to get all the way to Roque Nublo itself by bike, but the official walking route starts from a car park on the main road that you’ll pass 37km into our route (and again at 65km coming the other way), so if your shoes are up to it, the 1.5km walk up is a worthwhile mid-ride side quest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, make a day of it and come here separately without the bike – this area is a hiking hotspot known for its spectacular vistas and abundant flora and fauna.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Gran Canaria\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/big-ride-gran-canaria-14.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>In the drops for the rapid descent towards the southeastern shores.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> flew direct to Gran Canaria, which is four hours and 20 minutes from London. Gran Canaria is also reachable from airports in Manchester, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Nottingham, Bristol, Belfast, Norwich, Leeds, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Doncaster, Newcastle, Exeter, Glasgow and Aberdeen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first part of our stay we were based at the Gloria Palace San Agustín Thalasso &amp; Hotel (<a href=\"https://www.gloriapalaceth.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">gloriapalaceth.com</a>), just 20 minutes’ drive down the coast from the airport, on the southern part of the island. The hotel has a pool (with poolside bars), generous dining options and an on-site branch of Free Motion Bikecenter, offering rentals and a fully equipped workshop for bike servicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the second part of our trip <em>Cyclist</em> stayed at the Resort Cordial Santa Águeda (<a href=\"https://becordial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">becordial.com</a>) on the other side of Maspalomas. Each individual holiday home offers plenty of space, with the rooftop infinity pool providing the perfect place to unwind after a long, hard day in the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to Ana and Carmen at Gran Canaria Tri, Bike &amp; Run (<a href=\"https://grancanariatribikerun.com/\" target=\"_blank\">grancanariatribikerun.com</a>) for their immaculate organisation of our week. Thanks to Eva for her expert guiding, and for magically producing the sweetest mango I have ever tasted after our ride. Thanks also to the staff at Resort Cordial Santa Águeda for advising us on where we would be able to watch the England match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 140 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gran-canaria-cycling\">Flight of the Canaries: Gran Canaria Big Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"107b04905a4656663ea7edd8c0f47f14ce13ddaf3e987df96bbeb3b5680e9803","category":"Cycling"}
