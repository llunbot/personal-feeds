{"title":"macOS 15 and iOS 18 to get Settings, Control Center revamp","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2352872/macos-15-ios-18-system-settings-control-center-revamp.html","date":1717172673000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, we heard about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2343754/systems-settings-to-get-an-interface-tune-up-in-macos-15.html\">tweaks that Apple will make to System Settings in macOS 15</a>. In case you’re wondering if the changes are really going to happen, a quick X post late on Thursday by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman backed up the initial report by AppleInsider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while AppleIsider’s report focused on macOS 15, Gurman’s post refers to the upcoming iOS 18, as well. Gurman states that Settings is “getting a new UI with a reorganized, cleaner layout that’s more simple to navigate. It also has much-improved search.” Gurman’s post makes it sound as if Apple is doing more to unify the look of Settings between macOS and iOS, which was the original idea when Apple introduced the changes <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/803390/macos-ventura-system-preferences-settings.html\">from System Preferences to System Settings in macOS Ventura</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to AppleInsider, System Settings in macOS 15 will have sections in the left column reorganized so that it’s easier to find settings that are more frequently accessed. Also, some settings will be consolidated into other settings, such as Wallpaper. Gurman’s post makes it sound as if somewhat more drastic changes could be in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people using macOS 15 and iOS 18 keep mentioning the revamp to Settings. Obviously not a huge deal, but it’s getting a new UI with a reorganized, cleaner layout that’s more simple to navigate. It also has much improved search. There are also updates to Control Center.</p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1796399911526920509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2352872-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also notes that Control Center is getting updates, but no specifics are provided, nor has any other outlet reported on the new Control Center. (Hey Apple, how about letting third-party apps access Control Center? That’d be cool!) Gurman publishes his <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on&amp;xcust=1-1-2352872-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Power On newsletter</a> every Sunday, so perhaps he will provide more details then. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to reveal the new features for iOS 18 and macOS 15 at WWDC24, which will have its keynote address on June 10. The conference is expected to have an AI focus, demonstrating features that use AI.
