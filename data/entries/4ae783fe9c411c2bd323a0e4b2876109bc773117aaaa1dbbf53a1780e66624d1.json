This means sub-6.8kg bikes and exotic ultralight components are the norm – you really can run whatever you want so long as it’s not a trike or recumbent.</p>\n<p>We were at this year’s event and have picked out six of the most exciting builds – from a bespoke hill climb-specific steel bike to the fairly conventional Rose that won the men’s event, there’s something in here for every flavour of bike nerd out there.</p>\n<p>We also have a separate gallery on Rebecca Richardson’s amazing 4.7kg Specialized Aethos coming tomorrow – stay tuned for more.</p>\n<h2>Rick Bailey’s custom 5.6kg Gritspoke steel hill climb bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This custom hill climb bike is unlike anything we’ve seen before.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Rick Bailey (Team Lifting Gear Products / Cycles In Motion) – owner of Gritspoke, a small frame builder based in Sheffield – rode to a time of 4:12:8 onboard this custom steel bike.</p>\n<p>The unconventional geometry is said to be similar to a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time trial bike</a>, with a steep seat tube angle, short head tube and short rear centre.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The steel frame has a tiny head tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar, Bailey explained the short back-end helps to “keep the weight of the rider more over the rear wheel, helping to maintain grip when climbing out of the saddle”, which can reduce the chance of wheel spin on the typically wet and greasy roads of the UK hill climb season.</p>\n<p>The short front-end is also designed to maintain an aggressive position on steep roads, where a conventionally-sized head tube can feel “lofty”, according to Bailey, and you can end up wrestling with the front of the bike to keep it down.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A carbon integrated seat mast is Gritspoke’s signature feature.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Bailey was further keen to stress that, as the bike is photographed on the flat, it looks a bit strange but “put it on a steep gradient and it makes sense” – a hill climb-specific bike if there ever was one.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The custom seat mast topper is made by Bailey in his Sheffield workshop.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>The frame is constructed from fillet-brazed tubing (the exact tubeset wasn’t specified) and is paired with a custom, carbon integrated seat mast.</p>\n<p>This is a signature design of Gritspoke and is seen across all of its drop-bar bikes. The seat mast topper is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQavIHoB-7E/\" target=\"_blank\">a custom design</a> produced in-house by Gritspoke.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bailey cut down his cog selection to the bare minimum for the race.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike is based around a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-9000-group-review/\">Shimano Dura-Ace R9000 groupset</a> run in a 1× setup with a 38t chainring up-front.</p>\n<p>The cassette has been stripped down to just four cogs to reduce weight and improve the chainline of the bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Despite its odd looks, Bailey said the bike feels like “being strapped into a fighter jet”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike is fitted with a set of tubular Zed Wheels, built with Berd String Spokes.</p>\n<p>According to the brand, these spokes are made from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene and are said to be both lighter and stronger than conventional steel spokes. These are fitted with a pair of Pirelli P Zero Race SL tubular tyres.</p>\n\n<h2>Tom Bell’s Rose X-Lite</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tom Bell won the men’s event on board his Rose X-Lite.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Tom Bell (High North Performance) triumphed on the day, putting seven seconds into the time set by 2020 and 2021 national champion, Andrew Feather, to win the men’s race.</p>\n<p>Bell rode the same Rose X-Lite that took him to second place last year, with a few select mods for this year’s course and conditions.</p>\n<p>Last year, Bell used a pair of Shimano XTR SPD <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-pedals/\">mountain bike pedals</a> as he found he could clip into them faster than a typical single-sided road pedal from a standing start.</p>\n<p>With relaxed Covid restrictions allowing for the luxury of a marshall to hold riders at the start line, Bell switched back to a pair of super lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/time-xpresso-15-pedals-review/\">Time Xpresso 15 pedals</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bell runs a mechanical Shimano Ultegra groupset on his bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Bell’s bike is built with a mechanical <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-ultegra-r8000-groupset-review/\">Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset</a> set up in a 1× arrangement. The 170mm crankset is fitted with a 38t Wolftooth chainring and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/stages-power-lr-shimano-ultegra-r8000-review/\">Stages power meter</a>.</p>\n<p>The stock Ultegra brakes have also been swapped for a set of lighter Fouriers BR-DX001 brakes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bell made a last minute switch to a Giant wheel fitted with a rain-specific Pirelli tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Bell ran an unidentified tubular front wheel fitted with a Vittoria Corsa Speed tyre.</p>\n<p>Out back, he made a last-minute switch to a Giant SLR 1 30mm-deep wheel fitted with a Pirelli P Zero 4S tyre. This tyre is designed specifically for riding in wet conditions and, given the wild weather seen on the day, seems like a canny move.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bell took the men’s course record on the day, which had stood for 55 years.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Finally, a MT Zoom seatpost and stem are paired with an MCFK saddle and uncut unidentified bars.</p>\n<p>While very light at 5.7kg, Bell’s bike doesn’t stand out as particularly extraordinary or flashy. As much as we love poring over lightweight tech, if you want to be a hill climb superstar, it ultimately boils down to performance, pacing and training.</p>\n<h2>Bithja Jones’s Tifosi Mons</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bithja Jones rode the same Tifosi Mons as last year to retain her crown as national champion.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Bithja Jones (Pankhurst Cycles) retained her national title in the women’s event, setting a time of 4:00:4 on the same Tifosi Mons she rode last season.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jones forgoes both tape and drops in a bid to save weight.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Her bike is built with a Campagnolo Record 10-speed groupset, with titanium bolts fitted wherever possible to shave off every possible gram of weight.</p>\n<p>The left-hand shifter has also been gutted of its internals to save a little bit of weight.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jones switched to a set of shallow alloy clinchers for this year’s race.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Up-front, Jones is running a 10-speed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-ultegra-6700-groupset-review/\">Shimano Ultegra 67000</a> crankset. Unusually for a hill climber, Jones is running with no <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meter</a>.</p>\n<p>Jones made a switch from her Fulcrum Speed 55 wheels in favour of a pair of Fulcrum Racing Zero C17 alloy clinchers. These were fitted with a pair of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/continental-grand-prix-5000-clincher-tyre-review/\">Continental GP5000 tyres</a>.</p>\n<h2>Peter Greenhalgh’s 1966 National Championships-winning fixed gear FH Grubb</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Peter Greenhalgh rode this frame to the win at the 1966 National Championships.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Peter Greenhalgh rode this fixed gear FH Grubb to take the win and course record on Winnats Pass at the 1966 UK Hill Climb National Championships.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> His son, Mark, still rides the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Peter’s son, Mark (pictured), has since rebuilt the bike to better suit day-to-day riding, but the frame, hubs and bars are the same as those ridden by his father 55 years ago.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mudguards may look out of place now but, at the time, Peter Greenhalgh rode to and from the event on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>FH Grubb was originally based in London but the brand name was bought by Holdsworth in 1949.</p>\n<p>Holdsworth continued to produce frames bearing the moniker in the company’s Nottingham-based workshop until 1978.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These hubs were also fitted to the original bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Mudguards may look wildly out of place on a hill climb bike – however, Mark was keen to point out that, on the day his father took the record, he rode the bike to Winnats from his home in Nottingham (roughly 65 miles), took his mudguards off, won the race and then rode home.</p>\n<p>To put that effort into context, Greenhalgh’s record time of 3:11:2 had stood until Sunday, where only Tom Bell and Andrew Feather bested it. Heroic stuff.</p>\n<h2>Andy Nichols’ custom 2017 Orbea Orca OMR</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Andy Nichols rode this Orbea Orca OMR to third place on the day.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Andy Nichols (Team Lifting Gear Products / Cycles In Motion) took third in the men’s event with a time of 3:11:6 on his custom 2017 Orbea Orca OMR.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Nichols cut his cassette down to the bare minimum for the event.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>His bike is built around a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-ultegra-di2-r8050-r8070-hydraulic-groupset-long-term-review/\">Shimano Ultegra R8050</a> Di2 groupset run in a 1× setup with a 36t chainring up front.</p>\n<p>His rear derailleur has been modified with what we’re fairly certain is a budget-friendly <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32989159174.html\" target=\"_blank\">oversized pulley wheel system from AliExpress</a>. Like many riders, Nichols also trimmed his cassette down to just seven cogs.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Chopped bars are common in hill climb racing, where the drops are essentially useless on steep climbs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Nichols ran the same wheelset as his teammate, Bailey, but opted for a pair of Vittoria Crono CS tyres.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Nichols fitted his bike with a set of Ciamillo Lekki8 brakes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike is fitted with a pair of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/these-are-the-lightest-road-brakes-in-the-world/\">Ciamillo Lekki8 carbon brakes</a>.
