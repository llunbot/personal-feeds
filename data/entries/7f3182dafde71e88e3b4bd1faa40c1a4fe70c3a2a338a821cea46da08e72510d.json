The one that says, ‘If you can fix a bike then you can learn to fix a Lynx Mk2 helicopter’? For Chris Lord, the same logic applies, only in reverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I used to build aircraft engines,’ Lord tells <em>Cyclist</em> from his workshop in Cardiff. ‘I did my apprenticeship in it, but unfortunately I grew to hate it. Doing the same thing day in, day out – it was driving me insane. What I really wanted was to be creative and work with my hands.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alessandro-graser-cybro\">Meet the maker: Alessandro Graser of Cybro</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/richard-lambert-windover\">Meet the maker: Richard Lambert of Windover</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 144: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve always liked bikes. Gravel and bikepacking are what I do the most of, and I guess it was BMX that really got me into it. So framebuilding was just the perfect solution for me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In the beginning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lord built his first frame sometime around 2016, although he struggles to remember exactly when. Since then he has put his stamp on everything from bikepacking rigs to road bikes, which he’s been doing under his Lord Cycles brand since just before lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He specialises in custom bikes, working collaboratively with his customers to create one-of-a-kind machines that reflect their owners’ riding styles and personalities. It’s an intimate process that yields some intriguing results.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Lord Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The paintwork, for example,’ says Lord. ‘When I’m coming up with ideas for the designs, I get the customer to create a file of things they’re interested in, things they’re inspired by, and then from all of that imagery we just play around with a load of different ideas and develop it into something that ties everything together.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the case with the Jackson Pollock-inspired bike you see here. This is a customised version of Lord’s Antur gravel bike, which is designed to tackle all types of terrain. It was built for a customer called James, who liked the idea of having two bikes rolled into one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He wanted a gravel bike to take the place of his two existing bikes, both of which were pretty similar and neither of which really suited him all that well,’ says Lord. ‘He was after something that fitted him like a glove and that would be the only bike he’d need. The idea for the project was to create an “n-1” bike instead of the standard “n+1” bike.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Lord Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘He also wanted to be able to run the bike single-speed. He grew up riding a single-speed mountain bike and wanted to give a nod to his roots. It gives the bike another cool little playful element.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sliding<strong> </strong>dropouts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike can switch between single-speed and a multi-speed groupset thanks to a pair of sliding dropouts from Paragon Machine Works in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They make it super-easy to convert the bike to single-speed,’ says Lord. ‘Obviously you have to fit the new wheel, but the brake mount, the hanger and all of that stuff is attached to the slider, so that all moves as one as you adjust it. It means you don’t have to set up the brakes or anything. It just comes as one piece. Loosen the allen key bolt and you’re able to adjust the tension like that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As lovely as those dropouts are, what really makes this frame pop is the eye-catching paintjob. Lord does all the design work himself, then partners with a local painter to execute the messy side of things.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Lord Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/meet-the-maker-lord-cycles-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The colours were all chosen to match James’s frame bags,’ says Lord. ‘That was the main idea behind it. He also wanted something that would tie in with his local riding, which often involves quite dusty, sand-coloured terrain. That was how  the colour scheme was born.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the Jackson Pollock element, that came from the mood board file that James supplied when he commissioned the build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paintwork may be deliberately messy but the frame routing is designed for minimal fuss and faff.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The internal routing is a fully lined stainless steel tube, so it means you just poke the hose in at the top and it will feed nicely out the bottom. There’s no fishing around for the hoses or anything like that. Super-simple. Also, James wanted the option to be able to run dynamo lighting, so again that’s fully internally routed.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who like the idea of riding around on a custom bike of their own, Lord offers a number of build options across road, gravel and adventure.
