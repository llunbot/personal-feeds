These models\nare designed to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently,\naccurately, and responsibly. This report describes the model\narchitecture, the data used to train the model, the training\nprocess, how the models are optimized for inference, and the\nevaluation results. We highlight our focus on Responsible AI and\nhow the principles are applied throughout the model development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21075\">Available here as a PDF</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/09/apple-intelligence-foundation-language-models\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2d2ece89bc7ef376bc498225844239e5f2f8912b4601f37b2131649e284eac5a","category":"Tech"}
