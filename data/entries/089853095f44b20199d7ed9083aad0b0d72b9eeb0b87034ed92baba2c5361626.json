The affirmation comes on the heels of concerns highlighted by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> last month claiming that the developer labs have been \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/apple-vision-pro-developer-lab-attendance/\">under-filled with small amounts of developers</a>.\" Apple is not offering U.S. developer labs outside of Cupertino, which means any developer that wants to try the Vision Pro must travel to Apple's headquarters in California.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple refrained from directly addressing these reports, but Apple vice president of worldwide developer relations Susan Prescott pointed out that there was an \"extremely high, three-digit customer satisfaction for the labs that we've run so far.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSteve Sinclair, senior director of product marketing for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, also told <em>Digital Trends</em> that \"the number of SDK downloads has exceeded our expectations,\" purportedly indicating that Vision Pro has been very popular among developers.
