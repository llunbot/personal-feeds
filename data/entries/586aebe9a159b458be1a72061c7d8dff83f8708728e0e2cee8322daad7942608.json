The accessory was designed to provide simple access to Spotify music while in a vehicle, and it was especially useful in vehicles without modern infotainment systems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpotify <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/29/spotify-stops-making-dash-mounted-car-thing/\">stopped making Car Thing</a> just five months after it launched due to low product demand and supply chain issues. Existing Car Thing accessories continued to function as expected, until this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in May, Spotify announced that it was discontinuing Car Thing, and earlier this month, it told customers that the device would stop working at some point in December. Spotify says that Car Thing was discontinued in an effort to streamline product offerings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCar Thing cost $90 when it launched, and existing units are entirely non-operational now that Spotify has decided to brick them. Spotify has directed customers to recycle their Car Things.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/spotify-car-thing-officially-dead/\">Spotify's Car Thing Accessory is Officially Dead</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotifys-car-thing-accessory-is-officially-dead.2445072/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"586aebe9a159b458be1a72061c7d8dff83f8708728e0e2cee8322daad7942608","category":"Apple"}
