If you have a credit card, you can also view your remaining credit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo get the additional account information, your bank needs to support the Open Banking API that Apple has implemented. Supporting banks currently include Barclays, Monzo, Startling, HSBC, Lloyds, and RBS, with more banks likely to come on board when iOS 17.1 is released to the public.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following steps show you how integration is securely authorized through the Wallet app. It's a simple enough process, and Apple will automatically redirect you to your bank app to authenticate the connection. Note that until iOS 17.1 is officially released, <strong>the iOS 17.1 developer beta must be installed on your iPhone</strong> for this to work.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the Wallet app on your ‌iPhone‌.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap a card from a supporting bank.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Get Started</strong> under \"See Balances and Full Transaction History for This Account.\"</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Continue</strong> to connect your account to Wallet.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Check the account details that you are about to give Wallet permission to access, then tap <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>In your bank app, enter your ‌iPhone‌'s passcode or use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> to grant Wallet permission to access the specified account details.</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet.jpg\" alt width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter following these steps, you'll be directed back to the Wallet app, where you will now see the available balance of your account underneath the bank card, along with your transaction history. If it's a credit card, you'll also see the remaining balance available, while a tap on the balance will also reveal your credit limit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Wallet also keeps annual transaction histories for linked accounts. You can access them for each account in <strong>Settings -&gt; Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong>: Tap the connected account under \"Connections,\" tap the card under \"Accounts,\" then tap <strong>Account Activity</strong>, where you can view transactions by year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Apple users in the UK still unable to make use of Apple Cash or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a>, it's nice to see Apple exclusively supporting a British banking standard in its Wallet app. Note that Open Banking is UK-specific: No US equivalent is currently available.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/\">How to View Your UK Bank Account Balance and Deposits in Apple Wallet</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-view-your-uk-bank-account-balance-and-deposits-in-apple-wallet.2405247/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1f9cba6cab8b9a989b0c30bce1fd85c3f195d74253a0fec2082c6a1997efcf44","category":"Apple"}
