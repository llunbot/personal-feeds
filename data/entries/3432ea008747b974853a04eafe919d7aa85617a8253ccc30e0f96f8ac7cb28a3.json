It takes the Automobili Pininfarina Battista just 1.8 seconds to accelerate to 60 miles per hour. Yet somehow, that isn’t the most eye-popping detail about this hand-built Italian hypercar. Ditto its $2.5 million asking price.</p>\n<p>A quick refresher: Automobili Pininfarina is a spinoff of legendary design house Pininfarina, a company responsible for making some of the automotive world’s most gorgeous cars (and also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/vietnams-first-export-ev-vinfast-v8-makes-shaky-but-promising-us-debut/2/\">the VinFast VF8</a>). The Battista—named for company founder Battista “Pinin” Farina—is Automobili Pininfarina’s first product, and it shares its electric underpinnings with the Nevera, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/rimac-nevera-first-drive-an-entirely-new-level-of-hypercar-performance/\">a similarly hyperbolic supercar from Croatian brand Rimac</a>.</p>\n<p>Those EV guts consist of a T-shaped 120 kWh battery pack and four electric motors, one at each wheel. Max output is a yes-you-read-that-correctly 1,877 hp (1,400 kW) and 1,726 lb-ft (2,340 Nm) of torque, and while the aforementioned 1.8-second 0-to-60-mph sprint is ludicrous in its own right, even more impressive is that the Battista never lets up. It takes less than five seconds to hit 124 mph (200 km/h), and you’ll see 186 mph in just over 10 seconds. The Battista’s top speed? 217 mph (350 km/h). You’ll be there in no time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960866#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960866&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3432ea008747b974853a04eafe919d7aa85617a8253ccc30e0f96f8ac7cb28a3","category":"Tech"}
