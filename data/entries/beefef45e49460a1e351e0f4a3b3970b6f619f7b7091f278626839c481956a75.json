This is a super-long version of the newsletter because we did not publish last week, and there is just a ton of launch news of late. Also, I want to note that next week's report will appear a day early, on Wednesday, due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Speaking of which, you all have our thanks for reading and sharing the Rocket Report with others.</p>\n<p>On a completely unrelated note, Rocket Lab has had some amazing mission names over the years. But this weekend's \"Ice AIS Baby\" launch is probably the best. I always appreciate their effort to find non-vanilla names and find a way to stop, collaborate, and listen.</p>\n<p>Please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/rocket-report-next-vulcan-launch-slips-into-2025-starship-gets-a-green-light/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/rocket-report-next-vulcan-launch-slips-into-2025-starship-gets-a-green-light/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"beefef45e49460a1e351e0f4a3b3970b6f619f7b7091f278626839c481956a75","category":"Tech"}
