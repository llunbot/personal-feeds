Attackers affiliated with multiple ransomware syndicates—including Storm-0506, Storm-1175, Octo Tempest, and Manatee Tempest—have been exploiting the flaw for months in numerous post-compromise attacks, meaning after the limited access has already been gained through other means.</p>\n<div><div></div></div>\n<h2>Admin rights assigned by default</h2>\n<p>Full administrative control of the hypervisor gives attackers various capabilities, including encrypting the file system and taking down the servers they host. The hypervisor control can also allow attackers to access hosted virtual machines to either exfiltrate data or expand their foothold inside a network. Microsoft discovered the vulnerability under exploit in the normal course of investigating the attacks and reported it to VMware. VMware parent company Broadcom <a href=\"https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24505\">patched</a> the vulnerability on Thursday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039863#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039863&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"03009a65fd3db6489bca0118f4740c98728dfd5a982fff7ba2ea7ec1d863bb6f","category":"Tech"}
