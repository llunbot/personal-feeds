The event was organized by the China Computer Federation (CCF), one of the most influential professional developer communities in China.</p> \n<p>At CED 2024, I spoke about how AI development tools can improve developer productivity. I was honored to receive a certificate of excellence from CCF, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/?nc2=h_ql_prod_l1_q\">Amazon Q</a> garnered significant attention from the attendees.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/04/IMG_6571-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/10/04/IMG_6571-1024x681.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" /></a></p> \n<p>Now, let’s turn to other exciting news in the AWS universe from last week.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Last week’s launches</u></strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-q-business-hipaa-eligible/\">Amazon Q Business is now HIPAA eligible</a> –</strong> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/\">Amazon Q business</a> has received <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/\">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a> certification. This means healthcare and life sciences organizations such as health insurance companies and healthcare providers can now use Amazon Q Business to run sensitive workloads regulated under the US HIPAA law.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/nice-dcv-amazon-dcv-20240-ubuntu-2404/\"><strong>NICE DCV renames to Amazon DCV</strong></a> – NICE DCV is rebranded to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/dcv/\">Amazon DCV</a>. This high performance remote display protocol allows secure delivery of remote desktops and application streaming from any cloud or data center to any device, even over varying network conditions. Amazon DCV supports both Windows and major Linux distributions on the server side. Clients can use native DCV client for Windows, Linux, or macOS, as well as web browsers, to receive desktops and application streamings. The DCV server and client only transfer encrypted pixels, not data, ensuring no confidential information is downloaded. When using Amazon DCV on AWS with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc2=h_ql_prod_cp_ec2\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a>, you can take advantage of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/\">AWS 108 Availability Zones across the 33 geographic Regions and 31 local zones</a>. The 2024.0 release now supports the latest <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/blog/tag/ubuntu-24-04-lts\">Ubuntu 24.04 LTS</a>.

It expands the available AWS knowledge base, and community experts will earn reputation points by reviewing the AI-generated answers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-timestream-influxdb-advanced-configuration/\"><strong>Advanced configuration with Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB</strong></a> – This new launch introduces a feature that allows uses to monitor instance CPU, memory, and disk utilization metrics directly from the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">AWS Management Console</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-stop-ingestion-jobs/\">A new stop ingestion API of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a></strong> – This new API allows users to halt ongoing ingestion jobs at will. Providing greater control over data ingestion workflows, users can quickly stop accidental or unwanted ingestion processes without waiting for completion. By using the new StopIngestionJob API, you can respond rapidly to evolving needs and potentially reduce costs. This capability is available across all <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region\">AWS Regions</a> where <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a> are offered.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-appstream-2-0-increases-application-settings-storage-limit/\">Higher storage limit of Amazon AppStream 2.0</a></strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/\">Amazon AppStream 2.0</a> has expanded the default size limit for application settings persistence from 1 GB to 5 GB.
