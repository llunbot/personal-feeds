Whether you prefer to carry water in hydration bladders or bottles, you carry the bare minimum of tools and gear, or bring everything but the kitchen sink, there are hip packs designed to suit every need and preference. From minimalist packs for quick backyard laps to cavernous models for all-day epics, and everything in between, there are more great options than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many mountain bike hip packs to choose from, finding the right one can be a challenge. To help navigate the choices, we rounded up a diverse selection of 11 models for side-by-side testing and comparison. We loaded each pack up with water, tools, and gear to assess their cargo capacity, hydration capabilities, and organizational layouts before hitting the trails to analyze their comfort, stability, and performance while riding.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top mountain bike hip pack recommendations are listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are also great options that are worthy of consideration.

Hip Pack Pro 3L + 1.5L Bladder</a> has enjoyed a long run as one of the most highly regarded mountain bike hip packs on the market. Though there are many imitators, the Hip Pack Pro still deserves a place at the top for its excellent comfort, stability when riding, well-executed storage, and the option to carry water in the included 1.5L bladder, bottles, or both. </p><p></p><p>One of the best features of the Hip Pack Pro (and what differentiates it from the standard Hip Pack 3L) is the broad, stretchy, overlapping waist belt that hugs the body and makes it not only very comfortable but impressively stable in use. Unlike simpler strap designs that are static, this one is a little bit dynamic, so it moves well with the body and doesn’t dig in anywhere, even with the pack fully loaded. The waist belt also widens as it meets the main body of the pack, making a larger contact area where the wings cradle the hips. Also helping to enhance comfort is the well-executed Airflow back system with open mesh atop deep ventilation channels that keep air moving as well or better than any other model we’ve tried. The <em>Ventiflap</em> feature also allows you to adjust how closely the pack sits to your back with the pull of a string for extra ventilation on the climbs, and even <em>Airo Flex</em> the waist belt allows air to pass through.</p><p></p><p>The Hip Pack Pro 3L has, you guessed it, 3 liters of storage capacity. The pack has 2 primary zippered compartments with the main one housing the included 1.5-liter bladder (it is also sold <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J5KMXZ8/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">without the bladder</a> for less) behind a nylon sleeve along with adequate space for a packable layer, spare tube, mini-pump, or other larger items. The front compartment folds down for quick, easy access with 3 mesh storage pockets to organize tools and a zippered internal pocket for valuables. Two sizeable pockets on the hip wings provide additional storage space for snacks or smaller phones and there’s a key clip inside too.</p><p></p><p>The 1.5-liter bladder has a slide-open top that makes it easy to fill and clean, and the hose has a quick connect fitting that makes removing it from the pack super easy. If that isn’t enough water, there are two expandable mesh bottle holders with retention cords that hold bottles securely. Impressively, even when fully loaded with water, tools, and other gear, the back panel of the pack retains its structure well, and if you’re carrying less, the side compression straps can be used to snug it up and keep it tidy. </p><p></p><p>Overall, we don’t think it gets much better than the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-hip-pack-pro-3l-with-1.5l-bladder\">Evoc Hip Pack Pro 3L</a>.

With excellent comfort, great stability, a good storage layout that includes two water bottle sleeves, a smart built-in external strap system, and a $69 price tag, it represents the best ratio of performance and price of any model we tested.</p><p></p><p>While the Dirt Roamer is a medium-volume, 3-liter pack, we were consistently surprised by how much we could fit into it. With minimal padding and stretchy materials, it adapts to larger loads than expected, and the well-designed external strap system makes it easy to attach knee pads or a jacket on the outside. The main, top entry pocket is surprisingly roomy, with two open compartments against your back for tools and a large open area for snacks, a first aid kit, or other bulky items. The smaller zippered front pocket holds a phone safely and has a key hook so you’ll be able to drive home even if you forget to zip it up. Lastly, two zippered hip pockets are surprisingly spacious and allow for quick and easy access to snacks and other essentials while you ride. </p><p></p><p>Two bottle sleeves, one on each side of the main compartment, are quite easy to reach and fit standard-size water bottles snugly and securely with retention cords that keep them in place no matter how rough the trail gets. Depending on your needs you can carry two, one, or no bottles, and the bottle sleeves can also double as a place to stash a light packable layer. Even when fully loaded with gear and water, we found the Dirt Roamer to be exceptionally stable, secure, and barely noticeable on our hips and back in all riding, hiking, and even running situations.</p><p></p><p>Patagonia is often associated with high-end products and correspondingly high prices, but at $69, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fdirt-roamer-mountain-bike-waist-pack-3-liters%2F48510.html%3Fdwvar_48510_color%3DLTPG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-packs-gear\">Dirt Roamer Waist Pack</a> is one of the least expensive models we tested and a great value.

With only a main compartment with a small zippered section inside of it, the Seral 4 prioritizes comfort through stretchy mesh hip bands, easy bladder fills with a convenient handle, and good stability with a slim design that sits in the small of your back.</p><p></p><p>The Seral 4 takes a relatively no-frills approach when it comes to storage. There’s a single zipper across the top to access the main compartment that comprises the entirety of the pack’s carry capabilities. Inside this compartment, the 1.5-liter bladder sits closest to the back, separated from the rest of your gear by a small nylon sleeve. Otherwise, it’s basically just an open area to toss your stuff into, along with a small zippered internal pocket on one side to keep important things separated. The less refined design makes it a bit of a free-for-all storage-wise, but you can cram quite a bit into the 4-liter space. Even when fully loaded, the pack conforms nicely to the body and remains stable on the lower back, and when it isn’t full, compression straps tighten up the load. </p><p></p><p>The simple design continues through the hose routing, which exits the main compartment in an opening directly at the end of the zipper. This, along with the built-in bladder handle, makes it very easy to remove the bladder for refilling or cleaning. The handle is a great touch, making it easy to work with and hold the wide, flat bladder while filling. We typically prefer a quick-connect system where the hose meets the bladder, but the open design and easy hose routing of the Seral 4 make it unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>At $90 retail (often found on sale for less in previous year’s colors), the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F218242%2Fosprey-seral-4-hydration-waist-pack%3Fcolor%3DAPRIUM%2520PURPLE\">Osprey Seral 4</a> is a solid value, especially for those who might prefer the more open storage design.

The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fuswe-zulo-6l-hydration-pack\">USWE Zulo 6</a> is the largest hip pack they make with a 6-liter storage volume, a 1.5-liter hydration bladder, a super comfortable overlapping belt, and excellent stability while riding, even when fully loaded. </p><p></p><p>The Zulo 6 has a broad, overlapping waistband, similar to the Evoc Hip Pack Pro 3L but even wider. It wraps comfortably around the waist and distributes the weight and pressure more evenly for extra comfort, even with a heavier load. The “banana shape” of the pack gives it contours that conform to the shape of the body when wrapped around the hips, contributing to its stability in use and overall comfort. Compression straps keep the load close to your back, and the ventilated back panel does a reasonably good job of keeping things cool, although the extra width of the waistband does feel a bit warmer overall than those that are a bit narrower or more air-permeable. </p><p></p><p>The 6-liter storage capacity of the Zulo 6 is broken into two compartments. The main compartment opens wide and houses the 1.5-liter water bladder along with space for bulkier items like a tube, first-aid kit, mini-pump, and packable layer. The front compartment folds open to reveal three mesh sleeves and a zippered pocket for tools or other things you want to keep organized and easy to find when you need them. Zippered hip pockets on the waistband add additional capacity and on-the-go access to smaller items like snacks. While it doesn’t necessarily look as voluminous as the 6-liter capacity might suggest, we always found a way to get everything we needed in this pack, and the extremely stable and comfortable fit kept us riding with the Zulo 6L even when we didn’t need its full volume. </p><p></p><p>The Zulo 6 comes with a 1.5-liter hydration bladder that makes drinking while you ride a breeze. It does not have the capability to carry any additional bottles, but when combined with a bottle on the bike, we found it to be adequate for just about any length of ride. With a quick-connect fitting at the bladder/hose junction, removing it for filling or cleaning is a breeze, and the slide top opens up nice and wide for both as well. Getting the full bladder back into the pack is a bit of a squeeze, however, so we found it best to leave the bladder inside when filling most of the time.  </p><p></p><p>If you want the best of both worlds – to pack heavy but feel light in terms of pack stability and weight management, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fuswe-zulo-6l-hydration-pack\">USWE Zulo 6L</a> is one of the best options available today.

This low-profile model has a simple design that carries a single water bottle centered between two stretchy pockets that make up the 1.64-liter cargo capacity. </p><p></p><p>While the dual pocket design is not ideal for larger or bulkier items, you can fit a surprising amount of gear and snacks into them. You can easily fit a multitool, tire levers, CO2, a tube, and small snacks like candy bars, gels, or bags of fruit snacks. Where the pocket size can be limiting is with longer, flat items like cell phones or mini-pumps, but it swallows the essential tools well with a touch of room to spare for keys and a bit of food. It’s not really the ideal pack for rides where you’re carrying a spare layer, but we’ve seen riders stuff a super packable wind shell into one of the stretchy pockets in a pinch.</p><p></p><p>The central bottle sleeve holds a water bottle very securely, and it’s relatively easy to reach back and grab without needing to spin the pack toward the front. When used in combination with a bottle on the bike, we found it provided enough water storage for most short to medium-length rides. And, even when fully loaded with a bottle and gear, the Rapid Pack is the most stable and unobtrusive of all the models we tested, nearly going unnoticed while out on the trail. </p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for an affordable, sleek, and very well-executed hip pack to carry the essential gear plus a bottle, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F170007%2Fbontrager-rapid-pack-waist-pack%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Bontrager Rapid Pack</a> is worthy of serious consideration.

In fact, they’ve got a pretty big lineup of travel luggage as well as ski packs, hydration backpacks, and hip packs for mountain biking. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0898XQ658/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Thule Rail 4</a> is the largest of the three hip pack models they make with a 4-liter cargo capacity, a 1.5-liter water bladder, and a very well-organized and structured storage layout. </p><p></p><p>The main things that set the Rail 4 apart from the competition are the shape of the pack and the way that the storage is organized and compartmentalized. The structured design forces you to follow its organizational strategy to get the most out of the low profile, medium volume pack, but we were happy to adapt to the very well-considered layout. This isn’t the kind of pack you just stuff things into willy-nilly, instead, everything has a place, and when you pack it as intended, it results in a very tight and well-organized package. And, it also holds its shape, for better or worse, better than pretty much any other pack we tried, maintaining its streamlined rectangular look for a super tidy appearance.</p><p></p><p>With a velcro flap front pocket, centered zippered phone sleeve, and compartmentalized main pocket/bladder area, the Rail 4 is a great choice for organized riders looking to separate snacks, cell phones, and tools. This pack holds the essentials and you can squeeze a light, packable layer in there if needed as well. While it doesn’t have zippered pockets on the hip wings, there are two mesh pockets that Thule refers to as “jersey pockets” that are a great place for on-the-fly items like small snacks or gels. The zippered phone sleeve is also a nice touch as it keeps the phone separated from the rest of your gear in a soft pocket that’s relatively easy to reach back and access while riding or when stopped.</p><p></p><p>Even when packed full, the Rail 4 is stable and predictable, with the broad, overlapping mesh waistband holding it in place comfortably. The waistband is similar to those found on the Evoc Pro 3L, USWE Zulo 6, and the Deuter Pulse Pro 5, and it works in the same way to distribute pressure more evenly while keeping the pack from bouncing around over rough terrain.</p><p></p><p>The 1.5-liter bladder provides the water storage of the Rail 4 along with the unique <em>ReTrakt</em> hose management system. Instead of a tiny magnet, they’ve created longer magnetic strips on the hose and waistband that hold it super securely and make it very easy to remove and replace.

While hiking and skiing backpacks and luggage are their bread and butter, they’ve also been making a small line of mountain bike hip packs for several years. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B21NKW8V/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Pulse Pro 5</a> is their top-of-the-line hip pack and one of their latest models. With a 1.5L bladder, space for an extra water bottle, and an extremely usable, well-organized five-liter capacity, it’s our pick for longer rides and carrying lots of gear. </p><p></p><p>Interestingly, much like Evoc, Deuter makes the Pulse 5 and the Pulse 5 Pro with the “Pro” moniker denoting the overlapping waistband. This is an upgrade over the static belt and along with the highly padded back, it keeps the Pulse Pro 5 comfortable on longer rides. Given this pack’s greater cargo capacity, however, we found it to be a bit less stable over rough terrain compared to some other options when packed to the gills with water and gear. Not a deal breaker by any means, and the stability was also much better when carrying a lighter load. </p><p></p><p>The Pulse Pro 5 has 5 liters of cargo capacity, but surprisingly, it feels like you can pack more into it than the larger volume USWE Zulo 6, primarily due to the shape of the pack and the layout of the storage. The main compartment houses the wide, winged 1.5-liter water bladder and has ample room for larger items like a tube, mini-pump, and packable layer. The zippered front panel folds down to reveal two open mesh organization pockets for tools and one zippered mesh pocket for other small/medium-sized items. Moving outward, the rider’s left side has a water bottle sleeve with a retention strap and the rider’s right side has a small zippered mesh hip pocket that’s good for keeping a phone or other essentials easily accessible. Additionally, a stowable strap system is included to lash bulkier gear like knee pads to the outside of the pack.</p><p></p><p>The wide, wing-shaped bladder of the Pulse Pro 5 is nice in that it spreads the volume of water out into the hip wings and over a larger area in the pack. That said, it makes it more difficult to worm back into the pack when it’s full. Regardless, the slider top of the bladder opens nice and wide for filling and cleaning with a handle of sorts that makes it easy to hold open under the faucet. The hose also has a quick connect fitting and it secures on the waistband with a small clip that we found to be less likely to pop off than many of the magnetic attachments. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B21NKW8V/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Deuter Pulse Pro 5</a> is a great option for longer rides or heavy packers who like to carry lots of water, gear, and snacks. It’s not the <em>most</em> stable pack we tested, but it is quite comfortable and something we’d reach for all day over a backpack for rides where you’re bringing lots of gear. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B21NKW8V/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best of the Rest</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-3l-hip-pack-with-1.5l-bladder\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEVOC Hip Pack 3L + 1.5L Bladder\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$120</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>495 grams (w/ bladder)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Capacity</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>3 liters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water Bladder</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, 1.5L</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Water Bottles</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Waist Size</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>30” to 48”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2256\" height=\"1504\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Hip Packs of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L.jpeg 2256w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Evoc-hip-pack-3L-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Well ventilated back panel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great bladder management and quick release bladder/hose connection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Well organized</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Small hip pockets</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No water bottle carry option</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Difficult to tighten straps when the pack is on</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-3l-hip-pack-with-1.5l-bladder\">Evoc Hip Pack 3L</a> is a medium-capacity hip pack featuring a 1.5-liter water bladder in a fairly open top access area, a dual zip/velcro top closure compartmentalized section for tools and small items, and two small hip pockets, one with a key ring. It is quite similar to the Hip Pack Pro 3L detailed above, just without the stretchy waistbelt or any sleeves to carry water bottles.  </p><p></p><p>While there is nowhere to stash an extra water bottle, the 3-liter cargo capacity, smart organization layout, and 1.5-liter water bladder should provide just enough space and water to be prepared on short to medium-length rides. Organizing the essentials into the Evoc Hip Pack 3 is intuitive – larger items like a tube, mini-pump, and packable layer fit easily into the main compartment with the water bladder. Smaller items like a multitool, CO2 cartridges and nozzle, and tire plugs were easily organized in the compartments of the front, fold open pocket, a great area for anything that will live in the pack and you want to find easily. The small pockets on the hips are great for small items like snacks, chapstick, or keys, but they aren’t quite big enough to hold a phone.</p><p></p><p>The bladder is easy to remove, fill, and reconnect with the high-quality quick-connect fitting at the end of the hose. The slide top opens wide for easy filling and cleaning and has a great leak-free seal. The hose is attached to the waistband with a magnet and it is easy to reach, drink, and replace while riding. The grey color of the hose looks pretty cool, but it does hide any mold growing inside that would be more obvious with a clear tube.</p><p></p><p>Once loaded up, the small footprint and low profile of the Hip Pack 3L sits well in the small of the back, feeling very stable and secure. While the waist belt is not stretchy like the Pro version, it still feels quite comfortable in use. The strap system, while very secure and easy to get on and off, isn’t the easiest to adjust on the fly, however, as the slip lock slide buckles require some extra fiddling to tighten and loosen. </p><p></p><p>Beyond that, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-3l-hip-pack-with-1.5l-bladder\">Evoc Hip Pack 3L + 1.5L Bladder</a> is a great option that should serve most riders well.

While it is fairly small, the large main compartment, zippered phone sleeve, and two small hip pockets keep things organized while easily fitting all of the essentials, and the detachable bottle holder (it comes with one but can carry up to 2) allows you to carry ample water on your rides. </p><p></p><p>We love how the Rover is organized and constructed – a simple yet effective layout, comfortable back and hip padding, water-resistant Sailcloth fabric, waterproof zippers, and a dedicated, padded phone pocket. It feels very well made and durable, plus the materials provide great water resistance for riding in the rain or wet trails. The roomy main pocket opens nice and wide and holds more gear than expected given its 2.72-liter capacity with mesh pockets on both sides to keep things organized so you don’t have to fish around to find your tools. The neoprene-lined front pocket also keeps your phone relatively well protected in the event of a crash while the small zippered pockets on the hip wings provide easy access for items you want to keep in arms reach.</p><p></p><p>The PNW Rover comes with one detachable bottle holder and you can add an additional <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=19469&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingeditorschoice&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnwcomponents.com%2Fproducts%2Fbooster-bag-water-bottle-holder\">Booster Bag Water Bottle Holder</a> for $15, giving it water storage nearly on par with most packs that have 1.5-liter water bladders. Of course, you can also stuff a packable layer or other gear into the bottle holders to expand the cargo capacity. The only issue we really had with the Rover, however, is that when carrying bottles, they tend to swing around over rough terrain. This doesn’t really affect the pack’s stability, though we found it to be a bit distracting and something that could be improved on an otherwise stellar pack. We did find that you can mount the bottle holder inside of the compression strap for enhanced stability, though that doesn’t appear to be the recommended way to do it.</p><p></p><p>Still, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpnw-components-rover-hip-pack\">PNW Rover</a> is a great-looking and well-made pack that’s got your cargo-carrying needs handled for most rides. With good weather resistance and a tough, durable feel, we think it’s a solid choice that should last a long time and is great value at $79.

It hasn’t changed much over the years, but the recent redesign now includes a fleece-lined hip pocket that’s large enough to fit a phone for protection and quick and easy access while you ride. Otherwise, it’s a fairly straightforward pack that gets the job done and comes in way more color options than any other hip pack we know of. </p><p></p><p>The Hotlaps is available in 1, 2, and 5-liter capacities with the 5 also coming with a 2-liter water bladder. Whether you’re going for a quick local ride or out for a long day, the Hot Laps has the storage and hydration capacity for you to bring adequate sustenance and supplies. The storage consists of a large water bladder compartment that also has room to stuff some other items inside along with it. The front pocket opens nice and wide with ample space for bulkier items along with some organizational pockets and straps to keep it from becoming a free-for-all. Stowable straps on the bottom of the pack are there when you need them to attach pads or a jacket to the outside of the pack and the sizeable hip pocket on the right side of the waist belt fits a phone or a pair of shades.</p><p></p><p>The 2-liter capacity of the Hydrapak reservoir is more than most hip packs and provides ample water for just about any length of ride. It’s quite easy to pull out the pack and the slide-top closure makes it easy to fill and clean. The hose nests in a magnetic clip that’s easy to reach and replace whether you’re still rolling or stopping for a break. </p><p></p><p>The large hip wings and back panel are covered in <em>Airflow</em> mesh that provides decent breathability and relatively good stability. The one caveat, however, is that when this pack is fully loaded with gear and water, it tends to bulge a bit which results in slightly reduced stability.

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W1PGY2K/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Fox Standard Hip Pack</a> is a relatively low-volume, streamlined model with a 2-liter cargo capacity and two collapsible sleeves for water bottles. Given the limited storage, it’s best for shorter rides or carrying the essentials in warmer weather when you’re not bringing along spare layers.</p><p></p><p>The Standard Hip Pack has a very slim rectangular shape with storage split into two zippered compartments. The main compartment holds the bulk of the cargo capacity and is best for larger items like a tube, first aid kit, and a mini pump with small divider pockets to keep tools organized. The zippered front panel folds down to reveal a zippered mesh pocket and additional space for smaller items. The only real downside to the slim shape of the pack is that oddly shaped tools or snack containers may be more difficult to fit and there aren’t any hip pockets for those things you want to access on the go.</p><p></p><p>The two bottle sleeves hold regular-size water bottles and they collapse down when not in use to maintain the sleek looks of the Standard Hip Pack. You can carry up to 40 or 50 ounces of water depending on bottle size, which is roughly the equivalent of packs with a 1.5-liter bladder, and they’re relatively easy to reach back and pull out on the fly. We did notice, however, that with two full bottles, the pack had a tendency to bounce a bit over the rough stuff compared to some other options.</p><p></p><p>Overall, at $70 the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W1PGY2K/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Fox Standard Hip Pack</a> is an affordable low-volume option for bringing the essentials on your daily rides. With a well-organized 2-liter cargo capacity and the ability to carry up to two bottles, it has you covered for short to medium-length rides where you don’t need to bring tons of gear. Should you need more cargo capacity, Fox also makes the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FFox-5L-Lumbar-Hydration-Pack\">Lumbar 5-Liter Pack</a> ($125) which has 5 liters of storage space and comes with a 2-liter bladder. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W1PGY2K/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a><a></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comparison Chart</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Hip Pack Model</th><th>MSRP</th><th>Weight</th><th>Storage Capacity</th><th>Bladder</th><th>Bottles</th><th>Waist Size Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-hip-pack-pro-3l-with-1.5l-bladder\">Evoc Hip Pack Pro 3L + 1.5L Bladder</a></td><td>$135</td><td>562g (w/ bladder)</td><td>3 liters</td><td>Yes, 1.5L (also sold without)</td><td>2</td><td>31″ to 43″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fdirt-roamer-mountain-bike-waist-pack-3-liters%2F48510.html%3Fdwvar_48510_color%3DLTPG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-packs-gear\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer Waist Pack 3L</a></td><td>$69</td><td>245g</td><td>3 liters</td><td>No</td><td>2</td><td>27″ to 46″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F218242%2Fosprey-seral-4-hydration-waist-pack%3Fcolor%3DAPRIUM%2520PURPLE\">Osprey Seral 4</a></td><td>$90</td><td>442g (w/ bladder)</td><td>4 liters</td><td>Yes, 1.5L</td><td>No</td><td>27″ to 42″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fuswe-zulo-6l-hydration-pack\">USWE Zulo 6</a></td><td>$145</td><td>510g (w/ bladder)</td><td>6 liters</td><td>Yes, 1.5L</td><td>No</td><td>31″ to 40″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F170007%2Fbontrager-rapid-pack-waist-pack%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Bontrager Rapid Pack</a></td><td>$68</td><td>216g</td><td>1.64 liters</td><td>No (bladder version offered)</td><td>1</td><td>24″ to 42″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0898XQ658/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Thule Rail 4</a></td><td>$100</td><td>532g (w/bladder)</td><td>4 liters</td><td>Yes, 1.5L</td><td>No</td><td>31″ to 40″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B21NKW8V/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Deuter Pulse Pro 5</a></td><td>$125</td><td>710g (w/ bladder)</td><td>5 liters</td><td>Yes, 1.5L</td><td>1</td><td>25″ to 42″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-3l-hip-pack-with-1.5l-bladder\">Evoc Hip Pack 3L + 15L Bladder</a></td><td>$120</td><td>495g (w/ bladder)</td><td>3 liters</td><td>Yes, 1.5L</td><td>No</td><td>30″ to 48″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpnw-components-rover-hip-pack\">PNW Rover Hip Pack</a></td><td>$79</td><td>387g</td><td>2.72 liters</td><td>No</td><td>1 (up to 2)</td><td>24″ to 48″</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F185711%2Fdakine-hot-laps-5-l-bike-hydration-waist-pack-2-liters%3Fcolor%3DBLUE%2520HAZE\">Dakine Hot Laps 5L</a></td><td>$100</td><td>460g (w/ bladder)</td><td>5 liters</td><td>Yes, 2L</td><td>No</td><td>Not specified</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W1PGY2K/?tag=brbggearbikingmtbhippack-20\">Fox Standard Hip Pack</a></td><td>$70</td><td>370g</td><td>2 liters</td><td>No</td><td>2</td><td>Not specified</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why You Should Trust Us</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bikerumor, we love riding bikes, and one of the key elements of enjoyable bike rides is being prepared. Carrying the necessary tools to handle mid-ride mechanicals, enough water for the duration of the ride, adequate food to keep the energy up, and the appropriate layers for the weather, are all important things that can make or break the experience. Hip packs are one of our favorite ways to carry all the necessities, and we’ve been riding in them for years. While there are now more ways than ever to stash gear on our bikes, in cargo bibs, or backpacks, we still gravitate towards hip packs for their comfort, stability, convenience, and ease of use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this buyer’s guide, review authors Paul Clauss and Jeremy Benson personally tested the 11 hip pack models chosen for this review. Clauss is an avid trail rider, mountain bike coach, and trail builder who lives in northern Vermont. He’s been riding for many years and has a great appreciation for any gear that helps to enhance his performance and elevate his experience out on the trails. A mechanical engineer by trade, Clauss is particularly critical of the design and construction and he brings a very measured and logical approach to product testing. In addition to testing hip packs, Paul has tested and reviewed numerous other categories of gear including <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-dropper-post/\">dropper posts</a>, bike pumps, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">flat pedals</a>, and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-flat-pedal-shoes/\">best flat pedal shoes</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benson has been professionally testing and reviewing mountain bikes, components, apparel, and accessories for over seven years. He is an obsessive rider who spends an inordinate amount of time on mountain and gravel bikes training for races, riding for fun, and testing new gear. He’s been riding in mountain bike hip packs for the past decade and has seen them evolve from their humble beginnings into their more advanced forms. In that time, he’s personally owned five different hip packs and tested over 20 different models. As a full-time product tester, he is constantly scrutinizing every piece of gear he touches to tease out the performance differences that separate the best from the rest, whether that’s hip packs, the latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">mountain bike shoes</a>, or a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/\">hitch bike rack</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best mountain bike hip packs on the market, we rounded up 11 models to test and compare. Each model was weighed before examining their design, materials, and construction to assess the build quality and storage layout. Then, we loaded them up with all of the tools, gear, water, and food we could fit and hit the trails. While riding, we considered the fit, comfort, stability, and ventilation of each model when used with a full load on trails ranging from smooth and flowy to rough and rowdy. On rides ranging from quick laps at the local trail centers to all-day suffer-fests, we used and abused each model just like anyone else would. We got familiar with each model’s storage capabilities and hydration systems by filling and cleaning bladders and drinking from hoses and bottles. After months of testing, we compared notes and zeroed in on our favorites and those that perform well in specific ways compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Clauss testing the USWE Zulo 6 hip pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Tester Paul Clauss taking a break while out testing the USWE Zulo 6 hip pack.

What was previously a fairly non-technical accessory used primarily by tourists on vacation has developed into a relatively specialized piece of equipment that many riders rely on to carry the necessary tools, snacks, water, and other gear out on the trail. Hip packs represent a happy middle ground between the minimalist on-bike and body approach and a larger backpack, the latter of which can be sweaty, uncomfortable, and bounce around when riding technical terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying the hydration, food, and tools you need to keep riding in the event of a mechanical and to meet your basic human needs in a way that does not interfere with cycling movement is a classic challenge for mountain bikers and one that hip packs aim to overcome. Compared to most backpacks, hip packs are generally more stable, relatively small so they cover less of your back, and are worn around the waist so weight is lower on your body. They can also usually carry more water and gear than most people are able to strap to their bikes or stuff into pockets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many hip packs on the market these days with different styles, designs, cargo capacities, and hydration systems, finding the right one to suit your needs can be a challenge. For such a seemingly simple product, there’s a lot to consider when deciding what’s right for you. We’ll break down the important factors to consider when making a purchase decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bontrager-Rapid-Pack-capacity-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Cargo capacities vary from sleek, low-volume packs like the Bontrager Rapid Pack, or even smaller, to much larger bladder equipped models. (photo/Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cargo Capacity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bike hip packs vary pretty dramatically in their cargo-carrying capacity with models made to suit just about every need or preference. The capacity is typically measured in liters with super slim, minimalist, race-belt style packs starting around 1 liter, and high-volume models topping out around 7 liters plus a 1.5 or 2-liter water bladder. We tested 11 different hip packs ranging from 1.6 to 6-liter capacity, with the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F170007%2Fbontrager-rapid-pack-waist-pack%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Bontrager Rapid Pack</a> as the smallest and the USWE Zulo 6L as the largest. The right capacity for you depends on what you plan to carry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just need the essentials – your keys, phone, wallet, a tube, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-multi-tool/\">multi-tool</a>, water (in a bottle or bladder), and some CO2 – any of these packs will work with space to spare, with the Bontrager Rapid Pack being the most streamlined option at 1.64-liter capacity, followed closely by the 2-liter Fox Standard Pack. If you’d like a little more flexibility to carry additional food and some bulkier items like a mini-pump or a super-packable layer, models in the 3 to 4-liter range, like the PNW Rover, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-hip-pack-pro-3l-with-1.5l-bladder\">Evoc Hip Pack Pro 3L,</a> Osprey Seral 4, Thule Rail 4, or <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fdirt-roamer-mountain-bike-waist-pack-3-liters%2F48510.html%3Fdwvar_48510_color%3DLTPG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-packs-gear\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer</a> are good choices. And, if you’re a heavy packer, going for a long ride, or heading out in variable weather, packs with 5+ liters of capacity will be easier to stuff with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-jackets/\">packable jackets</a> and larger food items. The largest packs we tested are the Deuter Pulse Pro 5, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fuswe-zulo-6l-hydration-pack\">USWE Zulo 6</a>, and the Dakine Hot Laps 5L. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Deuter Pulse Pro 5 loaded up to show its capacity\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-capacity-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Larger capacity packs like the Deuter Pulse Pro 5 are much easier to load with more gear along with the 1.5-liter bladder and even an extra bottle. (photo/Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also important to note that most of the packs we tested feature highly usable compression straps, allowing the pack to be compressed when not fully loaded or to keep the load compact to prevent the contents from bouncing around inside. Compression straps can effectively decrease the volume of a larger pack, making it usable for rides when you need a lot of gear and those when you don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, despite our high priase of hip packs, sometimes even the largest models aren’t quite big enough for some people’s needs. Perhaps you’re going out for a huge adventure into the alpine where you need to bring a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-jackets/\">jacket</a>, layers, and extra food, or maybe an overnight bikepacking trip? Situations like these may require significantly more cargo capacity, and backpacks might simply be a better option. Bike specific backpacks come in a huge range of sizes and designs to meet vary needs, far more even than hip packs. Deuter, for example, makes 12 different models of bike backpacks ranging in cargo capacity from 8 up to 30 liters. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Looking inside the storage compartment of the Osprey Seral 4\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Osprey-Seral-4-storage-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Storage layouts vary from super simple designs like the Osprey Seral 4 seen here to those with multiple compartments and organizational pockets. (photo/Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Storage Layout</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly as important as the capacity, the storage layout of a pack dictates the organization of your gear and how you can use the space. Some packs, like the Osprey Seral 4, take a very simple approach, with a single large compartment with a zippered pocket within. Others, like the Deuter Pulse Pro 5 and Thule Rail 4, are highly compartmentalized, with separate zippered and open organization pockets and larger open sections. The split design of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F170007%2Fbontrager-rapid-pack-waist-pack%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Bontrager Rapid Pack</a>, and its small capacity, make it difficult to carry larger items in, while the more open designs of packs like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fdirt-roamer-mountain-bike-waist-pack-3-liters%2F48510.html%3Fdwvar_48510_color%3DLTPG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-packs-gear\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer</a> or PNW Rover make it easier to stuff bulkier items into them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to separate your food from your tools or keep your phone screen safe from scratches while riding, a more compartmentalized design might work for you. Some of the more organization-heavy designs rely on the user storing tools and other items in their separate pockets to get the most out of the space. It may take some getting used to, but once you’ve got your system, everything can have its place and be quick and easy to find when you need it. If you want a bag to toss the essentials into, zip up, and forget it, simpler layouts may suit you just fine. Like capacity, layout depends on what you need to carry and how you prefer to organize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Some of the storage layout and organizational pockets of the USWE Zulo 6\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-layout-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Packs like the Zulo 6 and many others feature organizational pockets to keep your items separated and easy to find. (photo/Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pockets on the hip wings of the waist belt are another factor to consider. Many packs have them, and they can be very handy to keep smaller items that you want to access on the fly without having to spin the bag around to the front. These vary in size, but most are good for smaller items like keys, gels, chapstick, or credit card/ID, while a few are capable of fitting a smartphone. Additionally, a few models, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F185711%2Fdakine-hot-laps-5-l-bike-hydration-waist-pack-2-liters%3Fcolor%3DBLUE%2520HAZE\">Dakine Hot Laps 5L</a>, Deuter Pulse Pro 5, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fdirt-roamer-mountain-bike-waist-pack-3-liters%2F48510.html%3Fdwvar_48510_color%3DLTPG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-packs-gear\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer</a>, have external strap systems that can be used to attach bulkier items like knee pads or a jacket to the outside of the pack for extra carrying capacity. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hydration Style</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most mountain bike hip packs provide the ability to carry extra water in additional water bottles, water bladders, and sometimes both. Like the overall capacity of the pack, the right water capacity depends on how much you drink and the duration of your ride. Having more water than you need is always better than not having enough. Of the packs we tested, 4 of them carry water in bottles only, 7 of them carry water in water bladders, and 2 of the models with bladders can carry an additional bottle or two. What works best for you is typically a matter of personal preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Patagonia Dirt Roamer hip pack with 2 bottles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-bottle-carry-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Some packs, like the Patagonia Dirt Roamer shown here, carry water comfortably and securely in bottles. (photo/Paul Clauss) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bottles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottle-carry models can usually handle one or two 20 to 25-oz bottles, which may be more than enough for your needs, especially if you’ve already got a bottle on the bike. Both the Fox Standard Hip Pack and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fdirt-roamer-mountain-bike-waist-pack-3-liters%2F48510.html%3Fdwvar_48510_color%3DLTPG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-packs-gear\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer</a> can carry two bottles in sleeves on either side of the storage compartment. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpnw-components-rover-hip-pack\">PNW Rover</a> comes with one detachable bottle holder, and you can add a second if you need to. The Bontrager Rapid Pack can only carry one bottle, but it does so very securely in the center of the pack between the storage pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to hydration bladders, bottles are super easy to fill and clean. For those packs that can carry two bottles, you can almost get the same amount of water capacity as a pack with a 1.5-liter bladder. For most of these packs, it’s also pretty easy to reach back and pull the bottles out of the pack for drinking, but not quite as easy as reaching a hose up to your mouth while riding. And, while most bottle holders are quite secure, there is the chance they could bounce out over super rough terrain or in a crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The winged water bladder of the Deuter Pulse Pro 5 hip pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Deuter-Pulse-Pro-5-bladder-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Many packs carry water conveniently in a hydration bladder inside the pack with a hose and nozzle for easy drinking, like the Deuter Pulse Pro 5.

The Thule Rail 4 has a unique magnetic strip connection that works super well. (photo/Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some advantages to bladder-style hip packs. Drinking from them is super easy and convenient. The hoses and nozzles are located on the waist belt, and reaching down and grabbing it to drink is quick and easy and can usually be done while riding on smooth sections of trail. The bladders are also soft and squishy, so they conform to the shape of your back and other contents in your pack and can distribute water weight more evenly, which can enhance pack stability. Bladders are carried internally, so they should never fall out on a rough trail, and you’re unlikely to set it down and forget it on the side of the trail like you could with a bottle. The disadvantages of bladders are that they are slightly more cumbersome to fill and clean, and bacteria and mold can grow in the bladder/hose/nozzle if neglected. Some people just don’t like drinking from a hose, and the hoses can occasionally pop loose while riding, which can be annoying and potentially dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Waist Belts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While they all perform the task of securing a hip pack around the waist, there are two main styles of waist belts on the packs we tested. Most packs come with a more basic, adjustable, static webbing belt with a plastic clasp to secure it.

(photo/Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other packs, typically the more expensive ones, have wide, overlapping velcro belts that also have a webbing strap and clasp over the top to secure it. This style of waist belt is found on packs like the Deuter Pulse Pro 5, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-hip-pack-pro-3l-with-1.5l-bladder\">Evoc Hip Pack Pro 3L</a>, Thule Rail 4, and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fuswe-zulo-6l-hydration-pack\">USWE Zulo 6</a>. Realistically, both styles work quite well and give little to complain about, but the softer, wider, overlapping models tend to be a little more comfortable, stable, and they distribute the weight of a loaded pack a little more evenly around the waist. The flip side is that they are a bit more finicky to put on, as you have to line up the overlapping straps before securing the buckle on top. Regardless, it isn’t that much of a hassle, and the added comfort and stability are generally worth the few extra seconds it takes to put them on. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The wide, overlapping waist belt of the USWE Zulo 6 hip pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/USWE-Zulo-6-waist-belt-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Several models of hip packs, like the USWE Zulo 6 and others, feature an extra wide, overlapping waist belt which is super comfortable and makes for a very stable pack. (photo/Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both styles of belts are adjustable to fit a range of waist sizes and keep them snug when in use. The designs vary somewhat, of course, but most are reasonably easy to adjust and stay secure while riding. The recommended waist size ranges also vary among the models we tested with some models like the Thule Rail 4 and USWE Zulo 6 fitting waists between 31 and 40 inches compared to the PNW Rover which is claimed to work for waists between 24 and 48 inches. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ventilation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to hydration backpacks, hip packs cover only a small portion of your back and are inherently better for staying cool and managing sweat. That said, they still make contact with your lower back where it can become quite hot and sweaty. Almost every hip pack makes some attempt at managing moisture where the pack makes contact with your body through the use of breathable mesh materials or more advanced ventilation systems, but they are not created equal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two Evoc packs, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fevoc-hip-pack-pro-3l-with-1.5l-bladder\">Hip Pack Pro 3L</a> and the Hip Pack 3L have by far the best ventilation among the models we tested with their <em>Air Flow Contact System</em>. The back panels feature raised, channeled foam blocks that are covered in an open mesh material that allows for superior breathability. Additionally, the <em>Venti-Flap</em> system allows the user to quickly loosen the upper part of the pack and create a gap between your back during climbs or other times you want to increase airflow, then quickly cinch it back down for the descents. The rest of the models we tested do a commendable job of promoting breathability and are generally much cooler and less sweaty than wearing a full-on backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Group shot of many of the packs we tested for the mtb packs buyers guide\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtb-hip-packs-group-shot-value-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The packs we tested vary in retail price from $68 up to $145, and all of them are solid options to carry your essentials out on the trails. (photo/Paul Clauss) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like anything else in mountain biking, hip packs vary pretty widely in terms of price. The more basic designs and those that carry bottles tend to cost a bit less. When you add a water bladder or fancier waist belt, the price goes up a bit. Of the models we tested, the $69 <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fdirt-roamer-mountain-bike-waist-pack-3-liters%2F48510.html%3Fdwvar_48510_color%3DLTPG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-packs-gear\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer</a> strikes us as the best value, and it happens to be our favorite bottle-carry pack too. Other models at the low end of our price range are the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F170007%2Fbontrager-rapid-pack-waist-pack%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Bontrager Rapid Pack</a> ($68), the Fox Standard Hip Pack ($70), and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpnw-components-rover-hip-pack\">PNW Rover </a>($79).That said, we also highly recommend the more expensive models, like the Evo Hip Pack Pro 3L and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmtbhippack&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fuswe-zulo-6l-hydration-pack\">USWE Zulo 6</a>, for their excellent comfort, stability, and ease of drinking while riding. Even though they are more expensive, you should expect to get several years of use out of them, assuming you don’t shred them in a crash or something. In fact, all of these packs should deliver years of faithful service under normal use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why should I get a hip pack for mountain biking?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Hip packs are one of several ways to bring your hydration and gear with you while you ride, and arguably one of the best. They allow you to bring more water, tools, and other gear than you can typically carry on your bike and in your pockets, so you can be well prepared for whatever you’ve got planned and most mechanicals that may happen along the way. They also keep everything in arms reach for convenient access, and most feature organizational pockets so your tools and other items are quick and easy to find when you need them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on what you need to carry while you ride, you can choose from hip packs with varying storage and water-carrying capacities to suit your specific needs. Many hip packs are also fairly adaptable and can carry lighter or heavier loads depending on the length of ride. Some of them can even fit about as much as many hydration backpacks. Compared to backpacks, however, hydration packs sit just above the waist on your lower back for a lower center of gravity, better weight distribution, and stability. They also cover significantly less of your back, allowing for better breathability and sweat management. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What size mountain bike hip pack should I get?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It really depends on what you want to bring with you on a ride. Taking stock of all the things you need to carry – water, tools (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-multi-tool/\">multi-tool</a>, pump/CO2, tube, tire levers, tubeless plugs, etc), food, phone, wallet (or money/card and ID), extra layers, pads, etc. – should give you a rough idea of the size pack you’ll need to fit it all into. And, it’s also important to consider that what you carry on rides may vary based on the length of ride or the season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who carry a water bottle on the bike and bring the bare minimum with them on rides may prefer a low-volume and low-profile option like the Bontrager Rapid Pack or Fox Standard Hip Pack. Most people will likely find the sweet spot in the medium-volume packs in the 3 to 4-liter capacity range, like the Evoc Hip Pack Pro 3L, the Thule Rail 4, and the Patagonia Dirt Roamer. Others who like to bring more on their rides, or who just like the option to do so, will be well served by looking at some of the larger capacity packs like the USWE Zulo 6L or the Deuter Pulse Pro 5. Again, it really just depends on the length of your rides and what you want to have with you out on the trail.  </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What’s better, a water bladder or water bottles?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>With the variety of hip packs on the market today, you can choose between models that carry water in a bladder, bottles, or both, or some that don’t carry any water at all. What works best for you really comes down to personal preference or your water-carrying needs, as both systems work quite well. Water bladders carry up to 1.5 or 2 liters of water, have a clean look inside of the pack, conform to shape easily for comfort against the back or cramming things in a pack around them, and allow for easy drinking (even while riding) from a hose. That said, water bladders are a little more annoying to clean. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottles are also quite easy to drink from and far easier to clean than bladders. Their storage location varies on the hip packs we tested with some being super stable while riding and others moving around a bit on the back, but you’ve almost always got to reach around to grab them which is less convenient than the bladder systems. Either way, you can’t really go wrong, but considering your drinking preference and water-carrying capacity needs will likely steer you in one direction or the other. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I clean/care for my mountain bike hip pack?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Hip packs tend to get dirty from sweat or when riding in dusty or wet conditions. Their location on the lower back means they are placed right in line of fire from tire spray and they can get caked with mud. In general, they don’t need to be cleaned very often, and you can typically wipe off dirt or mud and let them dry out between rides. Eventually, though, you’ll need to wash them, and it is quite easy to spray them down with a hose or hand wash them in the kitchen sink and let them air dry. Some packs can also be washed in a washing machine, but you definitely want to look up and follow any manufacturer’s recommendations when washing your hip pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more important is cleaning the hydration system. Bacteria and mold can and do grow in the moist environment inside the bladder, hose, and nozzle, so keeping it clean is important for your health and the taste of your water. You can use dish soap, brushes, and/or cleaning tablets to get through the hose and inside the bladder. You can also use baking soda, lemon juice, bleach, or even denture cleaning tablets to kill bacteria. And, be sure to let everything dry before using it again. There are lots of helpful tips that can be found online if you are unsure how to go about cleaning your hydration system. Whatever technique you use, be sure to clean your water bladder, hose, and nozzle regularly. Most bladders are not dishwasher safe – again, check with the manufacturer before using the dishwasher.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Can I shorten the hose on water bladder packs?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Yes! Pretty much any hydration hose can be shortened to your desired length. You can do this by pulling out the nozzle piece, cutting the hose to length with a sharp pair of scissors or a knife, and pressing the nozzle piece back in.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-multi-tool/\">\n\t\t<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Multi-Tools of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bike-multi-tools-lead-image-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-multi-tool/\">\n\t\tThe Best Bike Multi-Tools of 2023\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>It’s hard to imagine a cycling accessory that is more essential, affordable, or portable than the bike multi-tool.
