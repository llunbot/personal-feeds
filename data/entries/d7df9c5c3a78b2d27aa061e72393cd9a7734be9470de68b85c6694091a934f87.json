{"title":"1Password and Charging for SSO","link":"https://1password.com/daringfireball","date":1733694923000,"content":"\n<p>My thanks to 1Password — which, earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.kolide.com/blog/1password-acquires-kolide\">acquired frequent DF sponsor Kolide</a> — for sponsoring last week at DF. Imagine if you went to the movies and they charged $8,000 for popcorn. Or, imagine you got on a plane and they told you that seatbelts were only available in first class. Your sense of outraged injustice would probably be something like what IT and security professionals feel when a software vendor hits them with the dreaded SSO tax — the practice of charging an outrageous premium for Single Sign-On, often by making it part of a product’s “enterprise tier”. The jump in price can be astonishing — one CRM charges over 5000% more for the tier with SSO. At those prices, only very large companies can afford to pay for SSO. But the problem is that companies of <em>all</em> sizes need it.</p>\n\n<p>Until outraged customers can <a href=\"https://ssotax.org/\">shame vendors into getting rid of the tax</a>, many businesses have to figure out how to live without SSO. For them, the best route is likely to be a password manager, which also reduces weak and re-used credentials, and enables secure sharing across teams. And a password manager is likely a good investment anyway, for apps that aren’t integrated with SSO. <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/explaining-the-backlash-to-the-sso-tax/\">To learn more about the past, present, and future of the SSO tax, read 1Password’s full blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/08/1password-and-charging-for-sso\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d7df9c5c3a78b2d27aa061e72393cd9a7734be9470de68b85c6694091a934f87","category":"Tech"}
