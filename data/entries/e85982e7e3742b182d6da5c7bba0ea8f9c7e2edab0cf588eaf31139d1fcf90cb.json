The case drew plenty of attention and the bill was finally wiped out several days after the customer contacted the AT&amp;T president's office.</p>\n<p>The customer said he received the billing email on December 11. An automatic payment was scheduled for December 15, but he canceled the autopay before the money was charged. The whole mess took a week to straighten out.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/2-per-megabyte-att-mistakenly-charged-customer-6223-for-3-1gb-of-data/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/2-per-megabyte-att-mistakenly-charged-customer-6223-for-3-1gb-of-data/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e85982e7e3742b182d6da5c7bba0ea8f9c7e2edab0cf588eaf31139d1fcf90cb","category":"Tech"}
