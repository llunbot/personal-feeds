{"title":"All-time-low sale knocks $150 off the iPad Air","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2222005/all-time-low-sale-knocks-150-off-the-ipad-air.html","date":1706634431000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s likely a new iPad Air coming in just a month or two, but we don’t expect it to be all that different. So you might as well snatch the current model for a great price: Amazon is selling the iPad Air with 5G cellular for $600 (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V3GMN65/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">64GB</a>) and $750 (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V3KWM8F/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">256GB</a>), a savings of $149 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Air has a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display built around a gorgeous all-screen design. With 5G cellular connectivity (which requires a separate subscription from your wireless carrier), you’ll have a true mobile computer, with an M1 chip, a 12MP front camera with Center Stage, Apple Pencil 2 support, USB-C, and Touch ID. It’s also compatible with the 11-inch Magic Keyboard for a laptop-style experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming model is rumored to get a faster chip and better cameras, but the current model will still be plenty fast and more than capable of handling everything you want to do with it. SO go grab one now and save a bundle.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"aa5b5ed1bfa60b25676d19adfcc196ee43882d374b7284c588c7a52db9175020","category":"Apple"}
