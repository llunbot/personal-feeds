Europe continues to be an\nincredibly important market for Meta and we hope to make Threads\navailable here in the future,” it said in a statement provided to\nTechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier today, several EU-based users started posting screenshots\non Twitter indicating that they were not able to access the\nThreads app even after using VPN.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/110710840894433112\">Federico Viticci</a> (on Mastodon):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Threads has been down for me like this since last night. I’m in\nItaly. I can’t view my profile, notifications, or post. But I can\nread my timeline.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe they figured out a way to block some parts of the app in\nEurope? 🤷‍♂️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@levie/post/CurnRtuLgv_\">Aaron Levie</a> (on Threads):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why doesn’t the EU just turn off the web?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/14/threads-blocking-eu\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1b5b89e9d4abcb9ba7e73ff2ac2dac42aae1d5bc2c051511380b0cdb1c1855c9","category":"Tech"}
