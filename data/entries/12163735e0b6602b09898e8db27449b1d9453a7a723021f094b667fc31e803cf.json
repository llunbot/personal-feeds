It turned out to be a\nprescient move. On Wednesday night, Germán became just the 24th\npitcher in MLB history to throw a perfect game, using just 99\npitches to mow through 27 Oakland A’s batters without allowing a\nsingle baserunner.</p>\n\n<p>Entering the game with a 5.10 ERA in his first 14 starts of the\nseason, Germán completed the first perfect game since Félix\nHernández threw one for the Mariners in August 2012. There were\nthree perfectos thrown that year — by Hernández, Matt Cain, and\nPhillip Humber — but nearly 11 seasons had passed without one\noccurring.</p>\n\n<p>“Growing up, [Hernández] was my idol,” Germán said through a\ntranslator after the game. “I really looked up to the way he\npitched.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/german-perfecto\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"12163735e0b6602b09898e8db27449b1d9453a7a723021f094b667fc31e803cf","category":"Tech"}
