The former discount is the best we've seen since January, while the latter matches the lowest price we've ever tracked. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/08/grab-a-256gb-samsung-microsd-card-for-29-today/\" target=\"_blank\">we've noted before</a>, this certainly isn't the fastest card on the market, but it's reliable and performant <em>enough</em> for most casual needs, making it a good value when it's on sale.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, our deals roundup has a couple of steep discounts on <a href=\"https://fave.co/2WwBhux\" target=\"_blank\">Anda Seat's Kaiser 2</a> and <a href=\"https://fave.co/2WwKliw\" target=\"_blank\">T-Pro 2</a> gaming chairs. You can <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/chairs-technica-we-review-two-new-models-from-anda-seat/\" target=\"_blank\">read our review from earlier this year</a> for more details. While they're better suited for taller folks (think 5 foot 8 inches or more), people who can fit into them should find they provide sturdy frames and firm-but-generally-comfortable padding, regardless of whether said persons call themselves \"gamers.\" Again, they're particularly solid value at these prices.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, we also have deals on Apple's wireless MagSafe charger, recommended webcams, Razer's handheld Kishi game controller for iOS, a couple of AMD Ryzen processors, and more. You can see the full rundown for yourself below.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788833#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788833&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4f426caefbcb7060c2e6a7debd2e3f55693a091a8d87c2990ddfe4288d40f443","category":"Tech"}
