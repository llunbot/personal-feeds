{"title":"The Harris-Walz Campaign Logo Is Not Great","link":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91168459/new-logo-harris-walz-campaign","date":1723050920000,"content":"\n<p>On the whole I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/21/biden-out\">continue to think</a> it’s a tremendous advantage for Kamala Harris to drop into the race as a fresh candidate just three months ahead of the election, but I think this branding effort is one area that shows signs of being rushed. It’s not horrible but it’s not good. It’s just meh, and in no way memorable or distinctive. I don’t see how the two typefaces pair together <em>at all</em>. It’s has nothing like the <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Branding_HQ_Biden_Harris_Brand_Guidelines_UPDATED_081320_compressed.pdf\">cohesiveness of the Biden-Harris brand</a> from 2020 (and the first half of 2024).</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think the gist of this Fast Company story, suggesting the logo is a nod to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Chisholm#/media/File:Shirley_Chisholm_presidential_campaign_poster.jpg\">the branding from Shirley Chisolm’s groundbreaking 1972 campaign</a> for the Democratic nomination, is nonsense. “Harris” is presented in all-caps in a compressed sans serif typeface, yes, but it’s not even vaguely the same typeface. If anything, Chisholm’s branding was better, stronger, and more timeless — I wish the Harris branding was more like Chisholm’s. And it’s not like anyone in today’s US electorate actually remembers what Shirley Chisholm’s 1972 campaign posters looked like.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/07/harris-walz-logo\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ded83e258f2b7bcda559a4ddc340fae2b5e7e570d24a6a07d3f87c93460b01df","category":"Tech"}
