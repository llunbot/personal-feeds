In-store availability can be checked by zip code or postal code on the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth\">polishing cloth's product page</a> on Apple's website.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says the polishing cloth is made with soft, nonabrasive material and can be used to clean any Apple product's display safely and effectively, including those with nano-texture glass like the Pro Display XDR. Note that Apple already includes a polishing cloth with the Pro Display XDR, but it does not include one with other products.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThose who were quick to order the polishing cloth when it first became available last week are now beginning to receive their orders.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/polishing-cloth-unboxing-composite-normalized.jpg\" /><div><em>Photos shared by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Godicc0941/status/1452840362205057026\">Twitter user Godicc</a></em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe third-generation AirPods are <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MME73AM/A/airpods-3rd-generation\">also available for same-day pickup</a> at select Apple Store locations in the United States and some other countries today, as are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/26/get-macbook-pro-today-apple-store-pickup/\">select configurations of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/polishing-cloth/\">Polishing Cloth</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/26/apple-polishing-cloth-apple-store-pickup/\">Apple's Polishing Cloth and AirPods 3 Now Available for Same-Day Pickup at Select Apple Stores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-polishing-cloth-and-airpods-3-now-available-for-same-day-pickup-at-select-apple-stores.2319506/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Hj3PJQZNWrg:Av1ZWvaTk_E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Hj3PJQZNWrg:Av1ZWvaTk_E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Hj3PJQZNWrg\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"377a823fe20ff630a97e87006938f1228fa49f64f570168c582cf6131bfe35bb","category":"Apple"}
