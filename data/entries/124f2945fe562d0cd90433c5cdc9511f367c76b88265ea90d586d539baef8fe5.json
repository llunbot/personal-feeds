On the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, it also brings faster USB 3 transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s, provided you're using the right cable. ‌iPhone 15‌ models are limited to USB 2 charging speeds, the same as the Lighting port.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-c-port-apple-watch-airpods-charging/\">iPhone 15's USB-C Port Can Charge Your Apple Watch and AirPods</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-usb-c-port-can-charge-your-apple-watch-and-airpods.2401360/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"124f2945fe562d0cd90433c5cdc9511f367c76b88265ea90d586d539baef8fe5","category":"Apple"}
