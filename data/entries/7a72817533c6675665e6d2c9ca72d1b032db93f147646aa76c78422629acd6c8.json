So you’ll be sure to find something to fit your needs, whether that’s pumping your tyres up to 100psi quickly or getting your hands on a pump that will help you seat a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyre</a> easily.</p>\n<p>We’ve divided this list into the best track pumps and the best mini pumps.</p>\n<p>Track pumps are ideal for home use because they will make light work of pumping up tyres. Mini pumps are suited to taking out on rides in case you have to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fix-a-puncture-video/\">fix a puncture</a>, because they are lightweight and will fit in a pocket or frame bag.</p>\n<p>You can skip to the track pump or mini pump sections by hitting one of the following links:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"#besttrackpumps\">Skip to the best track pumps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#bestminipumps\">Skip to the best mini pumps</a></li>\n</ul><p>If you’re not sure which pump is best for you, keep reading until the end for our <a href=\"#bikepumpbuyersguide\">bike pump buyer’s guide</a>, where we take you through everything you need to know about this essential bike tool.</p>\n<h2>Best track pumps of 2023</h2>\n<h3>Lezyne Classic Over Drive</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hose is nice and long, which aids usability.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Use:</strong> MTB</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £60 / $70 / AU$200</li>\n</ul><p>The long, mid-volume barrel and quality metal construction help this Lezyne pump strike a great performance balance, with an easy action, smooth feel and low stroke counts. Although the gauge is at the base, it’s easy to read and accurate. The hose is long, and it’s easy to swap between valve types.</p>\n<p>It’s a shame that there’s no bleed valve for spot-on pressure adjustment and some won’t like the screw-on head, although we had no issues with the valve core working loose. Max pressure is only 60psi, which rules out use as a road pump.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/pumps/floor-pump/lezyne-classic-over-drive-track-pump-review/\">Read our full Lezyne Classic over Drive review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>LifeLine Professional</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> LifeLine’s Professional track pump is efficient, accurate and affordable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Use:</strong> Road, MTB</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £40 / $49 / AU$83</li>\n</ul><p>LifeLine’s professional track pump gets a 25mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/continental-grand-prix-4000-sii-review/\">Continental GP4000</a> tyre to 100psi in 25 strokes and was just 2psi out on our separate pressure gauge, which really doesn’t matter unless you’re very particular.</p>\n<p>The steel barrel, wooden handle, long hose and all-metal switchable chuck are very impressive for the price, and we’ve had one of these going strong for years without complaint.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized AirTool Comp</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Who knew pump handles could be aero?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Use:</strong> Road, MTB</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £50 / $70</li>\n</ul><p>The AirTool Comp ticks all the boxes in terms of functionality, with a head that accepts all valve types and a large base featuring grip tape for use in unfavourable conditions.</p>\n<p>A wide, ‘aero’-shaped handle adds ergonomics that you didn’t know were missing from a pump, while the analogue dial features a two-staged face, allowing for greater accuracy up to 30psi for high-volume tyres.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized AirTool MTB Floor Pump</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized’s AirTool MTB makes quick work of high-volume tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Julia Broussier / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Use: </strong>MTB</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£85</li>\n</ul><p>This MTB-specific track pump offers great efficiency, inflating a 29in tyre to 25psi in 23 strokes.

Despite this, many pumps seem to fall short of the mark. So we’ve put together this guide to tell you about the different types of pumps and what to look for when buying one.</p>\n<h3>Types of bike pump</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Checking tyre pressure before a ride is a habit worth getting into.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h4>Track pump</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Track pumps are one of the most efficient ways of inflating your tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Every cyclist needs a decent track pump (also known as a floor pump), and if you’re building a home workshop it really should be one of your first purchases. This style of pump will almost always offer a long flexible hose, pressure gauge and large chamber for quick air transfer.</p>\n<h4>Hand pump</h4>\n<p>While a portable hand pump (or mini pump) can be used as your only option, it really shouldn’t be your first port of call.</p>\n<p>Portable pumps are designed for emergencies or occasional use, and so are kept compact and light. With these size constraints come compromises.</p>\n<p>The main issue is that these pumps stress the valve stem, eventually leading to a leaking or useless <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tube</a>. There are pumps on the market that add a flexible hose to remove this issue, but you’re still left pumping longer than you would do with a track pump, and in many cases, not able to reach the ideal pressure.</p>\n<h4>Frame pump</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Frame pumps were the norm for many years.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Huang</i></span></div>\n<p>Effectively a longer, more efficient hand pump. A frame pump is designed to fit within the triangle of a bike frame. This allows the pump to be bigger, which often means a more effective hand pump. You’ll generally only find this style of pump on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-road-bikes/\">steel road bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-touring-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">touring bikes</a>.</p>\n<h4>CO2 inflators</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> CO2 inflators can save a lot of time and effort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jacob Gibbins</i></span></div>\n<p>You can inflate your tyres in a hurry with compressed carbon dioxide. This should only be used in case of a flat out on the road or trail though because the cartridges are expensive and wasteful.</p>\n<p>A common 16g cartridge will inflate a standard 700 x 23c tyre to about 100psi.</p>\n<p>An issue with these inflators is that you only have as many attempts as there are cartridges. A way out of this is with a hybrid pump, this combines both a CO2 inflator and hand pump together, so you can use the CO2 if you’re in a hurry or save it if you’ve got time.</p>\n<p>We have a list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/6-of-the-best-co2-inflators/\">best CO2 inflators</a> if this sounds like the right thing for you.</p>\n<h4>Shock pump</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shock pumps are essential for setting your mountain bike suspension correctly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you own a mountain bike with air-sprung suspension, it’s worthwhile investing in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-shock-pumps/\" target=\"_blank\">shock pump</a>. This high-pressure, small-volume pump will often have a max pressure of 300psi, allowing you to get the right pressure and then fine tune it.</p>\n<h4>Other options</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Fumpa Pump is a battery-operated, rechargeable electronic tyre inflater.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You could also consider a battery-operated air pump or air compressor.</p>\n<p>The battery-operated air pump is popular among professional cyclocross mechanics – its electric-drill shape makes it easily portable and inflating light work, but its maximum pressure is limited and the good ones are expensive. Other options, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenanace/pumps/fumpa-electric-pump-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Fumpa</a>, also exist.</p>\n<p>Air compressors are the go-to option in bike shops and are especially handy when seating tubeless tyres, but are more expensive, very loud and casual users will sooner reach for a floor pump than switch on the compressor.</p>\n<h3>Things to consider when buying a bike pump</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A pressure gauge might be worth adding to your tool collection if you run low pressures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h4>Pressure needed</h4>\n<p>Not many people really need a pump that goes to 260psi and even a committed mountain biker probably won’t need above 40psi. A higher-pressure pump is often a trade-off for volume output, or at least gauge accuracy. Because of this, brands such as Lezyne offer pump models specific to road or mountain biking.</p>\n<h4>Volume needed</h4>\n<p>Much like pressure, this will depend on your main bike choice. A high-volume pump will mean it takes fewer strokes to reach your desired pressure, but in turn, will generally mean a lower maximum pressure.</p>\n<p>As mountain bike tyres have far greater volume (and lower pressure), a large-volume pump is more important here. If you have tubeless tyres, a pump with a massive volume output may be enough to seat a tyre without needing an air compressor.</p>\n<h4>Gauge accuracy</h4>\n<p>Few hand pumps include a gauge, but any decent track pump should.</p>\n<p>Look for a gauge that’s easy to read and offers a suitable pressure range for your needs. Gauges are generally most accurate at the middle of the range, so if you’re trying to accurately inflate your mountain bike tyre between 23 and 25psi you’ll need a gauge with a low-pressure accuracy (or just a separate <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tyre-pressure-gauges/\">pressure gauge</a>).</p>\n<p>A pump with a digital gauge is also an option if you’re looking at more expensive options.</p>\n<h4>Pump heads and valve types</h4>\n<p>Presta (racing style) and Schrader (like on a car) are two of the most common valve types. Nearly all pumps these days will cater for at least Presta and Schrader, but not all are as simple as others.</p>\n<p>Some pumps are valve-specific, others must be changed internally to fit various valves. A twin-valve head will have two separate slots for either valve, while a ‘smart-head’ will automatically adjust to the various valve sizes. Then there’s the thread-on style, which offers a reliable fit, but needs to be ‘flipped and changed’ depending on your desired valve.</p>\n<p>If you use tubes or tubeless valves with a removable core, just be aware that some thread-on pump heads can unscrew the valve once inflated. For this style of valve, more common press-on style heads are best.</p>\n<p>If you run tubeless tyres, check out our list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-tubeless-pumps-and-inflators/\">best tubeless pumps and inflators</a>.</p>\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<p>If your pump is going to stay at home, size isn’t going to be of great concern. But if you’re planning to carry your pump on a ride or take it in the car, then it’s an important factor in your decision. The smallest mini-pumps will eventually inflate a tyre, but are obviously limited on air volume.</p>\n<h4>Weight</h4>\n<p>Much like size, weight isn’t a concern if the pump is going to be left at home, and here, a sturdy pump that doesn’t topple over is a bonus. But if you’re looking to carry it with you, then you don’t want anything too heavy.</p>\n<p>The most expensive pumps are now made with lightweight aluminium, but there are plenty of plastic options, which are perfectly acceptable too. Don’t trade low-weight for something that’s just not suited to your needs, but at the same time, there’s no point carrying extra weight if you don’t have to.</p>\n<h4>Construction</h4>\n<p>The quality of a pump’s construction is often in line with its price, and generally speaking the more expensive the pump, the more metal it contains.</p>\n<p>For track pumps, the cheapest options are plastic and will flex and wobble under heavy use, eventually giving up. The metal ones are far more solid, keep going and are well worth rebuilding.</p>\n<h4>Serviceability</h4>\n<p>Serviceability generally applies to the more expensive pumps, which can be seen as a long-term investment.</p>\n<p>Most main brands will offer a range of common spares to keep your pumps working. The most important spares are the head and valve gaskets because these will wear and begin to leak over time.</p>\n<p>Don’t buy an expensive pump if spares are not readily available.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"7a72817533c6675665e6d2c9ca72d1b032db93f147646aa76c78422629acd6c8","category":"Cycling"}
