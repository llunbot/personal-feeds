Mostly, it’s their decades-long commitment to the pressure-relieving relief “Love Channel.” To each their own, but a little space goes a long way, regardless of riding style, bike category, or gender. I do use a Brooks B17 on my touring and bikepacking bike, but only because I’ve found that multiple 10-hour days in a row can ruin a traditional saddle. So, all my “normal” mountain bikes have either standard WTB Volt, or a slightly more race-ready Volt Fusion Form.</p>\n<p>Fusion Form mostly refers to the saddle’s composite “base.” WTB can tune the ingredients in the raw material before the base is molded to achieve a stiffer or flexier structure. Apparently it also looks sleeker, but who cares. My eyes are up here. It’s a holistic approach to saddle design that they’ve expanded to other models. Most recently, the Rocket and the all-new Solano and Solano SL. So, let’s climb aboard.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>WTB Solano SL</h3>\n<p>Short-nosed saddles have been low-key trending over the past decade. Patient Zero is arguably the Specialized Power lineup. Some say short saddles remove pressure from the perineum simply by removing part of the saddle itself. Others say it encourages riders to sit further back on the saddle where they likely belong. I say it makes a bike with a more forward-leaning body position more comfortable, especially as a male. There’s still pressure, but there’s noticeably <i>less</i> pressure out front. The Solano SL is a pretty textbook example of this concept.</p>\n<h3>WTB Solano SL Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Medium (tested): 142 mm wide x 240 mm long (110 – 125 mm sit bones)</li>\n<li>Wide: 157 mm wide x 140 mm long (125 – 155 mm sit bones)</li>\n<li>Firm Fusion Form base</li>\n<li>Titanium rails: $119.95</li>\n<li>Carbon rails: $209.95</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is, it feels like a race saddle. Chamois highly recommended. Among the three saddles we’re talking about today, this one was the least my tempo. But I think that makes it a really important addition to the WTB lineup. They don’t have the sleek and speedy catalog of Selle Italia or Fizik. They have a wolf in their logo and “Wilderness Trail” in their name. The Solano SL is a departure from that.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-09.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-09.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-08.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-08.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’d choose this saddle if I regularly rubbed shoulders on a competitive Sunday Morning post-coffee gravel ride with a bunch of corpos who are way faster than me. It’s narrower along the nose than the Power or the Power clone made by Pro that I used to ride. So, it’s noticeably better in a standing sprint than them. It’s a very firm, all-business saddle with <i>just</i> enough width, rear ramp, and soul to still feel like a WTB</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-07.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-07.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>WTB Solano</h3>\n<p>Now we’re talking. If you’re <i>not</i> one of the aforementioned cafe-racing corpos, but you’re curious about the short-nose concept, the Solano is an excellent entry point. It’s got the same shape as the Solano SL, but an extra 4 mm of padding at the sitbones and 2 mm in the middle and nose. Holding it next to my more casual Volt Fusion Form, the softness is nearly identical. It’s just got a firmer Fusion Form base.</p>\n<h3>WTB Solano Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Medium (tested): 142 mm wide x 240 mm long (110 – 125 mm sit bones)</li>\n<li>Wide: 157 mm wide x 140 mm long (125 – 155 mm sit bones)</li>\n<li>4 mm extra padding over Solano SL at sitbones, 2 mm extra in middle and nose</li>\n<li>Firm Fusion Form base</li>\n<li>Chromoly rails: $95.95</li>\n<li>Titanium rails: $119.95</li>\n<li>Carbon rails: $209.95</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Solano is a practical evolution of the less-is-more approach to choosing a comfortable saddle. It’s got that short-nose freedom out over the ship’s bow, and an on-not-in sort of feel at the sit bones. I still find myself wanting a chamois for this saddle, but I’m soft like that. This is definitely not the hammock that some comfort-leaning saddles sometimes feel like. But it doesn’t immediately give the hot-spots that the Solano SL or other race-adjacent saddles give me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-06.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-06.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-05.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-05.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Like most short-nose saddles, it’s relatively wide, even in my size-medium test saddle. And of course, it’s got the WTB channel. It doesn’t quite suit any of the bikes I currently own, but when I finally replace my endurance road bike, this will be the first part I swap onto it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-04.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-04.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>WTB Rocket</h3>\n<p>I wish I had my old Rocket V to compare to the new one. Even in 2005, that saddle seemed pretty narrow. The new one is in a totally different category. It’s like how the Trek Top Fuel used to be their XC race bike. But now that’s the Supercaliber. Today’s Top Fuel is pretty much a trail bike. The Rocket’s new form is well served by the Fusion Form concept. It’s got a slightly softer base than the Solano and Solano SL. Plus, a more traditional long-nose shape. The length is almost identical to my Volt, and technically, it’s <i>wider</i> than the Volt, but it’s not that simple.</p>\n<h3>WTB Rocket Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>145 mm wide x 260 mm long(110 – 125 mm sit bones)</li>\n<li>Medium width only</li>\n<li>Soft Fusion Form base</li>\n<li>“Backstop” rear ramp</li>\n<li>Steel rails: $49.95</li>\n<li>Chromoly rails: $95.95</li>\n<li>Stainless rails: $109.95</li>\n<li>Titanium rails: $119.95</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sides of the Rocket start to arch downward just outside the sit bones. That gives it a hint of that racy convex feel, despite having a pretty pronounced channel. When sitting and coasting, the saddle feels narrow compared to my Volt Fusion Form. But while tensing up my glutes during forceful pedaling, I can feel support from those downward-sloping sides.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-03.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-03.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-02.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-02.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/wtb-saddle-review-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’d call it sort of a comfort race saddle. Or rather, a race comfort saddle. Like the standard Solano, the Rocket’s pad thickness is a bit above average for a performance saddle. But it also has the more flexible Fusion Form base. So, the chassis is aimed at comfort. It’s just shaped to almost give you the illusion that it’s narrower than it is. While the standard Volt and Volt Fusion Form are great for long, lazy days, the Rocket is great for long days when you want to cover a lot of miles.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/?srsltid=AfmBOory6aEwbKoJ9BfFwEmXcuIharnbnZBmEkYAkh_ThoMFY7MnYeJ2\" target=\"_blank\">WTB</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/first-ride-review-wtb-solano-sl-rocket-saddles/\">First Ride Review: Three New WTB Saddles – Solano, Solano SL, and Rocket</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"617eda83811ba781e15a8cdef7aae6017bf73d94ef3b0840e006845018da1536","category":"Cycling"}
