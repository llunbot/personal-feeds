These investigations are internal employment matters, and false accusations have the potential to needlessly wreck someone's career. As a result, most of these investigations are kept completely confidential, even after their completion.</p>\n<p>But all the details of a misconduct investigation performed by Harvard University became public this week through an unusual route. The professor who had been accused of misconduct, Francesca Gino, had filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit, targeting both Harvard and a team of external researchers who had accused her of misconduct. Harvard submitted its investigator's report as part of its attempt to have part of the suit dismissed, and the judge overseeing the case made it public.</p>\n<p>We covered one of the studies at issue at the time of its publication. It has since been retracted, and we'll be updating our original coverage accordingly.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010602#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010602&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"967ef29947e29be2aa5bbd6dcb55a20dbd3de33bbcc8e3982499449cfc24a332","category":"Tech"}
