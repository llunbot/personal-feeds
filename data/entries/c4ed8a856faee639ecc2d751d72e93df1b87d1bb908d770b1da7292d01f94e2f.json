{"title":"NPR on Trump’s Executive Order to Pause Enforcement of the TikTok Ban and Provide Supposed Immunity to Companies That Are Violating the Clear Letter of the Law","link":"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268701/trump-executive-order-tiktok-ban","date":1737479547000,"content":"\n<p>Bobby Allyn, reporting for NPR:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/application-of-protecting-americans-from-foreign-adversary-controlled-applications-act-to-tiktok/\">the order</a>, the law will be paused for 75 days and\ncompanies that work with TikTok will not be liable for doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I take issue with this framing. The order does not pause the law, because executive orders can’t “pause” laws. The order pauses enforcement of the law. The order itself even says so. Quoting from <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/application-of-protecting-americans-from-foreign-adversary-controlled-applications-act-to-tiktok/\">the order itself</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any\naction to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to\nallow my Administration an opportunity to determine the\nappropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects\nnational security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a\ncommunications platform used by millions of Americans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Back to Allyn at NPR:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Essentially with TikTok I have the right to sell it or close it,”\nTrump said from the Oval Office after signing the executive action\non Monday. “We may have to get approval from China. I’m not sure.\nI’m sure they’ll approve.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This man is an ignoramus.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/21/npr-trump-tiktok\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c4ed8a856faee639ecc2d751d72e93df1b87d1bb908d770b1da7292d01f94e2f","category":"Tech"}
