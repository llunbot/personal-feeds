Now we know why: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://x.com/applemusic/status/1730629199084282154?s=46&amp;t=KeNv190kZok_LLb57m5tjg&amp;xcust=1-1-2160329-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Music has announced</a> that Taylor Swift’s Eras: The Experience will take place in New York City on December 8-9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear exactly what the event will be, but we do know two things: Taylor Swift will not be there, and people can register to request tickets now. Apple notes that the registration window will be open through Saturday, December 3 at 11 am ET, and “only registrations from the Greater New York City era are eligible for selection.” Apple notes that early registration won’t affect your chances to get a ticket but the site was still slammed with more than 50,000 Swifties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement was done <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://x.com/taylornation13/status/1730624188845596690&amp;xcust=1-1-2160329-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">in collaboration with Taylor Nation</a>, Swift’s official fan club on X. An accompanying video featured celebrities such as Selena Gomez, Sabrina Carpenter, Camila Cabello, and Gracie Abrams talking about Swift over her “1989” track, “Welcome to New York.” Once you log in with your Ticketmaster account, it says the event will be held in Lower Manhattan over five timeslots:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Friday 12/8: 1 pm to 4 pm; 5pm to 7 pm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saturday 12/9: 10 am to 1pm; 2pm to 4pm; 5pm to 7 pm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The site says the start time will be <em>between</em> the times selected so more than one group will likely be admitted in each time slot. Ticketmaster says the event will let fans “interact with ten set pieces representative of Taylor’s ten distinct eras” and will take approximately 40 minutes. You can register for multiple time slots but will have to choose one if selected. Previous Apple Music artists of the year have conducted exclusive interviews and contributed personal playlists. In 2019, Billie Eilish performed an exclusive concert streamed on Apple Music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Yorkers can request tickers at the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://erasx6j3vxfdsn3u9ox3wzql.shop.ticketstoday.com/Splash.aspx&amp;xcust=1-1-2160329-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor Swift’s Eras: The Experience site</a> through tomorrow.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"749e58f02335989ebd4ae979374e6836575a6156315ec6d9518e1d855c8e1a35","category":"Apple"}
