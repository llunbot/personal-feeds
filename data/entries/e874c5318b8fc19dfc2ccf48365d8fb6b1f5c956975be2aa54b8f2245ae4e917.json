Software chief Craig Federighi is also believed to have taken on more responsibility to turn ‌Apple Intelligence‌ around.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe company has altered its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-abruptly-changes-marketing-materials/\">marketing strategy</a> away from the \"Hello, ‌Apple Intelligence‌\" tagline and the features are finally expected to launch sometime within the next year. With this recent context, we get John's thoughts on how the situation has evolved since he wrote his article, including on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-hit-with-more-siri-delay-lawsuits/\">proposed class-action lawsuits</a> against Apple over false advertising. We also look at how Apple may present its suite of AI features at WWDC later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMoreover, we reflect on the Vision Pro almost two years after its announcement, and John explains why he believes that the headset avoided the mismanagement that has mired apple Intelligence. We also talk through rumors about the second-generation Vision Pro headset that is expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/vision-pro-2-now-in-production/\">between fall 2025 and spring 2026</a> as a minor spec bump, simply upgrading from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> to the M5 chip. We also explore the highly anticipated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/\">lower-cost Vision headset</a>, dubbed \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/\">Vision Air</a>,\" and how this could be positioned when it launches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe look at the state of Apple's smart home proposition and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> amid rumors that the company's first smart home hub product has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/\">delayed to 2026</a>. The device is believed to be finished and was originally scheduled to launch in March 2025, but due to its reliance on ‌Apple Intelligence‌ its release has reportedly been shelved until next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinally, we discuss the long-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">foldable iPhone</a>, pondering on what Apple is likely to do differently when it launches the device <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">next year</a>. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> also has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.
