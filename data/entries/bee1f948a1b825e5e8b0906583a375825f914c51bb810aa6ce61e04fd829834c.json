Apple has made the controversial design decision to bring the iPhone notch to some of its laptops, minimizing bezel space but introducing an awkward cutout on the display area. Now, Samsung is apparently working on bringing the same idea to tablets. The reliable leaker, Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka \"<a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-renders-design-exclusive/\">OnLeaks,\"</a> has created renders of the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra design, and it basically looks like someone cut off the top half of a Macbook Pro, complete with that weird notch.</p>\n<p>According to OnLeak's information, the base-model S8 Tab is expected to be an 11-inch tablet, a \"Galaxy Tab S8+\" will be 12.4 inches, and this notched behemoth, the Tab S8 Ultra, will have a 14.6-inch display. The renders only cover the Ultra model. The base-model S8 design leaked in a <a href=\"https://zouton.com/news/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-11-inch-2022-leak-designs-renders-specifications-price-exclusive\">separate post</a>, showing a more traditional design with slightly thicker bezels housing a camera module. The Ultra model features dual rear cameras, a USB-C port, quad speakers, and no headphone jack.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/52.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/52-980x735.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/52.jpg\">Those are some thin bezels. I'm not sure where you're supposed to hold this thing. </a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-renders-design-exclusive/\">OnLeaks x 91mobile </a>)</p></div>\n<p>As usual, Hemmerstoffer's information is based on CAD files covering the location of everything (including this crazy notch), but some of the finer details could be different. This report notes that there will be magnetic connectors on the left side of the frame, but it's not clear what those will look like.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807175#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807175&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bee1f948a1b825e5e8b0906583a375825f914c51bb810aa6ce61e04fd829834c","category":"Tech"}
