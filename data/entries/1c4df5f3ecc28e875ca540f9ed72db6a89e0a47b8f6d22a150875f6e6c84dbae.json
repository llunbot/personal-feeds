The changes are subtle – extending the seatstays further up &amp; forward into the main triangle, and moving the linkage forward to drive the shock directly from the end of the stays (rather than a secondary yoke). That should save a bit of weight actually, but paired with slightly longer chainstays, it also allows Wilier to claw back a bit of extra tire clearance – now up to 29 x 2.4″ with a full 5mm of mud clearance all around.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Wilier Urta Max SLR lightweight 120mm carbon XC race mountain bike, shock detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Wilier-Urta-Max-SLR-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-race-mountain-bike_link-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Cory Benson</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The seatstays also get a slight new kink just in front of the rear axle, presumably to better tune where the pivot-less seatstays would flex.
