Both riders are taking part in the Tour de Wallonie, where Groenewegen now leads after winning stage 1.</p><p>“It is a great relief that it is now working again,” Groenewegen said after the stage. “A lot has happened in my private life, but we’ve worked hard and it’s nice that it’s now working. It was a very difficult time. Of course with the accident, but also privately with the birth of my son. Fortunately that’s going well now. Also the death of my grandfather, that is never fun. To win again is very nice.”</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3ed60135495db2c98e3965d6040b46b1f16f015c71d12e51aeb668e0d3a402ad","category":"Cycling"}
