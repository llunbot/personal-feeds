Vast open spaces dotted with interesting geographical features, dirt tracks as far as the eye can see, and a history and culture that runs incredibly deep all contribute to making this east Asian country a dynamic experience. Sandwiched between Russia and China though, Mongolia can be tricky to access and, as a result, it often seemed to get pushed down the list of places for Ryan to visit, but when he finally had a chance to spend a summer there, he jumped on it…<span></span></em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"404\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-02.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"413\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-03.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>With a landmass about 1/6th of the size of the US and a population that is 1/100th the size, you start to get an idea of just how vast and empty the country is. Then, when you realize that nearly half of Mongolia’s population lives in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, it really puts everything into perspective. When you leave the city, it gets wild in a hurry. Even on a simple 20km test loop out of the country’s largest population center, I was greeted by horses roaming free and endlessly rolling grassy hills dotted by “gers” (aka yurts).</p>\n<p>I planned to head out to the Altai Mountains in the far western reaches of the country to make a big loop near the border with China and then ride my way back toward Ulaanbaatar (aka UB) over the next two months. First, that would require cramming my bike and body into a small cross-country bus for nearly 30 hours (with bus mechanicals along the way), while an older Mongolian man used my shoulder as a pillow, eventually reaching my ride’s starting point in the town of the Khovd.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-15.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>This region immediately had a distinctly different feel from the green grassy hills and forests that surround UB. Here the steppe was arid and the rolling terrain was replaced with rugged peaks.</p>\n<p>After a couple of days in Khovd to clear out the cobwebs in my legs from being crammed in the bus for days, I was loaded up and ready to hit the road out of town. I was, of course, immediately greeted by a notorious Mongolian crosswind as I headed south on one of the few big, paved roads in the country. It was certainly a sign of things to come!</p>\n<p>There isn’t a whole lot of info or previously established bike routes throughout Mongolia, so I mostly relied on some local paper maps that I found at a bookstore back in the big city along with satellite images and some good old-fashioned local advice. My first destination would be through a long valley to the small village of “Mönkhkhairkhan”. I’ve certainly made a fool of myself trying to pronounce the names of various places around the world to locals, but this one might take the cake.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-16.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>After a quick blast down the main asphalt highway, I turned down what was just a series of vague tire tracks in the dirt that were aimed for the mountains where I was able to find my first campsite of the trip. The hype is true, that Mongolia is essentially one giant idyllic wild campsite after another, and the first one did not disappoint. After so much time in places like Colombia and Nepal in recent days where it can be extremely tricky to find places to pitch the tent, this was the aspect of Mongolia that I was most looking forward to.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-20.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>In the morning I set out to try to find the “road” I was supposed to be on, though this can be tricky at times in the wide open valleys of Mongolia, as tracks tend to veer off in virtually every direction, or sometimes with a few dozen tracks all heading one way in parallel. You jump on one set of tracks and then notice it’s starting to steer you a few degrees off course and you stare at your GPS wondering if you messed up somewhere along the way.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-34.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"332\" height=\"221\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-31.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"329\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-32.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>As I neared the entrance of the narrow part of the valley, I found myself on the correct track heading up the gradual climb alongside a flowing river. While I’d already had to ford the river once in a wider section further down the road, I’d been concerned about the prospects of having to cross it as it became narrower, deeper, and with a lot more force behind it as I continued up the valley. Thankfully, these concerns were put to rest when a man on a motorcycle coming the other direction confirmed to me through various hand motions (given the language barrier) that there was indeed a bridge to cross the river up ahead.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"413\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?resize=1800,2250&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-27.jpg?resize=1638,2048&amp;quality=75 1638w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"423\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?resize=1800,2250&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/RyanWilson_BikepackingAltaiMongolia-38.jpg?resize=1638,2048&amp;quality=75 1638w\" /></p>\n<p>After a windy night camped next to the river I rode a couple of hours into Mönkhkhairkhan where some locals were cooking up Khuushuur, which are basically like Mongolia empanadas filled with sheep meat, and a man speaking English offered up a couch to crash on for the night while I stocked up on supplies and even had a steaming hot shower at the local public bathhouse.
