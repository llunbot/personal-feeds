Among the newer strategies employed by \"bowlers\"—the equivalent of the pitcher in baseball—is delivering the ball with the arm horizontally positioned close to the shoulder line, which has proven remarkably effective in \"tricking\" batsmen in their perception of the ball's trajectory.</p>\n<p>Scientists at Amity University Dubai in the United Arab Emirates were curious about the effectiveness of the approach, so they tested the aerodynamics of cricket balls in wind tunnel experiments. The team concluded that this style of bowling creates a high-speed spinning effect that shifts the ball's trajectory mid-flight—an effect also seen in certain baseball pitches, according to a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0215749\">new paper</a> published in the journal Physics of Fluids.</p>\n<p>“The unique and unorthodox bowling styles demonstrated by cricketers have drawn significant attention, particularly emphasizing their proficiency with a new ball in early stages of a match,” <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1054079\">said co-author Kizhakkelan Sudhakaran Siddharth,</a> a mechanical engineer at Amity University Dubai. “Their bowling techniques frequently deceive batsmen, rendering these bowlers effective throughout all phases of a match in almost all formats of the game.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042516#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042516&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c1c04e9fc9b251ff86878b641bd7b1a09c7be9411e1755bf9e3de640f48d4939","category":"Tech"}
