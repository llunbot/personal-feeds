This is evident in its wheel development, rim tape, valves, tires, and now its own <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/pages/tcstiresealant\" target=\"_blank\">Tubeless Tire Sealant</a>. It only makes sense that the brand would want to encapsulate its products under the TCS System umbrella. Now, not all sealant is created equal, and while everyone has their favorite sealant to use but WTB is doing something unique with its sealant so let’s check out what details make it different…<span></span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I would have attempted to demonstrate this myself but good tires are hard to come by these days!</em></p>\n<p>Probably the most outstanding claim is that due to the particles in the compound, this sealant can repair 6mm punctures on its own without the use of a tire plug. While this isn’t going to be as robust as the tire itself, it will be a long-lasting fix, allowing you to get back to your shop to patch the tire. You could also use a tire plug to make that hole smaller, making for a more suitable trailside repair. I recommend <a href=\"http://www.dynaplug.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dynaplug</a>‘s products for that!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/WTBSealant-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Now one main difference between this sealant and its competitors’ offerings is the TCS Tubeless Tire Sealant uses an ammonia-free solution made from synthetic latex and hardens in a tackifying process. Whereas many competitors’ sealants use ammonia-based latex that hardens based on an evaporative effect. This works great unless the trail conditions are wet and the sealant isn’t allowed to congeal due to the ambient humidity altering the evaporative process. Another bonus of using synthetic latex is that it will reduce the risk of an allergic reaction for individuals with allergies to natural latex products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/WTBSealant-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The one bummer, as it’s pointed out on the rear label, is the sealant is optimized for temps above 40º and isn’t designed to function below 15º. Rather than adding anti-freeze to this latex soup, WTB opted for more fibrous material to help seal your punctures faster. This new sealant is available in 4oz, 8oz, 16oz, and 32oz bottles from your local dealer.
