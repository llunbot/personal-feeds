They say that code name <a href=\"https://thesis.bike/pages/n1-signup\">Project N+1</a>, will do “everything in-between” as well. Could it be the last drop bar bike you’ll ever need? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With classic road aesthetics, generous tire clearance, and extensive component compatibility, it looks like a thoughtful design to me.

The components and fit are similar, but the differences in fit and positioning, handling, and tire clearance meant choosing a bike for the different terrains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing between “<em>a blended all-road bike, a partially-adjustable bike that compromises some geometry for others, or an entire stable of single-purpose bikes. This is part of what gave rise to the belief that the optimal number of bicycles is always one more than you currently have – N+1</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What if One Bike Could Be Many</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>That was the inspiration behind “Project N1”, the code-name for Thesis’ effort to create the first bicycle that adapts quickly and completely from road to gravel and everything in between</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version.jpeg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 road version\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-road-version-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Dropouts are slid down and forward for “Road” mode…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rotate, Stretch, Drop</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-drop-out-close-up-e1715186030706.jpeg\"><img width=\"851\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-drop-out-close-up-e1715186030706.jpeg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 rear drop out close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-drop-out-close-up-e1715186030706.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-drop-out-close-up-e1715186030706-297x275.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-drop-out-close-up-e1715186030706-120x111.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-drop-out-close-up-e1715186030706-768x710.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thesis’ Project N1 prototype can switch from gravel geometry to road in just a matter of minutes with nothing more than a hex wrench.

The fork is currently still under development. Flipping the chip will move the axle 10mm away from the caliper, extending the fork’s axle-to-crown measurement, and further slackening the head angle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-front-fork.jpeg\"><img width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-front-fork.jpeg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 front fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-front-fork.jpeg 853w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-front-fork-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-front-fork-80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-front-fork-768x1152.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it allows the fork offset to be corrected and the front center to be increased. What about the 10mm discrepancy at the caliper? Thesis suggests utilizing a 160mm rotor on the road wheelset and a 180mm on the gravel wheelset. This will eliminate the need to move the caliper when flipping the chip and swapping stuff over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thesis Head of Brand, Sam Jackson had this to say:</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Figuring out how to make the swap between modes simple and approachable for novice riders with limited mechanical knowledge was essential to the success of the design. We’re happy to say that it’s incredibly easy to switch the bike between gravel and road setups; going from end to end on the rear sliders completely transforms the bike without any need to tinker with the brake caliper. This is truly a do it all bike that people will be able to swap between a road and gravel bike as frequently as they want to, enabling an immense amount of latitude within one bike. The idea was to vary the handling from Land Cruiser to Lamborghini, and without a doubt it delivers.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Flippin’ Difference</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-geo-highlights.jpg\"><img width=\"562\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-geo-highlights.jpg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 geo highlights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-geo-highlights.jpg 562w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-geo-highlights-297x236.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-geo-highlights-120x95.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-pump-peg-nice-welds.jpeg\"><img width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-pump-peg-nice-welds.jpeg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 pump peg nice welds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-pump-peg-nice-welds.jpeg 853w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-pump-peg-nice-welds-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-pump-peg-nice-welds-80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-pump-peg-nice-welds-768x1152.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-headtube.jpeg\"><img width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-headtube.jpeg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 headtube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-headtube.jpeg 853w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-headtube-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-headtube-80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-headtube-768x1152.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Project N+1 Frame Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Threaded T47 68mm BB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Straight 44mm head tube</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Round 27.2 seatpost secured by a traditional collar</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Future-proof UDH &amp; Transmission-compatible dropout system</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Micro-adjustment screws the rear dropouts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compatibility with 1x/2x mechanical &amp; electronic, internally-geared hub, &amp; single-speed drivetrains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support for fenders, racks, dynamos, wired lights, droppers as well as</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Partial-internal, full-internal, &amp; full-external (fork-only) routing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-Down-tube-logo-better-e1715186144635.jpeg\"><img width=\"851\" height=\"938\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-Down-tube-logo-better-e1715186144635.jpeg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 Down tube logo better\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-Down-tube-logo-better-e1715186144635.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-Down-tube-logo-better-e1715186144635-272x300.jpeg 272w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-Down-tube-logo-better-e1715186144635-109x120.jpeg 109w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-Down-tube-logo-better-e1715186144635-768x847.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-end-e1715186128469.jpeg\"><img width=\"851\" height=\"866\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-end-e1715186128469.jpeg\" alt=\"Thesis Bike Project N1 rear end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-end-e1715186128469.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-end-e1715186128469-295x300.jpeg 295w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-end-e1715186128469-118x120.jpeg 118w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thesis-Bike-Project-N1-rear-end-e1715186128469-768x782.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing for the Thesis Project N+1 has yet to be announced.
