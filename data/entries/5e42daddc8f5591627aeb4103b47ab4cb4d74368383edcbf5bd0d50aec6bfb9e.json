And we’ve found one: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DLHN9WYG/\">Amazon is selling the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air M3 with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,400</a>, a savings of $299 on its original $1,699 MSRP. That’s an amazing price point for this high-performance laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">we reviewed the M3 MacBook Air</a>, we declared it was simply the best, finding that the chip upgrade made serious improvements to the laptop’s overall performance. Of course, nowadays, we have the new M4 MacBook Air to love and cherish, but we still love the M3 models. Just note, while the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD8V9HW/\">new Air version with the same 24GB memory sells for $1,599</a>, $100 less than the M3, it’s unlikely that we’ll see any significant discounts for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for now, the M3 MacBook Air with 24GB memory is the best value you can get in an Apple laptop. The laptop’s 15.4-inch Liquid Retina Display is absolutely gorgeous and will deliver crystal-clear images no matter what you have to do. From streaming Netflix to handling productivity tools to writing, you’ll love the quality. With 512GB of storage space, you should have plenty of space for all your files, apps, and whatever else you want to store on your laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also super handy, when you leave the house, the 18-hour battery life will make it possible to leave the charger at home without worrying that your laptop will shut down before you’re done for the day. It’s also super light at just 3.3 pounds and less than an inch thick, which makes it easy to carry anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and take advantage of this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DLHN9WYG/\">amazing M3 MacBook Air deal</a> over at Amazon before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $300 on the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DLHN9WYG/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5e42daddc8f5591627aeb4103b47ab4cb4d74368383edcbf5bd0d50aec6bfb9e","category":"Apple"}
