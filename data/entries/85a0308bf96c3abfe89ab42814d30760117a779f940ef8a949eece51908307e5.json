{"title":"The new Orbea Terra could be the most customisable gravel bike you can buy","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-orbea-terra-launch/","date":1636642841000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/Orbea-Terra-2022-1-93ec10c.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>The Orbea Terra has been redesigned for 2022 and now boasts bigger tyre clearances, nimbler handling characteristics and an adaptable design. Orbea says that to best serve the wide-ranging remit of gravel, the Terra can be easily modified to suit a variety of riders’ needs and budgets.</p>\n<p>As such, barring some special headset spacers, the new Terra is as non-proprietary as things get. It’s compatible with 1x and 2x electronic and mechanical groupsets; with both 700c wheels (with 45mm clearance) and 650b wheels (with 50mm clearance); fits conventional bars, stems and seatposts; and offers mounting points galore for bottle cages and mudguard/fender mounts.</p>\n<p>The bike is offered as seven models in six sizes, ranging in price from £2,899 / €2,899 / $3,199 to £4,999 / €4,999 / $5,299.</p>\n<p>Using Orbea’s MyO custom bike builder tool, however (an option Orbea offers at no extra cost), the spec and even paint scheme can be tweaked further to suit individual needs to a much greater extent than many other bike brands offer.</p>\n<p>The carbon-framed Terra will be available to buy later in November, but there will also be an aluminium version of the Terra available in the near future that Orbea says will achieve more accessible price points. The aluminium Terra will also have rear-rack compatibility.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Orbea Terra 2022: 10 things you need to know</h2>\n<ul><li>45mm 700c tyre clearance, 50mm for 650b tyres</li>\n<li>Asymmetric chainstays accommodate a range of drivetrains</li>\n<li>Handling has been quickened up </li>\n<li>Compliance has been built into seat tube and fork</li>\n<li>Multiple cage/bag mounting points and fender/mudguard mounts</li>\n<li>Very customisable: fits most standard components</li>\n<li>Seven models across six frame sizes, from XS to XXL</li>\n<li>Spec and paint can be changed using Orbea’s MyO program</li>\n<li>Prices range from £2,899 / €2,899 / $3,199 to £4,999 / €4,999 / $5,299</li>\n<li>Carbon bike available in late autumn, aluminium version coming soon</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>The new Terra makes up ground</h2>\n<p>Orbea launched the first Terra back in 2017, having started to develop it in 2015.</p>\n<p>“We recognised the gravel trend had potential, but didn’t really know how it was going to evolve,” says Orbea’s product manager, Joseba Arizaga.</p>\n<p>It meant the brand was early into the discipline, but it entered somewhat conservatively.</p>\n<p>In geometry terms, the first Terra wasn’t too far removed from an endurance road bike, offering a similar high and short ride position, but with a more relaxed head-tube angle and moderate 40mm 700c tyre clearance.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All change for Orbea’s new Terra.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>With the new Terra, Orbea has taken a much more modern and committed design approach. Orbea says the new bike has more reactive handling, yet should be more stable too.</p>\n<p>The brand says this has been achieved by lengthening the reach of the bike (the distance from the bottom bracket to the top of the head tube) and dropping the bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>Changes like these usually calm the handling of a bike but, to counteract this, Orbea has steepened the head-tube angle and specced shorter stems as standard. It’s a recipe that’s proving popular in modern gravel bike design.</p>\n<p>The new Terra’s tyre clearance is much more contemporary too. Orbea claims tyre clearance has been bumped up to 45mm for 700c wheels and 50mm clearance can be achieved on 650b wheels. That’s despite shortening the chainstays to 420mm.</p>\n<p>Orbea says it was able to tuck the chainstays in that much – which helps the new Terra’s lively handling characteristics – but still offer so much tyre clearance by dropping the driveside chainstay.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Terra drops the driveside chainstay to offer big tyre clearance but keep the back end tight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>This was a feature pioneered on gravel bikes with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/fit-and-trim-the-open-up-gets-a-refresh-for-2018/\">OpenUP</a>, but has since been widely adopted as it very effectively solves the space conundrum of fitting chunky gravel tyres between chainstays constrained within a narrow road Q-factor (the distance between the cranks).</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th></th><th>XS</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th><th>XXL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Seat tube (mm)</b></td><td>405</td><td>438</td><td>471</td><td>504</td><td>537</td><td>570</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube (mm)</b></td><td>526</td><td>539</td><td>558</td><td>570</td><td>590</td><td>603</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube (mm)</b></td><td>110</td><td>131</td><td>152</td><td>178</td><td>199</td><td>220</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay (mm)</b></td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>BB height (mm)</b></td><td>278</td><td>278</td><td>278</td><td>280</td><td>280</td><td>280</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>BB drop (mm)</b></td><td>78</td><td>78</td><td>78</td><td>76</td><td>76</td><td>76</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase (mm)</b></td><td>1009</td><td>1019</td><td>1029</td><td>1044</td><td>105</td><td>1062</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head angle (degrees)</b></td><td>70</td><td>70.5</td><td>71</td><td>71</td><td>71.5</td><td>72</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat angle (degrees)</b></td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73</td><td>73</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Standover (mm)</b></td><td>727</td><td>755</td><td>783</td><td>813</td><td>840</td><td>868</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach (mm)</b></td><td>375</td><td>382</td><td>389</td><td>395</td><td>402</td><td>409</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack (mm)</b></td><td>526</td><td>548</td><td>570</td><td>592</td><td>614</td><td>636</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Fork length (mm)</b></td><td>390</td><td>390</td><td>390</td><td>390</td><td>390</td><td>390</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Considered comfort</h2>\n<p>While much of the comfort in a gravel bike can be created by the tyres, Orbea claims it found it could build a little compliance into the Terra’s frame without sacrificing any stiffness or weight.</p>\n<p>The front triangle has been made compact to shorten the seat tube and expose more of the 27.2mm seatpost, helping it to flex. Orbea also says the material at the base of the seat tube, where it joins the bottom-bracket junction, “has been adjusted to provide just the right amount of rigidity”, adding rear-end compliance.</p>\n<p>Orbea says the Terra also has a longer fork – the increased length should make it better able to dissipate vibration – plus the distinctive kink forward at the fork crown apparently helps it to absorb impacts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The fork is distinctive in both form and function.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<h2>Going the extra mile</h2>\n<p>Orbea has nicely complemented the Terra’s general capability with some neat extra touches.</p>\n<p>Echoing a feature adopted by brands such as Trek in its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-trek-checkpoint/\">Checkpoint</a> gravel bike and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/trek-domane-sl6-review/\">Domane</a> endurance bike, the Terra has a storage space in the down tube, accessed via a hatch underneath the down tube bottle cage mount.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A smaller version of the one you had at school, but on your bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>Orbea dubs it ‘Lockr’ and says it’s voluminous enough to pack in a spare tube, pump, CO2 cartridge and multitool, which would probably otherwise have to go in a saddlebag or jersey pockets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/internal-cable-routing-has-gone-too-far/\">Somewhat controversially</a> for a bike purporting to be versatile and simple, the Terra uses Orbea’s ICR internal cable routing system to tuck cables away at the front end.</p>\n<p>The ICR system (found on several of Orbea’s other bikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/orbea-orca-omr-m20i-team-review/\">Orca OMR</a> and new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-orbea-orca-aero/\">Orca Aero</a>) guides cables along the underside of the stem and down the front of the steerer tube using shaped, extended headset spacers. These feed into a headset with a larger-diameter 1 1/2in upper bearing.</p>\n<p>As the steerer is a smaller 1 1/8in in size, there is space for the cables to slide into the frame alongside the fork steerer.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cables are hidden to ease the attachment of bar bags.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>This solution means changing the upper headset bearing will be tricky, but Orbea reasons that because it’ll be such an infrequent job it’s worth the trade-off, as it results in a clean front end that’s much easier to attach bar bags to.</p>\n<h2>Orbea Terra specs and prices</h2>\n<p>The new Terra will be available in seven models, although the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Campagnolo Ekar</a> build will only be available in the US.</p>\n<p>The available builds add credence to Orbea’s claims that the Terra works in any guise, with electronic and mechanical, 1x and 2x options all available in the range. The bikes all come with 700c wheels though, so any riders wanting the extra grip and comfort of 650b tyres will need to buy an extra set of wheels and tyres separately.</p>\n<p>Courtesy of Orbea’s MyO program, many of the spec choices on each build can be changed during the purchase process, but to keep things simple only the standard specs are detailed below.</p>\n<h3>Terra M30 Team 1x</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 1x gearing at the new Terra’s most accessible price point.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Frameset: Terra OMR</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX600 1x</li>\n<li>Handlebar: OC1 All-road</li>\n<li>Stem: OC1</li>\n<li>Seatpost: OC2 Carbon</li>\n<li>Saddle: Prologo Akero AGX STN</li>\n<li>Wheels: Orbea Ready GR</li>\n<li>Tyres: Vittoria Terreno Dry CX-Gravel TNT G2.0 38mm</li>\n<li>Price: £2,899 / €2,899 / $3,199</li>\n</ul><h3>Terra M30 Team</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea Terra M30 Team.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Frameset: Terra OMR</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX600</li>\n<li>Handlebar: OC1 All-road</li>\n<li>Stem: OC1</li>\n<li>Seatpost: OC2 Carbon</li>\n<li>Saddle: Prologo Akero AGX STN</li>\n<li>Wheels: Orbea Ready GR</li>\n<li>Tyres: Vittoria Terreno Dry CX-Gravel TNT G2.0 38mm</li>\n<li>Price: £2,999 / €2,999 / $3,299</li>\n</ul><h3>Terra M20 Team</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea Terra M20 Team.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Frameset: Terra OMR</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX810</li>\n<li>Handlebar: OC1 All-road</li>\n<li>Stem: OC1</li>\n<li>Seatpost: OC2 Carbon</li>\n<li>Saddle: Prologo Akero AGX STN</li>\n<li>Wheels: Orbea Ready GR</li>\n<li>Tyres: Vittoria Terreno Dry CX-Gravel TNT G2.0 38mm</li>\n<li>Price: £3,399 / €3,399 / $3,699</li>\n</ul><h3>Terra M31e Team 1x</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea Terra M31e Team 1X with Sram’s Rival eTap AXS XPLR.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Frameset: Terra OMR</li>\n<li>Groupset: Sram Rival eTap AXS XPLR</li>\n<li>Handlebar: OC1 All-road</li>\n<li>Stem: ICR</li>\n<li>Seatpost: OC2 Carbon</li>\n<li>Saddle: Prologo Akero AGX STN</li>\n<li>Wheels: Fulcrum Rapid Red 900 DB</li>\n<li>Tyres: Vittoria Terreno Dry CX-Gravel TNT G2.0 38mm</li>\n<li>Price: £3,799 / €3,799 / $4,199</li>\n</ul><h3>Terra M20i Team</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea Terra M20i Team.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Frameset: Terra OMR</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX815</li>\n<li>Handlebar: OC1 All-road</li>\n<li>Stem: ICR</li>\n<li>Seatpost: OC2 Carbon</li>\n<li>Saddle: Prologo Akero AGX STN</li>\n<li>Wheels: Fulcrum Rapid Red 900 DB</li>\n<li>Tyres: Pirelli Cinturato Gravel H TLR 40mm</li>\n<li>Price: £4,599 / €4,599 / $4,999</li>\n</ul><h3>Terra M20e Team 1x</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea Terra M20e Team 1X.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Frameset: Terra OMR</li>\n<li>Groupset: Sram Force eTap AXS XPLR</li>\n<li>Handlebar: OC1 All-road</li>\n<li>Stem: ICR</li>\n<li>Seatpost: OC2 Carbon</li>\n<li>Saddle: Prologo Akero AGX STN</li>\n<li>Wheels: Fulcrum Rapid Red 500 DB</li>\n<li>Tyres: Pirelli Cinturato Gravel H TLR 40mm</li>\n<li>Price: £4,999 / €4,999 / $5,299</li>\n</ul>","author":"Sam Challis","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"85a0308bf96c3abfe89ab42814d30760117a779f940ef8a949eece51908307e5","category":"Cycling"}
