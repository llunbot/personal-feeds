Multiple AirPods and Beats models are getting firmware updates, along with, oddly enough, the official Apple MagSafe charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of products and their new firmware numbers are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AirPods 2nd-gen: 5E135</li><li>AirPods 3rd-gen: 5E135</li><li>AirPods Pro 1st-gen: 5E135</li><li>AirPods Pro 2nd-gen: 5E135</li><li>AirPods Max: 5E135</li><li>PowerBeats Pro: 5B66</li><li>Beats Fit Pro: 5B66</li><li>MagSafe Charger: 258.0.0.0</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What do these firmware updates do? Nobody really knows! Apple never says. The company maintains a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213317&amp;xcust=1-1-1806017-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">support document for AirPods firmware updates</a> but every update only says it provides “Bug fixes and other improvements,” with very few exceptions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s worse, it’s not possible to actually update the firmware yourself. Firmware updates are delivered when your AirPods are charging and within range of a paired iPhone, iPad, or Mac that is connected to the Wi-Fi. Sometimes it happens quickly, sometimes it takes days, and there’s no way to force it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check the firmware version of your AirPods or Beats products, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Bluetooth</em>, then tap the Info button (i) next to the name of your AirPods. Scroll down to the <em>About</em> section to find the firmware version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check the firmware of your MagSafe charger, have it plugged into a power supply and attached to your iPhone. Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em> &gt; <em>Apple MagSafe Charger</em> and look for the firmware version. The MagSafe charger updates its firmware when connected to a power adapter and an iPhone that is connected to Wi-Fi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firmware updates for AirPods are not uncommon, and it would probably behoove Apple to provide for a way to force them–even if just by long-pressing the firmware revision number in Settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7b44a21d7e0cf17cbd3ef2b6b46d4aaca364eea4f4e4025776841f3a1278dc26","category":"Apple"}
