Now, after developing electric vehicles based on its own gas-powered models, a cheaper VW platform, and a tweaked Taycan, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/throw-out-all-those-black-boxes-and-say-hello-to-the-software-defined-car/\">the brand has led the development</a> of a new platform just for electric vehicles, one that incorporates lessons learned from those earlier EVs.</p>\n<p>We've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/audi-is-planning-20-all-electric-models-by-2025-heres-how-it-will-do-it/\">followed the development</a> of that Premium Platform Electric architecture and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/audi-debuts-its-next-ev-platform-with-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/\">the Q6 e-tron</a> for some time. Now, we've finally been behind the wheel.</p>\n<p>Audi made its name with \"quattro\" all-wheel drive powertrains, and both versions of Q6 e-tron to be offered initially will use twin-motor, all-wheel drive powertrains—an asynchronous motor driving the front wheels and a permanent magnet synchronous motor at the rear. Both versions will use the same capacity 100 kWh (94.4 kWh net) battery pack, which operates at 800 V and DC fast-charges from 10–80 percent in 21 minutes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034780#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034780&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
