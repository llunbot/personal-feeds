As <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dh5hzm/ios_18_db_1_nap_detection/\">shared on Reddit</a>, an Apple Watch owner took a nap and was able to see the sleep data recorded in the Health app, despite not putting the device in Sleep Mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchOS-11-Thumb-2-1.jpg\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" />\r<br />\nRight now, the Apple Watch only tracks and records sleep when it is in Sleep Mode, and there is no support for tracking naps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe change should allow an Apple Watch running ‌watchOS 11‌ to record and include a nap in the Sleep section of the Health app, and it may also support automatic sleep tracking even when Sleep Mode isn't activated. Nap tracking has long felt like a missing feature from the Apple Watch, and this will be a welcome feature for those who supplement sleep with naps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-watch-nap-tracking-watchos-11.jpg\" width=\"1290\" height=\"1503\" /><em><div>Image via Reddit</div></em>\r<br />\nApple did not mention a change to the Sleep app in its preview information for ‌watchOS 11‌, and the only mention of sleep is related to the new Vitals app, which collects data for your health metrics during sleep in order to populate a typical range feature.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/watchos-11-supports-automatic-nap-detection/\">watchOS 11 Supports Automatic Nap Detection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-supports-automatic-nap-detection.2429472/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1564182e212a5fd46c39ee114fb6ec55607c44687c10a88690fe729644ac041d","category":"Apple"}
