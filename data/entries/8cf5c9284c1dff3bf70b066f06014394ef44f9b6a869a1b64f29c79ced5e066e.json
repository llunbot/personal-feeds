Microsoft believes its laptops will offer \"faster app emulation\" than Apple's Rosetta 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced in October, the Snapdragon X Elite has Arm-based architecture like Apple silicon. Qualcomm last year claimed that the processor achieved <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-faster-apple/\">21% faster multi-core CPU performance than the M3 chip</a>, based on the Geekbench 6 benchmark tool.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a few caveats here, including that Microsoft and Qualcomm are comparing to Apple's lower-end M3 chip instead of its higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. MacBooks with Apple silicon also offer industry-leading performance-per-watt, while the Snapdragon X Elite will likely run hotter and require laptops with fans. Since being updated with the M1 chip in 2020, the MacBook Air has featured a fanless design. Apple can also optimize the performance of MacBooks since it controls both the hardware and macOS software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNevertheless, it is clear that Apple's competitors are making progress with Arm-based laptops. Microsoft plans to announce laptops powered by the Snapdragon X Elite later this year, including the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 on May 20.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/microsoft-vs-m3-macbook-air/\">Microsoft Says Windows Laptops With Snapdragon X Elite Will Be Faster Than M3 MacBook Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-says-windows-laptops-with-snapdragon-x-elite-will-be-faster-than-m3-macbook-air.2423784/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8cf5c9284c1dff3bf70b066f06014394ef44f9b6a869a1b64f29c79ced5e066e","category":"Apple"}
