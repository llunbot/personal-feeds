In the aftermath of these deadly storms, video has emerged showing one of the tornadoes striking a power station, which appears to disrupt the circulation of the twister.</p>\n<p>This has led to rampant online speculation—as tends to happen in 2023—about whether it’s possible to “blow up” a tornado. Take a gander at the video below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tennessee tornado 2023. Please be safe.</p>\n<p>Friend from my wrestling academy captured this insane video in Madison. Please be safe. <a href=\"https://t.co/2JDWNznfUn\">pic.twitter.com/2JDWNznfUn</a></p>\n<p>— BD (@BrandonDavisBD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandonDavisBD/status/1733623315304955953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>This tornado occurred between Madison and Goodlettsville, just north of Nashville, east of I-65. What you see is the tornado striking a power substation, followed by an explosion. The power substation belonged to Nashville Electric Service, which subsequently released a video from the substation on Monday showing the strike and explosion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991064#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991064&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"36f8a4737e448c4a07026e25743fa38bb5f037adad6dfcd9d1686e57d1e60bd3","category":"Tech"}
