The leaks began with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/\">unboxing videos</a> shared by several Russian YouTube channels, showcasing the new entry-level MacBook Pro ahead of its official announcement. These leaks were followed by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/leaked-m4-macbook-pro-russian-classified-ad/\">listing</a> on a Russian classifieds site, where multiple units were allegedly being sold after what appears to be theft from a warehouse. This marks <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/\">one of Apple's most significant leaks</a> in recent memory, drawing comparisons to the 2010 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 4 prototype incident. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaked MacBook Pro reveals several notable upgrades. The M4 chip with a 10-core CPU is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-chip-benchmarks/\">25% faster</a> than the M3's 8-core CPU. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/\">As rumored</a>, it also comes with 16GB of RAM as the new base configuration, doubling the previous standard of 8GB, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/macbook-pro-m4-two-external-displays/\">support for up to two external displays</a> with the lid open. Another key improvement is the addition of a third Thunderbolt port, bringing the entry-level model up to parity with the higher-end configurations. It also looks like the entry-level MacBook Pro will be available in the Space Black color option for the first time. Despite these upgrades, the display, general design, and other features remain unchanged from the current MacBook Pro. These revelations come just weeks before Apple is expected to officially unveil its first M4-powered Macs, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/\">rumored release date</a> of November 1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/apple-release-schedule-changes/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple appears to be slowly moving away from its traditional annual release schedule for hardware and software, favoring a more staggered approach. This shift is evident with the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, where key features like Apple Intelligence are delayed and due to be rolled out in subsequent updates throughout 2025. As Apple's product lineup grows more complex, this strategy would allow for better quality control and innovation by releasing products and features when they are fully developed, rather than adhering to fixed timelines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile iPhones are expected to maintain their yearly updates, other products like the Apple Watch and Mac lineup may follow a multi-year or staggered release schedule to make the company's launches less predictable and more flexible. We discuss whether this is a good move for Apple and take stock of its product strategy as a whole in light of recent releases. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div>Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also listen to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5096144.rss\">copy our RSS feed</a> directly into your podcast player.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIf you haven't already listened to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/the-macrumors-show-iphone-16-pro-first-impressions/\">previous episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, catch up for our discussion about the latest rumors surrounding Apple's \"Home Accessory\" product, which could launch as soon as next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSubscribe to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ for new episodes every week, where we discuss some of the topical news breaking here on <em>MacRumors</em>, often joined by interesting guests such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/the-macrumors-show-luke-miani-talks-apple-watch-x/\">Luke Miani</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/the-macrumors-show-matthew-cassinelli/\">Matthew Cassinelli</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/the-macrumors-show-brian-tong-vision-pro/\">Brian Tong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/the-macrumors-show-one-week-with-vision-pro/\">Quinn Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/24/the-macrumors-show-kevin-nether-talks-iphone-16/\">Kevin Nether</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Jared Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Eli Hodapp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/the-macrumors-show-former-apple-executive-mike-bell/\">Mike Bell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/the-macrumors-show-sara-dietschy-apple-accessories/\">Sara Dietschy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/the-macrumors-show-ijustine-talks-iphone-15/\">iJustine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/the-macrumors-show-iphone-15-jon-rettinger/\">Jon Rettinger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/10/the-macrumors-show-andru-edwards-iphone-ultra/\">Andru Edwards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/the-macrumors-show-arnold-kim/\">Arnold Kim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/the-macrumors-show-ben-sullins-apple-car/\">Ben Sullins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/07/the-macrumors-show-marcus-kane-headset-design/\">Marcus Kane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/the-macrumors-show-christopher-lawley-talks-ipados/\">Christopher Lawley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/the-macrumors-show-frank-mcshan-yellow-iphone-14/\">Frank McShan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/the-macrumors-show-david-lewis-talks-apple-audio/\">David Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/the-macrumors-show-tyler-stalman-new-macs/\">Tyler Stalman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/23/the-macrumors-show-apple-2022-jon-prosser-sam-kohl/\">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/02/the-macrumors-show-apple-event-expectations/\">Sam Kohl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/the-macrumors-show-john-gruber-talks-macos-ventura/\">John Gruber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/the-macrumors-show-ipados-16-ft-federico-viticci/\">Federico Viticci</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/26/the-macrumors-show-thomas-frank-talks-productivity/\">Thomas Frank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/21/the-macrumors-show-jonathan-morrison/\">Jonathan Morrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/the-macrumors-show-ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/21/the-macrumors-show-ian-zelbo/\">Ian Zelbo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/the-macrumors-show-rene-ritchie-talks-mac-studio/\">Rene Ritchie</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌The MacRumors Show‌ is on X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\">@MacRumorsShow</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\"></a>, so be sure to give us a follow to keep up with the podcast.
