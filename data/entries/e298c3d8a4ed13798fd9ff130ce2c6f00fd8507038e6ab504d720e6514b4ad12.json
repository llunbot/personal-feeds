And now that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Multi-Device-Keyboard-K480/dp/B00MUTWLW4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the Logitech K480 is on sale at Amazon for $29.98</a>, a savings of nearly 50 percent off its usual $50 price, there’s no excuse to not add it to your setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Logitech K480 is a multi-device keyboard with wide compatibility which includes your Mac, iPad, and iPhone, connecting to them via Bluetooth. Switching between them is done with the help of a dial on the left side of the keyboard, making for a seamless experience. The keyboard is pretty sturdy and weighs 1.8 pounds. That makes sense, however, because it has to be able to support your devices in the 10-inch cradle and balance them off when they are leaned back to offer you the right viewing angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally have this keyboard, and it’s plenty of fun, especially when used with both a smartphone and a tablet in there, making it feel as if you have two full screens. You’d have to slot in your iPhone and iPad vertically, and only if you have the smaller tablet version. With this K480, writing an email, replying to messages on Instagram, and replying to a question on Slack will be super easy without even having to lift your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want one of these yourself to make your life so much easier when working remotely, the Logitech K480 is available at Amazon for just under $30.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Multi-Device-Keyboard-K480/dp/B00MUTWLW4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Logitech K480 keyboard for $29.89 at Amazon</a></p>\nKeyboards</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e298c3d8a4ed13798fd9ff130ce2c6f00fd8507038e6ab504d720e6514b4ad12","category":"Apple"}
