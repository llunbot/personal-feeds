In other words, Mr. Musk, and others in his position, can simply say whatever they like in the public domain, then hide behind the potential for their recorded statements being a deep fake to avoid taking ownership of what they did actually say and do. The Court is unwilling to set such a precedent by condoning Tesla's approach here.\"</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs want Tesla to admit the authenticity of various statements Musk made about the self-driving capabilities in Tesla cars. Pennypacker's tentative ruling ordered Musk to be interviewed for a deposition at which plaintiffs can ask whether he made the statements.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935023#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935023&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"693794400308d09c6ef7d72d4980843ba2613c893896fa3e2bcba523b676bcb7","category":"Tech"}
