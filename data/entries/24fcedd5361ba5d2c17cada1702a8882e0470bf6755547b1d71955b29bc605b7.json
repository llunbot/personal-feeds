That’s 10 times deeper than the ocean on Earth.</p>\n<p>Ganymede is having a moment because NASA’s Juno mission observed salts and organic compounds on its surface, possibly from an ocean that lies beneath its crust of ice. While Juno’s observations can't provide decisive evidence that this moon has an ocean that makes Earth look like a kiddie pool, the Juno findings are the strongest evidence yet of salts and other chemicals making it to the exterior of Ganymede.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983682#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983682&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24fcedd5361ba5d2c17cada1702a8882e0470bf6755547b1d71955b29bc605b7","category":"Tech"}
