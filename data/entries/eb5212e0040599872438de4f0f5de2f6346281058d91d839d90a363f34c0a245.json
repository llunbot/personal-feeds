For instance, 33 percent of people incorrectly believed that US tap water is sterile, containing no living bacteria or other germs. Moreover, 62 percent of people wrongly thought it was safe to use tap water for rinsing your sinuses, 50 percent said it was safe for rinsing contact lenses, and 42 percent thought it was safe for cleaning respiratory devices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010041#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010041&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb5212e0040599872438de4f0f5de2f6346281058d91d839d90a363f34c0a245","category":"Tech"}
