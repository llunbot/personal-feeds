This includes the public frontage of your home or other buildings you occupy. You might even spot yourself, though mapping companies apply automatic blurring to faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to opt out of a property you own or rent appearing in one of these street-level views, you can use a reporting or request method in each service:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Apple:</strong> Apple requires that you email them “to request that a face, license plate, or your own house be censored.” The address is <a href=\"mailto:MapsImageCollection@apple.com\">MapsImageCollection@apple.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Google:</strong> Visit <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://maps.google.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-353725-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">maps.google.com</a> and go to the address of concern.
