When <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/12/bmw-i3-review-a-city-car-for-the-future/\">the electric i3</a> went on sale a decade ago, it looked—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/bmw-abandons-the-i3-the-car-that-could-have-birthed-a-bright-electric-future/\">and still looks, in fact</a>—like nothing else on the road. Fast forward to 2023 and we've reached the point where you'd have to be very observant to spot the differences between the fully electric and internal combustion versions of the new BMW 5 Series. In fact, it's a testament to the importance of the fully electric version that the 2024 BMW i5 is the one the company chose to offer up to the world's journalists for a first drive.</p>\n<p>The eighth-generation 5 Series—internal BMW code G60, for those who keep track—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/bmw-plays-it-safe-with-design-of-new-electric-sedan-the-2024-i5/\">broke cover this past May</a>. It has a more restrained look than other electric BMWs we've driven recently.</p>\n<p>Back when its range was mostly just 3, 5, and 7, they all wore roughly similar kidney grilles. But in the 21st century, BMW has series going from 1 to 8, not to mention SUVs, with almost as many variations of that famous grille among them. Here, it's a horizontal design, and it's technically not a grille if we're being literal—there's no grate or mesh covering a big air inlet. Behind the plastic exterior live some of the car's forward-looking sensors. And for those who think the design is maybe too restrained, you can opt for an illuminated surround.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972273#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972273&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
