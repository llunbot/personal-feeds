The decision has been expected since the IOC announced in February that Brisbane was its “preferred partner,” leaving it as the sole city in contention to host the 2032 Games, in what was an overhaul of the previous system for selecting host cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Brisbane 2032 is the first future host to have been elected under, and to have fully benefited from, the new flexible approach to electing Olympic hosts,” IOC President Thomas Bach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2032 Games will follow the upcoming Tokyo Olympics (officially still called the 2020 Summer Olympics despite having been rescheduled to this year due to the coronavirus pandemic), the 2024 Games in Paris, and the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia has hosted two editions of the Summer Olympics. Melbourne was the first Australian city to host the Games in 1956. More recently, Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympics.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/brisbane-selected-to-host-the-2032-olympics/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"d9063e00ecc532cd73f849343b5ce89beb6936b3e74ab784f725bf935c6b4bb8","category":"Cycling"}
