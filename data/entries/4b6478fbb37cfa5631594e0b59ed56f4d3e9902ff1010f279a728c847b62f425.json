Apple didn’t change much, though it did introduce a larger 13-inch model for the first time. It looks like the wait won’t be so long for the next model—less than a year later, rumors of a new iPad Air are already flying, and we’ve collected everything we know here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 iPad Air release date: When will the new iPad Air launch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spring 2025 (expected)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2024, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-01/apple-readies-iphone-se-4-upgraded-ipad-air-for-early-2025\">reported</a> that Apple will release an iPad Air update at the same time as the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">new iPhone SE</a>, which will likely launch in February. In January 2025, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5\">reiterated</a> that the iPad Air would become available this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">M2 iPad Air</a> was released in May 2024, so a spring 2025 release for a new iPad Air would be short of a year later. Here’s when the past five iPad Air models launched:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365408/11-inch-ipad-air-m2-review.html\">iPad Air (M2)</a>: May 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/625135/ipad-air-m1-review.html\">iPad Air (5th generation)</a>: March 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668049/ipad-air-2020-review-2.html\">iPad Air (4th generation)</a>: October 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667893/ipad-air-2019-review-2.html\">iPad Air (3rd generation)</a>: March 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667277/ipad-air-2-review-one-year-on-still-the-best-mid-size-tablet.html\">iPad Air 2</a>: October 2014</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 iPad Air price: How much will the new iPad Air cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The iPad has remained at $599 since its 2020 redesign.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The price depends on the features of the new model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current 11-inch M2 iPad Air starts at $599/£599 while the 13-inch model starts at $799/£799. 2024 was the first year Apple offers the iPad Air in two sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t heard anything about a potential price increase for the new iPad Air. When Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324814/11-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-neural-engine-design-landscape-camera.html\">M4 iPad Pro in May 2024</a>, it raised the prices by $100/£100, so it’s possible Apple will increase the 2025 iPad Air as well. However, that price hike was also accompanied by a new tandem OLED display, which the iPad Air is unlikely to receive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 iPad Air features: What specs will we see in the new iPad Air?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A new chip is the main upgrade</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other major upgrades are unlikely</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the 2024 iPad Air release, Apple revamped the iPad Air lineup. In addition to creating two sizes (11- and 13-inches), Apple upgraded the chip from an M1 to an M2 and moved the front-facing camera to the landscape edge. Apple made a few smaller changes, such as upgrading Bluetooth to 5.3, Wi-Fi to 6E, and the Smart HDR implementation in the camera to HDR 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 iPad Air is expected to be a chip upgrade without much else. What that new chip will be, however, is in question. When Apple upgraded the iPad Air in 2024 it used the older M2 chip due to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2578508/apples-m3-nightmare-is-coming-to-an-end.html\">numerous issues with the M3</a>. In mid-January 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5\">said</a> that he “wouldn’t be terribly surprised” if the 2024 iPad Air jumped to the M4.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3142.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Air M2 skärm\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3142.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5712w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3142.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3142.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3142.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3142.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3142.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Tthe 2025 iPad Air will feature an M3 or M4 chip.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A private post by leaker <a href=\"https://x.com/evleaks\">Evan Blass</a> in January claims to show what is supposedly an official Apple document that identifies the new iPad Air as with an M3 chip, not an M4. However, that document also contained an image of the iPhone SE 4 with a Dynamic Island, which has been largely debunked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll update this article as more information becomes available.
