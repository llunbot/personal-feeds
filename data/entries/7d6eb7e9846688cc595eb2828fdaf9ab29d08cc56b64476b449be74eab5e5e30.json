But failed technology often dies a million little deaths. To name just a few: Itanium also died in 2013, when Intel effectively <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161109135111/http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/itanium/itanium-kittson-update.html\">decided to stop improving it</a>; in 2017, when the last new Itanium CPUs <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/intels-itanium-cpus-once-a-play-for-64-bit-servers-and-desktops-are-dead/\">shipped</a>; in 2020, when the last Itanium-compatible version of Windows Server <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-server-eos-faq/end-of-support-windows-server-2008-2008r2\">stopped getting updates</a>; and in 2003, when AMD <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/1098/5\">introduced a 64-bit processor lineup</a> that didn't break compatibility with existing 32-bit x86 operating systems and applications.</p>\n<p>Itanium is dying another death in the next version of the Linux kernel. <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-IA-64-Removed-Linux-6.7\">According to Phoronix</a>, all code related to Itanium support is being removed from the kernel in the upcoming 6.7 release after several months of deliberation. Linus Torvalds <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1e0c505e13162a2abe7c984309cfe2ae976b428d\">removed some 65,219 lines of Itanium-supporting code</a> in a commit earlier this week, giving the architecture a \"well-earned retirement as planned.\"</p>\n\n<p>The first Itanium processors were released in mid-2001, the result of years of collaboration between Intel and HP. The initial designs were made for servers, where their parallelized design would (theoretically) be able to speed things up by executing multiple instructions simultaneously. From there, the instruction set would eventually migrate into lower-end servers and then to consumer PCs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980912#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980912&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7d6eb7e9846688cc595eb2828fdaf9ab29d08cc56b64476b449be74eab5e5e30","category":"Tech"}
