A wall of high pressure stood in its westward path, poised to deflect the storm away from Florida and in a grand arc northeast. Heading where, exactly? It was 10 days out from the earliest possible landfall—eons in weather forecasting—but meteorologists at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, or ECMWF, were watching closely. The tiniest uncertainties could make the difference between a rainy day in Scotland or serious trouble for the US Northeast.</p>\n<p>Typically, weather forecasters would rely on models of atmospheric physics to make that call. This time, they had another tool: a new generation of AI-based weather models developed by chipmaker Nvidia, Chinese tech giant <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3\">Huawei</a>, and Google’s AI unit DeepMind. For Lee, the three tech-company models predicted a path that would strike somewhere between Rhode Island and Nova Scotia—forecasts that generally agreed with the official physics-based outlook. Land-ho, somewhere. The devil, of course, was in the details.</p>\n<p>Weather forecasters describe the arrival of AI models with language that seems out of place in their forward-looking profession: “Sudden.” “Unexpected.” “It seemed to just come out of nowhere,” says Mark DeMaria, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University who recently retired from leading a division of the US National Hurricane Center. When he started a project this year with the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration to validate Nvidia’s <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring22-d4113/\">FourCastNet model</a> against real-time storm data, he was a “skeptic” of the new models, he says. “I thought there was no chance that it could work.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971778#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971778&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"47a989e5d5d32c59bafe1131df07510a3269bf2f3d83de72a3b31b3f7b8139b1","category":"Tech"}
