The closest of these objects are billions of kilometers away. There is, however, an outer limit to the Kuiper Belt. Right?</p>\n<p>Until now, it was thought there was nothing beyond 48 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun, (one AU is slightly over 150 million km). It seemed there was little beyond that. That changed when NASAâ€™s New Horizons team detected 11 new objects lurking from 60 to 80 AU. What was thought to be empty space turned out to be a gap between the first ring of Kuiper Belt objects and a new, second ring. Until now, it was thought that our Solar System is unusually small when compared to exosolar systems, but it evidently extends farther out than anyone imagined.</p>\n<p>While these objects are only currently visible as pinpoints of light, and Fraser is allowing room for error until the spacecraft gets closer, what their existence could tell us about the Kuiper Belt and the possible origins of the Solar System is remarkable.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/new-kuiper-belt-objects-lurk-farther-away-than-we-ever-thought/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/new-kuiper-belt-objects-lurk-farther-away-than-we-ever-thought/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d35a2d1960a983d4ef5c4d57f28f70a0d30ec7366266f18c8fcb9b9d68c3ba95","category":"Tech"}
