Usually, premium NFL games like the playoffs are on one of the major TV networks nationwide, but the Dolphin/Chiefs wildcard game was exclusively available on Comcast/NBC's Peacock streaming service outside. NFL fans <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2024/01/14/nfl-fans-sound-off-about-chiefs-dolphins-game-following-playoff-streaming-debut\">weren't particularly happy</a> about having to sign up for some random streaming service to watch a playoff game, but that didn't stop many people from actually signing up, with Nielsen logging <a href=\"https://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2024/01/14/peacock-exclusive-afc-wild-card-game-is-biggest-live-streamed-event-in-u-s-history-drives-internet-usage-to-single-day-u-s-record/\">23 million average streaming viewers</a> for the game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/awfulannouncing/status/1746728117199065465\">NBC says</a> that 23 million viewers make the game \"the most streamed event ever in US history\" and \"a milestone moment in media and sports history.\" Nationally, the game was exclusively on Peacock, but local TV broadcasts were still available in the Miami and Kansas City metro areas, so 27.6 million people watched the game. The NFL hasn't announced the ratings for the other playoff games yet, but <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/nfl-wild-card-2023-tv-ratings-1235303369/\">last year</a>, the wildcard round averaged 28.4 million viewers per game, so this got in range of that. On paper, this was one of the better games of the weekend, featuring the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and the high-flying Dolphins' offense, and it was in prime time, so with a traditional broadcast, this was probably due for above-average ratings. Peacock exclusivity reduced the audience somewhat, but it still attained NFL-class numbers.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Peacock managed to survive pretty well. There aren't widespread reports out there of major problems. Previously, the service had an exclusive regular-season game, a Bills-Chargers week 16 matchup on December 23 that drew <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/bills-chargers-game-on-peacock-draws-7-2-million-viewers-on-average\">7.2 million viewers</a>. That game helped work out the growing pains for Peacock, with <a href=\"https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/nfl/peacock-receives-fierce-pushback-for-technical-difficulties-during-bills-chargers-broadcast/\">users complaining</a> of poor streaming quality and muted colors.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995989#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995989&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c07892c0c5f64c06d064dee01b0ca1cb31c603db843defe25abcdfce7aefd546","category":"Tech"}
