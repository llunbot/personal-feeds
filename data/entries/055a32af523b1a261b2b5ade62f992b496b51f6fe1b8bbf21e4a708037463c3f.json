{"title":"Signal Will Cost $50 Million Per Year to Run","link":"https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/","date":1706136627000,"content":"\n<p>Meredith Whittaker and Joshua Lund, writing for the Signal blog back in November:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Instead of monetizing surveillance, we’re supported by donations, \nincluding a generous initial loan from Brian Acton. Our goal is to \nmove as close as possible to becoming fully supported by small \ndonors, relying on a large number of modest contributions from \npeople who care about Signal. We believe this is the safest form \nof funding in terms of sustainability: ensuring that we remain \naccountable to the people who use Signal, avoiding any single \npoint of funding failure, and rejecting the widespread practice of \nmonetizing surveillance. </p>\n\n<p>But our nonprofit structure doesn’t mean it costs less for Signal \nto produce a globally distributed communications app. Signal is a \nnonprofit, but we’re playing in a lane dominated by \nmulti-billion-dollar corporations that have defined the norms and \nestablished the tech ecosystem, and whose business models directly \ncontravene our privacy mission. So in order to provide a genuinely \nuseful alternative, Signal spends tens of millions of dollars \nevery year. <em>We estimate that by 2025, Signal will require \napproximately $50 million dollars a year to operate — and this is \nvery lean compared to other popular messaging apps that don’t \nrespect your privacy.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Signal funds itself through voluntary donations. Most of its competitors are funded through advertising. But iMessage is funded through <em>device sales</em>. If it costs $50 million per year to operate Signal, I’d guess it costs Apple more than that to run iMessage.</p>\n\n<p>I know the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/beeper\">Beeper thing</a> is last month’s news, but the fact that iMessage costs a lot of money to operate is generally overlooked by those who think Apple should be forced to “open it up”, whatever that might mean.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/signal-50m\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"055a32af523b1a261b2b5ade62f992b496b51f6fe1b8bbf21e4a708037463c3f","category":"Tech"}
