Think again.</h2>\n<p>The campaign's creators are sending AI-generated voice messages—better known as deepfakes—along with text messages “in an effort to establish rapport before gaining access to personal accounts,” FBI officials said. Deepfakes use AI to mimic the voice and speaking characteristics of a specific individual. The differences between the authentic and simulated speakers are often indistinguishable without trained analysis. Deepfake videos work similarly.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/fbi-warns-of-ongoing-scam-that-uses-deepfake-audio-to-impersonate-government-officials/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/fbi-warns-of-ongoing-scam-that-uses-deepfake-audio-to-impersonate-government-officials/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eded461fc79c2d4faff2115a26c7f195f213933f6f54b8d50fa0f9544c20470f","category":"Tech"}
