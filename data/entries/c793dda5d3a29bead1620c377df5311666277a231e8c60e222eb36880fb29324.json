I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dcrainmakerblog\">on Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/dcrainmaker\">Facebook</a>, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><span>Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:</span></h3>\n<p>Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet. Also, there’s a few things this week that were actually from the week prior or so too</p>\n<p><strong>1) <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2021/08/04/how-i-review-2000-olympics-photos-and-deliver-25-right-away/\">How an Olympic photographer shoots and quickly uploads photos to the world:</a> </strong>This dives into the full photographic workflow of how he handles some 2,000 photos per event, all to upload just a few dozen as fast as the social media world requires.</p>\n<p><strong>2) </strong><a href=\"https://dronedj.com/2021/07/24/wild-fpv-video-at-swimming-pool-takes-the-plunge/\"><strong>Super cool drone swimming pool video:</strong></a> You’ve undoubtedly seen various artistic drone FPV videos before, but this is the first time I’ve seen one centered around a swimming pool, and certainly the first time I’ve seen it end with the drone end up *IN* the pool purposefully. Give it a quick watch!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>3) </strong><a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2021/08/02/life-time-inc-buys-sea-otter-classic\"><strong>Life Time buys Sea Otter Classic:</strong></a> Will be interesting to see what impact this has on Sea Otter going forward. With Interbike out of the picture for a few years now, many have felt Sea Otter could become a replacement as the US’s main cycling expo. The ‘challenge’ with that is that Sea Otter is held outdoors, which makes it slightly more challenging from an expo space perspective. Though, as they’ve shown, it didn’t much matter to many cycling companies that flocked to the combo show + cycling race event each year (including myself). This also comes at a time when Sea Otter has been expanding internationally (albeit, with expected COVID related challenges).</p>\n<p><strong>4) </strong><a href=\"https://zwiftinsider.com/how-richmond-was-made/\"><strong>A Few Historical Tidbits on Zwift’s Richmond Map Creation:</strong></a> This quick piece gives some interesting insight into how Zwift managed to convince Richmond race organizers to do a deal on modeling the 2015 World’s course within Zwift.</p>\n<p><strong>5) </strong><a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/lachlan-morton-alt-tour-de-france-harder\"><strong>Lachlan Morton’s Alt Tour Whoop Data</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Whoop published Lachlan Morton’s data from this couple weeks of meandering around France. From the standpoint of ‘That’s kinda neat’, I include this. But it’s funny, because it actually shows what an incredibly inaccurate and useless unit it is. As always, Whoop’s silly arbitrary training load ‘limit’ of 21 means that almost every day is ~0.4 short of 21. While Lachlan was undoubtedly working hard, by his own admission, he wasn’t working so hard that one more kilometer will kill him. Which, should be the definition of topping out – the fact that you’re out of energy. But to theoretically then do it for two weeks shows the concept is simply broken.</p>\n<p><strong>6) </strong><a href=\"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/fitness/2021-connect-iq-developer-award-winners/\"><strong>Garmin announces annual Connect IQ Developer App Award Winners:</strong></a> This small collection of apps includes a bike data field to monitor the wind direction, as well as a watch app for downloading podcasts.  And a few others.</p>\n<p><strong>7) </strong><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/cyclingtips-pinkbike-and-trailforks-join-the-outside-family/\"><strong>CyclingTips acquired by Outside:</strong></a> Knowing many of the crew that works there, I’m happy to see when a small group of folks works hard and gets rewarded for that. Obviously, any time some large entity swallows up a smaller one, people worry – but, I look forward to seeing what comes next.</p>\n<p><strong>8) </strong><a href=\"https://www.pelobuddy.com/behind-the-scenes-of-pelotons-music-royalty-costs/\"><strong>Behind the scenes on music streaming costs and Peloton:</strong></a> I thought this data was kinda interesting. Basically it shows what each platform plays for music streams they use on their platform – from YouTube to Spotify, and even Peloton.</p>\n<p><strong>9) </strong><a href=\"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/fitness/garmin-insidetracker-combo-provides-more-data-to-improve-performance/\"><strong>InsideTracker launches Garmin integration:</strong></a> I looked at InsideTracker many years ago (ok, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2011/12/at-look-at-insidetrackers-nutrition.html\">nearly a decade ago</a>), and undoubtedly it hasn’t probably changed since then. They also recently launched an integration with Garmin that essentially just uses the Garmin Connect API’s to get your Garmin data (namely sleep and resting HR data) to InsideTracker. While this integration has sometimes been portrayed as some coded integration between the two, the reality is that InsideTracker is simply using the existing API’s like any other app out there. There’s absolutely nothing at all wrong with that, but I’ve seen a bit of marketing that occasionally implies otherwise.</p>\n<h3><span>Sports Tech Device Firmware Updates This Week:</span></h3>\n<p>Each week I quickly highlight some of the new firmware, app, software, and website service updates that I see go out. If you’re a sports technology company and release an update – shoot me a quick note (just one-liners are perfect, or Tweet it at me is even better) and I’ll make mention of it here. If I don’t know about it, I won’t be able to post about it.
