Apple and Google have long been criticized for selling devices that are deemed harder to repair than others. Worse, PIRG believes that the two companies are failing to make laptops easier to take apart and fix.</p>\n<p>The \"Failing the Fix (2024)\" report released this week [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FY24-Failing-Fix.pdf\">PDF</a>] is largely based on the repairability index scores required of laptops and some other electronics sold in France. However, the PIRG’s report weighs disassembly scores more than the other categories in France's index, like the availability and affordability of spare parts, “because we think this better reflects what consumers think a repairability score indicates and because the other categories can be country specific,” the report says.</p>\n<p>PIRG's scores, like France’s repair index, also factor in the availability of repair documents and product-specific criteria (the PIRG’s report also looks at phones). For laptops, that criteria includes providing updates and the ability to reset software and firmware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001838#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"022ef8a0cccd9c39226eec6943ff1aa478b6ba3a608ffe4491ef4243a30f3d7a","category":"Tech"}
