Erasure is persistent, remaining even when revisiting a site unless changes are reverted. </li>\r<br />\n<li>A new, quick-access menu emerging from the address bar that consolidates page tools, bringing over some functions that currently sit in the Share Sheet and placing them alongside the new tools.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPadOS and macOS versions of Safari are also expected to align further. These new features are purportedly undergoing evaluation alongside internal builds of ‌iOS 18‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a> ahead of their unveiling at Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC) in June. Earlier this month, backend code on Apple's servers suggested that a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/\">Safari browsing assistant</a> is in the works, corroborating this report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFarther in the future, Apple is said to be working on a more powerful version of Visual Look Up that allows users to obtain information on products when browsing through images. The feature is expected to be released sometime in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that ‌iOS 18‌ will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ios-18-notes-mail-photos-fitness-rumors/\">\"overhaul\" many of Apple's built-in apps</a>, including Notes, Mail, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and Fitness. Apple's next-generation operating systems are almost certain to be previewed during Apple's WWDC keynote on June 10, and the updates should be widely released in the fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/appleinsider-com/\">AppleInsider</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">New AI Features Reportedly Coming to Safari in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ai-features-reportedly-coming-to-safari-in-ios-18.2425199/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d81aafc3e46ee89e9ffd83989f7a9095cf761065e976247cdb2a57ee137e3e7b","category":"Apple"}
