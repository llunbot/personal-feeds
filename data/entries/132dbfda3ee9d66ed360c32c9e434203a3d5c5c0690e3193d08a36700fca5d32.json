{"title":"★ Tim Sweeney Says the Quiet Part Out Loud","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2021/11/sweeney_quiet_part_out_loud","date":1637791346000,"content":"\n<p>Vlad Savov and Sohee Kim, reporting last week for Bloomberg, “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/apple-must-be-stopped-and-google-s-crazy-epic-games-ceo-says\">Apple, Google Monopoly Over Apps Must Be Stopped, Epic Games CEO Says</a>”:<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2021-11-24\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Epic Games Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney renewed his\nattack on Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the world’s\ndominant mobile duopoly before calling for a universal app store\nthat works across all operating systems as the solution.</p>\n\n<p>“What the world really needs now is a single store that works with\nall platforms,” Sweeney said in an interview in Seoul on Tuesday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, a note to Bloomberg editors: two companies can’t possess a monopoly. The word you’re looking for is <em>duopoly</em> — or, (very) arguably, <em>monopolies</em>, plural. Second: the solution to an ostensibly problematic duopoly is ... a single universal store? And we’re supposed to take this without laughing?</p>\n\n<p>And, gee, I wonder which company Tim Sweeney thinks should own and run this store?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Right now software ownership is fragmented between the iOS App\nStore, the Android Google Play marketplace, different stores on\nXbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, and then Microsoft Store\nand the Mac App Store.” Epic is working with developers and\nservice providers to create a system that would allow users “to\nbuy software in one place, knowing that they’d have it on all\ndevices and all platforms.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/14/orland-epic-game-consoles\">I’ve been arguing all along</a> that, if victorious in their lawsuits against Apple and Google’s <em>mobile app</em> console platforms, Epic would surely turn its sights on Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft’s <em>game</em> console platforms, using their win over Apple and Google as precedent. When pressed on this — why Epic was going after the iOS and Android app stores, but not the Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox game stores (and in fact, <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent\">gave those game console stores a 20 percent <em>discount</em></a> after launching their seemingly ill-fated jihad against Apple and Google) — Sweeney has previously given <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1273276548569841667\">a hand-wavy justification</a> about game console platforms being acceptable because the hardware itself isn’t profitable.</p>\n\n<p>That reeked of bullshit from the get-go. Now he’s made it clear. Epic got their clocks cleaned in their lawsuit against Apple, and now Sweeney’s having a tantrum and letting it all hang out. If I were on the PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch store teams, I wouldn’t trust Epic as far as I could throw them.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Bloomberg, of course, remains the outfit that <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack\">shit its journalistic pants with The Big Hack</a> — a blockbuster report that no one, including Bloomberg, has ever produced a single shred of evidence to back up — yet not only never retracted it but in fact <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con\">still “stands behind” it</a> even though it’s rather clear they hope everyone just forgets about it. So take anything they publish with a Big Hack-sized grain of salt. Why even link to Bloomberg at all, you might ask? Because Bloomberg is an essential news organization. They often have scoops and original reporting no one else does. If they report something that is also reported elsewhere, I link elsewhere. But when they break news — as they did here — they deserve the link. I won’t let go of this Big Hack fiasco because Bloomberg is too good an institution to leave such an egregious and high-profile mistake uncorrected. <a href=\"#fnr1-2021-11-24\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"132dbfda3ee9d66ed360c32c9e434203a3d5c5c0690e3193d08a36700fca5d32","category":"Tech"}
