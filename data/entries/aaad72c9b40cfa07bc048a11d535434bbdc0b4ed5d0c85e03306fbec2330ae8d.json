And today’s Black Friday deal makes it an incredible deal too: <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1668351-REG/apple_mbp_16_sl_26_16_2_macbook_pro_with.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249&amp;SID=1-1-2153348-1-0-0\">B&amp;H Photo is selling the 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max processor, 64GB of RAM, and 4TB of storage for $2,799</a>, an absurd savings of $2,100 and the best price we’ve ever seen. In fact, it’s cheaper than any of the <em>entry-level</em> M3 Max models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Max processor is from 2021, but it’s still one of the fastest chips ever made, with a 10-core CPU and 32-core GPU. And this model ups the performance with 64GB of memory and 4TB of storage. Along with those high-end specs, you’ll also get a stunning 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion, True Tone, Wide color P3, and 1,600 nits of peak brightness, more than 20 hours of battery life, and loads of expansion, including three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card reader, HDMI, and MagSafe for fast charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than the chip, this model has a slightly slower Wi-Fi chip (6 vs 6E), Bluetooth 5.0 instead of Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.0 instead of 2.1 so you’ll have fewer external display options. But at this price, those compromises won’t matter at all.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"aaad72c9b40cfa07bc048a11d535434bbdc0b4ed5d0c85e03306fbec2330ae8d","category":"Apple"}
