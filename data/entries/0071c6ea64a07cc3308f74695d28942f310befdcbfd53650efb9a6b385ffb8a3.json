Likewise, there's no way of knowing if the feature would be available on all Macs or be exclusive to certain models, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/\">upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> rumored to drop this fall. Apple is expected to release ‌macOS Monterey‌ in the next few weeks.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/high-power-mode-for-macs-macos-monterey-beta-8/\">Macs May Be Getting 'High Power Mode' Option to Boost Performance, According to Latest macOS Monterey Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macs-may-be-getting-high-power-mode-option-to-boost-performance-according-to-latest-macos-monterey-beta.2314334/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=J-WwADPNVIo:AQxPiVvqBTo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=J-WwADPNVIo:AQxPiVvqBTo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/J-WwADPNVIo\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0071c6ea64a07cc3308f74695d28942f310befdcbfd53650efb9a6b385ffb8a3","category":"Apple"}
