{"title":"Petey: ChatGPT App for Apple Watch","link":"https://apps.apple.com/app/watchgpt/id6446047813?l=en","date":1678904019000,"content":"\n<p>Briefly known as “WatchGPT” but now renamed to Petey (perhaps because the App Store is cracking down on apps with “GPT” in their names), this is a super-simple ChatGPT app for Apple Watch by Hidde van der Ploeg. I’ve been using it for a week or so and it’s occasionally been genuinely handy. With other devices, you can just search the web for answers to questions. Oftentimes, when you ask a question to Siri, you get redirected to a web search. But if all you have handy at the moment is your watch, a web search is useless. Petey gives good answers to a <em>lot</em> of questions. I dig the simple aesthetic too — using SF Mono for the type gives the app an appropriately robotic feel.</p>\n\n<p>$5 one-time purchase in the App Store.
