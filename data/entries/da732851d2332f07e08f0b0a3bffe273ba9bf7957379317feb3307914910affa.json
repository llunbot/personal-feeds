This is effectively the same functionality found on most DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, where the shutter button features two stages: Pressing it down half way locks in focus or exposure and pressing it down all of the way capture a photo. The leaker added that the debut of the Capture Button reinforces the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s pivot toward photography.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs explained in an early look at the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/\">iPhone 16 prototypes</a>, the Capture Button will be located on the bottom right side of the ‌iPhone 16‌. It will take the place of the mmWave antenna on U.S. ‌iPhone‌ models, with the mmWave antenna to be relocated to the left side of the device below the volume and Action buttons. Non-U.S. models do not have a mmWave antenna that needs to be relocated in order to accommodate the Capture Button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a mixed track record in terms of revealing accurate information about Apple's plans.
