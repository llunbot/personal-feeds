They will be made of Italian leather and crafted in Germany, accompanied by a colour-matching fabric Light Seal. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-bandwerk-1.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will seemingly not offer Vision Pro in different color options, nor will the company offer multiple headbands, meaning that third-party accessories will be the only way to achieve a more unique look with the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-bandwerk-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headbands currently only exist as a concept, but BandWerk says that it plans to offer the headbands in early 2024 when Vision Pro launches. BandWerk notes that the product is still in development, so minor design details may yet change before it goes on sale. BandWerk says that the leather headbands will retail for $159 in the United States and £129 in the United Kingdom. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/first-third-party-headbands-for-apple-vision-pro/\">First Third-Party Headbands for Apple Vision Pro Offer Leather Finishes and Multiple Color Options</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-third-party-headbands-for-apple-vision-pro-offer-leather-finishes-and-multiple-color-options.2391846/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ca03b40fc991a16fd8b940014677b07816f79bceb0aeb494c763b911633c838c","category":"Apple"}
