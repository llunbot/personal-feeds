Early this\nyear, I wanted a way to look this up that was native to\niOS/iPadOS, but also fast, with no fluff that I wasn’t interested\nin. I wanted a bespoke version of the IMDB app.</p>\n\n<p>So I wrote it. It’s called Callsheet, and I’d love for you to try\nit. Callsheet is a subscription-based app, but all subscription\nplans have a one-week free trial. Additionally, your first twenty\nsearches are free, before you’re compelled to subscribe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A few years ago I switched from IMDB to The Movie Database (TMDB) for my movie/TV lookups. IMDB, once great, is now laden with obtrusive ads to an extent that is user-hostile. But I’d been vaguely wishing that there were a top-notch native iPhone TMDB app. Callsheet is that app. I’ve been beta-testing it for months, and ever since, Callsheet has been one of the few apps I use almost daily. Super-useful, super-convenient.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/07/callsheet\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d3f57c3f45bbc41ae00d8f30d9ae6176796432597a8ba64ff93fa6cf786ad07c","category":"Tech"}
