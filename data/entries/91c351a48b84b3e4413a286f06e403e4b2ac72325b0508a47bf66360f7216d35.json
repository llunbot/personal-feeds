This is the subject of surprisingly feverish speculation: Is yellow going to face the axe in 2024? Will white make the cut? What’s the fate of green?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest word, in fact, is that white is in and yellow is out, at least on the standard iPhone models. On the Pro and Pro Max for 2024, meanwhile, we’re believed to be getting a new “rose” finish. This is all according to Ming-Chi Kuo, a reputable analyst with a long history of decently accurate predictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Apple land, rose generally means a pinkish gold. It was highly popular back in the days of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, but has been scarce since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>2H24 iPhone 16系列機殼顏色預測<br /><br />iPhone 16 Pro &amp; Pro Max：黑色、白色 (或銀色)、灰色 (應該是原色鈦金屬)、玫瑰<br />iPhone 16 &amp; 16 Plus：黑色、綠色、粉紅、藍色、白色  <br /><br />Apple可能對顏色會有不同的稱呼 (如先前稱呼白色為星光色)。此外，即便顏色名稱與既有機種相同，但看起來可能會不一樣。 <br /><br />–…</p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1792223282361680169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2339731-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 19, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the colors will stay largely the same, although Kuo warns that some finishes will keep the same name but look slightly different, while others will look the same but get a new name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leaves us with the following changes, with the new or discontinued colors in bold:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16 (predicted): black, green, pink, blue, <strong>white</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15: black, green, pink, blue, <strong>yellow</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16 Pro (predicted): black, white/silver, gray/Natural Titanium, <strong>rose</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro: Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, <strong>Blue Titanium</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15’s color palette is notably very pale, so the inclusion of white could mean that Apple will be injecting brighter shades into the iPhone 16. Furthermore, the iPhone 16 Pro’s rumored color options suggest Apple will be moving away from highlighting the use of titanium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While his accuracy is generally strong, Kuo is quite a cautious analyst: he rarely sticks his neck out with radical, eye-catching predictions. And these claims have been proposed before. The theory that rose would replace Blue Titanium was first spotted on Chinese social media <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2279877/iphone-16-pro-colors-rose-gold-space-black.html\">back in March</a>, while white’s comeback was being discussed <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2300915/latest-iphone-16-rumors-reveal-new-colors-minor-changes-in-battery-capacity.html\">in April</a>. In other words, Kuo’s post is best regarded as corroboration rather than new speculation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news and rumors about this fall’s announcements, check our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 superguide</a>.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"91c351a48b84b3e4413a286f06e403e4b2ac72325b0508a47bf66360f7216d35","category":"Apple"}
