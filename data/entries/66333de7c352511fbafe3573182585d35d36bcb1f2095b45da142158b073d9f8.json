It's November 14, and today's photograph is drop-dead gorgeous. It features an astronomical feature known as Arp 273â€”so named because it was part of an atlas of peculiar galaxies compiled by American astronomer Halton Arp six decades ago.</p>\n<p>In this case, Arp 273 is not one but two galaxies located about 300 million light-years from Earth. The two spiral galaxies are in the process of interacting with one another, and astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2011-04-galactic-rose-highlights-hubble-21st.html\">believe</a> the distinct signs of intense star formation in the nucleus of the smaller galaxy were probably triggered by the encounter with the larger one.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983483#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983483&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66333de7c352511fbafe3573182585d35d36bcb1f2095b45da142158b073d9f8","category":"Tech"}
