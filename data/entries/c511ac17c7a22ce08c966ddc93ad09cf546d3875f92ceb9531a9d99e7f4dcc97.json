Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>When Volvo first announced its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/driving-the-volvo-ex30-a-36k-ev-that-prioritizes-sustainability/\">small, all-electric EX30</a>, I was excited. Regardless of powertrain, a brand-new Volvo starting at approximately $35,000 was a big deal to me. I might have even suggested online that the EX30 was the most important Volvo ever, full stop. There's no reason why this vehicle shouldn't be a global sales success.</p>\n<p>Then, former-President Joe Biden gave the Volvo a reason why it wouldn't be a sales success:<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/biden-set-to-levy-100-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-this-week/\"> He attached a 100 percent tariff</a> on all-electric vehicles coming from China. With Volvo's parent Geely manufacturing the EX30 in China, the value proposition quickly vanished. Fortunately for Volvo, there is a production facility in Ghent, Belgium, that can pick up the slack for export to the United States. The plant currently builds the EC40 and XC40 Recharge, so adding another battery-electric vehicle shouldn't take too much time.</p>\n<p>Why do I care? Because the EX30 I was the most excited about wasn't the street-focused standard model but the off-the-beaten-path-but-not-really-off-road Cross Country variant.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/volvo-added-plenty-of-charm-to-the-ex30-cross-country-ev/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/volvo-added-plenty-of-charm-to-the-ex30-cross-country-ev/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chad Kirchner","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c511ac17c7a22ce08c966ddc93ad09cf546d3875f92ceb9531a9d99e7f4dcc97","category":"Tech"}
