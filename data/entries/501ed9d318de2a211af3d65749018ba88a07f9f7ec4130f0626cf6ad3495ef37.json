{"title":"Apple Passwords’ Generated Strong Password Format","link":"https://rmondello.com/2024/10/07/apple-passwords-generated-strong-password-format/","date":1729202155000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/17/dhh-argues-against-passkeys\">Speaking of passwords</a>, Ricky Mondello — who has long been a leading member of Apple’s “Authentication Experience” team — has an interesting blog post describing the algorithm Apple uses when it suggests new strong passwords:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To make these passwords easier to type on suboptimal keyboard\nlayouts like my colleague’s game controller, where the mode\nswitching might be difficult, these new passwords are actually\ndominated by lowercase characters. And to make it easier to\nshort-term have in your head little chunks of it to bring over to\nthe other device, the passwords are based on syllables. That’s\nconsonant, vowel, consonant patterns. With these considerations\nput together, in our experience, these passwords are actually a\nlot easier to type on a foreign, weird keyboard, in the rare\ninstances where that might be needed for some of our users.</p>\n\n<p>And we weren’t going to make any changes to our password format\nunless we can guarantee that it was as strong or stronger than our\nold format. So if you want to talk in terms of Shannon entropy\nonce again, these new passwords have 71 bits of entropy, up from\nthe 69 from the previous format. And a little tidbit for folks who\nare trying to match our math — [note that] we actually have a\ndictionary of offensive terms on device that we filter these\ngenerated passwords against and we’ll skip over passwords that we\ngenerate that contain those offensive substrings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve noticed some of these details, like that the passwords are comprised of little “fake words” and are dominated by lowercase letters, but I hadn’t noticed all of them. It’s a bunch of clever little touches, all in the aim of making strong passwords that are <em>convenient</em> in odd situations (like typing them with a game controller).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/17/mondello-apple-password-format\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"501ed9d318de2a211af3d65749018ba88a07f9f7ec4130f0626cf6ad3495ef37","category":"Tech"}
