{"title":"Mads Pedersen's Trek Madone: Danish 25 year old is chasing rainbows at the Worlds","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/trek/madone/10127/mads-pedersen-trek-madone-pro-bike","date":1632499519000,"content":"<span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/will-strickson\">Will Strickson</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>24 Sep 2021</span></div>    </div></div><p>\nAfter Covid limited his races in the rainbow bands last time out, Mads Pedersen is looking to take them back for the Danish Grand Depart</p>\n<div>\n      <p> It was quite a day when Mads Pedersen, only 23 at the time, won the World Championships road race in the rain in <a href=\"/news/7112/world-championships-2019-mads-pedersen-wins-elite-mens-road-race\" target=\"_self\">Harrogate in 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>He'd only won a few professional races and was only at the start of his career and the rainbow jersey was his. Then Covid struck, meaning his season in the jersey was cruelly shortened to only a few races.</p>\n<p>Now it seems like the stars are aligning again. Denmark have a historically strong squad. The parcours are very suited to Pedersen's classics specialist/sprinter combination. The Tour de France Grand Depart 2022 is in Denmark, for three stages. The second stage passes 200 metres from his house. <em>Cyclist </em>steers clear of exclamation marks but there would be one there.</p>\n<p>He also <a href=\"/news/9126/mads-pedersen-stuyven-and-i-are-a-pair-of-kings-for-the-classics\" target=\"_self\">told us in January</a> that his dream was to win the rainbow bands back so he can ride Paris-Roubaix in the jersey.</p>\n<p>With all that in mind, we thought it only right to take a closer look at the bike Pedersen will be racing on in Flanders on Sunday.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9910/womens-tour-2021-stage-routes-revealed\">Women's Tour 2021 stage routes revealed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9247/womens-tour-2021-postponed\">Women's Tour 2021 postponed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/5348/womens-tour-expands-to-six-stages-for-2019\">Women's Tour expands to six stages for 2019</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAlthough I'm not a fan of the enormous downtube logo, his 56cm Trek Madone is a beast. It comes equipped with Bontrager's <a href=\"/news/9485/bontrager-aeolus-rsl-its-fastest-wheels-ever\" target=\"_self\">'fastest ever' Aeolus RSL 51 wheels</a>, with an integrated carbon stem and a Bontrager Verse Pro carbon railed saddle.</p>\n<p>He'll be hoping the incredibly clean flat-top chain of his SRAM Red eTap AXS groupset, with a 54/41 chainset and a 10/32 cassette.</p>\n<p>Leaving nothing to chance, his bottle cages have been rubbed in grip paste to prevent the bottles from jumping. So you can be sure if he doesn't win he'll at least be hydrated.</p>\n<p><em>Photos: Alex Duffill</em></p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10124/mads-pedersens-trek-madone-photos#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/mads-pedersen-trek-madone-3.jpg?itok=4phu2160\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>7</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10124/mads-pedersens-trek-madone-photos\">Mads Pedersen's Trek Madone photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/alex-duffill\">Alex Duffill</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>24 Sep 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10124%2Fmads-pedersens-trek-madone-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Mads%20Pedersen%27s%20Trek%20Madone%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10124%2Fmads-pedersens-trek-madone-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Mads%20Pedersen%27s%20Trek%20Madone%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10124%2Fmads-pedersens-trek-madone-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Mads%20Pedersen%27s%20Trek%20Madone%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10124%2Fmads-pedersens-trek-madone-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10124/mads-pedersens-trek-madone-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/mads-pedersen-trek-madone-1.jpg?itok=RkRNACQb\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"141be4496ecad9998d8753e7991095150984bd176319014ecc4d9e9387fd7374","category":"Cycling"}
