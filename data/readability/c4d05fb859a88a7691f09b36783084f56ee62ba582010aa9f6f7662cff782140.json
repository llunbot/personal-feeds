In others, the idea of taking a bicycle to the store for a grocery run while leaving the car at home is still a wacky concept. But even in those car-centric places, cargo bike conceptions are slowly changing. Now, Momentum is hoping to enter the #carryshitolympics with their new PakYak E+—their first e-cargo bike.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08.jpg\" alt=\"momentum pakyak e+\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10155858/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery08-768x512.jpg 768w\"></p><p>The PakYak E+ is a burly machine. The class 3 e-bike tops out at 28 mph and boasts a quick recharge time and respectable range with battery help from Panasonic. It gets an automatic shifting internal gear rear hub from <a href=\"https://www.shimano.com/en/manufacturing/bicycle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shimano</a>, and the SyncDrive Pro motor cranks out 80Nm of torque so you can keep speed and stability even when you’re weighed down. Beefy four-piston disc brakes make it stop regardless. And riders can add an auxiliary battery to double the 60-mile standard range.</p><p>Finally, an array of baskets, racks, and lockable storage cases give riders plenty of ways to carry the load.</p><p>“The PakYak E+ is the ultimate cargo E-bike for everything from carrying kids to school, bringing home groceries or enjoying a weekend adventure,” said Phoebe Liu, chief branding officer of Giant Group, which includes Giant, Liv, Momentum and CADEX brands. “With the ability to use an optional auxiliary battery to go further, the PakYak E+ gives riders another reason to leave their cars at home.”</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10160022/pakyak_electric_bike_gallery021.jpg\"
