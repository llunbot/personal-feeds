These can't all be vacations, and there's only so much shopping, golfing, or streaming one can do. A few of these times off are even unexpected, such that people with kids might even have some rare time to themselves.</p>\n<p>I have a suggestion for some part of one of these days: Declare a Tech Guilt Absolution Day. Sit down, gather up the little computer and phone stuff you love that more people should know about, or free things totally worth a few bucks, and blitz through ratings, reviews, and donations.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I am using the term \"guilt,\" not \"<a href=\"https://brenebrown.com/articles/2013/01/15/shame-v-guilt/\">shame</a>.\" I do not believe any modern human should feel bad about themselves for all the things they have failed to like, rate, <em>and</em> subscribe to. The modern ecosystems of useful little applications, games, podcasts, YouTube videos, newsletters, and the like demand far more secondary engagement than anyone can manage. Even if you purchase something or subscribe, the creators you appreciate, swimming upstream in the torrential rapids of the attention economy, can always use some attention. So I suggest we triage as best we can.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031661#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031661&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"21c5bd694947a97a1420946c098c9f35b8e0dc7e2b777c6b55e9ed8e7eae1ce7","category":"Tech"}
