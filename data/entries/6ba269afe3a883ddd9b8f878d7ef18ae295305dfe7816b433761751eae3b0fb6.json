Maybe you need to include a receipt, registration, or other form of proof in an online form. Or, you want to keep copies of your important documents in the cloud, so they’re always accessible and safe from being lost or destroyed. Such documents are often digitized as Portable Document Format files (or PDFs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be that you needed to use either dedicated hardware or a third-party iPhone app to take a photo of a document and convert it to PDF. That is no longer the case: Apple includes a very handy document scanner in the iPhone’s Notes and Files apps, and it does a surprisingly good job of capturing most documents and converting them to PDF. Because it’s not very obvious, you’d be forgiven for not even knowing it exists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how you scan documents using an iPhone. We also cover how to convert the scan into a PDF and how to autofill the PDF on an iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668866/best-free-pdf-editors-for-mac.html\">round up of the best free PDF editors for Mac</a> and explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672595/how-to-edit-a-pdf-on-mac.html\">How to edit a PDF on a Mac</a>.

There are two modes: if you use Auto (the word Auto appears in the upper-right corner), Notes captures a page whenever it detects a document. Most of the time the results are pretty accurate, but if they aren’t good enough you can switch to Manual by tapping Auto in the top right, then you can drag the corners to adjust the scan until you are happy. Keystoning will be applied.  (Keystoning is the effect of a rectangle appearing to be a different shape when not captured—or projected as with a slide projector—absolutely squarely.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once you are happy with the scan, tap <em>Keep Scan</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Continue scanning until all pages are captured, or tap <em>Save</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Notes will attempt to extract some text at the top of the document to use as its title.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>How to turn a scan into a PDF on iPhone</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Save-Notes-scan-as-PDF.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"How to save iPhone scan as PDF\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The method above allows you to scan a document into Notes, which is useful if you want to store your scans in Notes.
