They note that the 54-year-old man, like several others in the state who contracted the disease, reported no established risk factors that might explain their infection. He hadn't traveled abroad, where he could have picked up the infection, or had any exposure to armadillos, which live in Florida and naturally carry the bacteria that cause leprosy. He also didn't have any prolonged contact with people from leprosy-endemic countries or connections to anyone known to have leprosy.</p>\n<p>But he did spend a lot of time outdoors; he worked as a landscaper. In fact, many of the recent Florida cases lacked traditional risk factors but reported spending a lot of time outdoors. The similarity \"supports the investigation into environmental reservoirs as a potential source of transmission,\" the doctors wrote.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959775#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959775&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cf03969c5ac2a2e48287d7c3b5c6334e5dea77a12cf9df3a2111d53e97affd19","category":"Tech"}
