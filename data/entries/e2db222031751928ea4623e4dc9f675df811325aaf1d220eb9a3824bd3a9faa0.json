{"title":"Apple’s ‘Crush’ Ad for the New iPad Pros Is, Well, Getting Crushed","link":"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-ipad-pro-ad-criticism-hugh-grant-1235996294/","date":1715202335000,"content":"\n<p>Todd Spangler, writing for Variety:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An Apple commercial for the new iPad Pro tablet showing an\nindustrial press literally crushing a TV, musical instruments,\nbooks and more ignited an angry backlash among many in Hollywood\nand other creative industries.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc\">The ad, titled “Crush!”</a>, shows an array of various\nobjects — including a record player, a piano, a guitar, an old TV\nset, cameras, a typewriter, books, paint cans and a classic arcade\ngame machine — getting compressed into (<em>voila!</em>) the new iPad\nPro. The spot is soundtracked to Sonny and Cher’s “All I Ever Need\nIs You.”</p>\n\n<p>But the ad has been interpreted more as a visual depiction of the\ntech industry’s devastation of cultural industries. “The\ndestruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,”\nactor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackedOffHugh/status/1788183871504204257\">Hugh Grant commented</a> on X.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Personally, I didn’t think twice about this spot when it ran during the keynote yesterday. I didn’t love it, but I didn’t hate it either. I sort of like seeing things get smashed, run over, or, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvuIvDHYhZA\">best of all</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xWs3l_QBeo\">dropped from rooftops</a>, and that’s really all I took from it at the moment. <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/240508/p35#a240508p35\">But a lot of people find the spot unpleasant</a>, if not downright disturbing, not because they’re bothered by seeing stuff get smushed but because of the implied message. To wit, as Grant quipped, that technology not only replaces analog instruments and objects of artistic expression, but destroys them.</p>\n\n<p>Thought about that way, it’s clearly a mistake — the vivisection of technology and liberal arts.</p>\n\n<p>The best response is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rezawrecktion/status/1788211832936861950\">this “fixed it for you” version</a> from filmmaker Reza Sixo Safai, simply running the commercial backwards (and choosing a better Sonny and Cher song). Same message, but emphasizing creation rather than destruction.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/08/apple-crush\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e2db222031751928ea4623e4dc9f675df811325aaf1d220eb9a3824bd3a9faa0","category":"Tech"}
