So naturally Lionsgate has released one final trailer to whet audience appetites for what promises to be a fiery, action-packed addition to the hugely successful franchise.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for 2019's <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>.)</strong></p>\n<p>Chronologically, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/its-ana-de-armas-vs-john-wick-in-new-ballerina-trailer/\"><em>Ballerina</em> takes place</a> during the events of <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/high-octane-ballerina-trailer-has-plenty-of-action-and-a-john-wick-cameo/\">previously reported</a>, <em>Parabellum</em> found Wick declared excommunicado from the High Table for killing crime lord Santino D'Antonio on the grounds of the Continental. On the run with a bounty on his head, he makes his way to the headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston). The Director also trains young girls to be ballerina-assassins, and one young ballerina (played by Unity Phelan) is shown rehearsing in the scene. That dancer, Eve Macarro, is the main character in <em>Ballerina</em>, now played by de Armas.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/ana-de-armas-is-caught-in-wicks-crosshairs-in-final-ballerina-trailer/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/ana-de-armas-is-caught-in-wicks-crosshairs-in-final-ballerina-trailer/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c1c88a4f3c5d5d09f0f29b2d9db28e92ae3ae5e8ba96287a8a9305a394db0e70","category":"Tech"}
