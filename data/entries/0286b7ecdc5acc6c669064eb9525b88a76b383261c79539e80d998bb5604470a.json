I read the raves from reviewers, saw the game and its eye-catching minimalism in YouTube channels, and knew it had the stamp of approval from the types who spent days planning out <em>D&amp;D</em> 5e one-shots.</p>\n<p>And yet I avoided it because I wasn't sure it was my type of game. I don't enjoy bullet-hell games, and <em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors </em>looked like one of the lowest levels of Dante's Bullet Hell, painted with a kitschy SNES tile set.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/how-deep-rock-galactics-dwarf-miners-have-helped-me-survive-the-pandemic/\"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a>, on the other hand, is very much my type of game. When the creator of <em>DRG</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6koRh1v3nU\">announced</a> a few months back that it would publish a <em>Survivors-</em>like game from developer Funday Games, set in the same universe of mining, shooting, and goofing, it felt inevitable that I'd give it a go. Instead of \"a go,\" though, I've given <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/\"><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em></a> hours and hours over the past week, and I don't remember them passing at all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950988#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950988&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0286b7ecdc5acc6c669064eb9525b88a76b383261c79539e80d998bb5604470a","category":"Tech"}
