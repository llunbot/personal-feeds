{"title":"iOS 18.2 Features: Everything New in iOS 18.2","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-features/","date":1733957678000,"content":"iOS 18.2 is the second major update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, and it brings the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> image generation features, ChatGPT integration with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and plenty more changes and bug fixes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Everything-New-in-iOS-18.2-Feature.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThis guide highlights everything that's new in iOS 18.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2>\r<br />\nThere are several new ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features in iOS 18.2, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a>. It's a more fun update than iOS 18.1 thanks to the image generation features.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Image Playground</strong> - There's an ‌Image Playground‌ app and Messages integration for creating stylized images based on prompts and images of you and your friends.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Image Wand</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-wand/\">Image Wand</a> is for adding images to what you've written in the Notes app. On <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, you can use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> to make a rough sketch and have ‌Image Wand‌ turn it into something nicer.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Genmoji</strong> - With ‌Genmoji‌, you can create custom emoji. It's similar to ‌Image Playground‌, but on a smaller emoji-sized scale. People that have iOS 18.1 installed will see ‌Genmoji‌ and can even get information about them, but they can only be created in iOS 18.2. In earlier versions of iOS and on Android devices, they show up as an image.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Siri ChatGPT</strong> - ‌Siri‌ can now hand over requests to ChatGPT, a feature that's entirely opt-in. You don't need an account, and anything you ask ‌Siri‌ can be sent to ChatGPT if you want. ChatGPT has more advanced info than ‌Siri‌ and can also generate images and text. If you want to make it simpler to turn requests over to ChatGPT, you can toggle off the Ask Every Time setting so ‌Siri‌ doesn't always need your permission to contact ChatGPT. ‌Siri‌ with ChatGPT integration supports on-screen responses, so you can do things like ask \"what's in this photo?\" when you're looking at an image.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Visual Intelligence</strong> - On <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, Visual Intelligence can be used to identify objects and places around you. Long press the Camera Control button to get to Visual Intelligence, and then point your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> at something. You can get hours and reviews if the camera is looking at a restaurant, copy text, get text read aloud, search for items on Google, ask ChatGPT questions about objects, and more.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Writing Tools</strong> - The Rewrite Writing Tools feature is no longer limited to three styles. You can describe the tone or content that you want, such as adding more dynamic words or turning an email into a poem.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Languages</strong> - With iOS 18.2, ‌Apple Intelligence‌ supports English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK in addition to U.S. English, so if you're in Canada, you no longer have to set your ‌iPhone‌ to U.S. English to use ‌Apple Intelligence‌.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nWe have a much <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-1-features/\">more in-depth Apple Intelligence guide</a> that goes over all of the available features, which is well worth checking out. We also have individual guides on the new additions in iOS 18.2.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Everything You Need to Know About Apple Intelligence</a></li>\r<br />\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">All of the Image Playground Features</a></li>\r<br />\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji in iOS 18.2: Everything You Need to Know</a></li>\r<br />\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri-apple-intelligence/\">Siri's Apple Intelligence Features</a></li>\r<br />\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-wand/\">Apple Intelligence Image Wand: All the New Features in iOS 18.2</a></li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n<h2>Camera Control</h2>\r<br />\nFor ‌iPhone 16‌ users, there's now an option lock your auto exposure and auto focus settings with a light press. The AE/AF Lock toggle can be turned on by going to Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Camera Control.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-ae-af-lock-camera-control.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThere is also an option to adjust the double click speed of Camera Control. Options include Default, Slow, and Slower. The adjustment options join prior options to tweak the double light press speed and the light press force.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs mentioned above, Camera Control now supports Visual Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also adds a new setting for the Camera Control button. In the Settings app under Display &amp; Brightness, there is now a toggle for \"Require Screen On.\" When this setting is turned on, you can only launch the Camera app or a supported third-party camera app with the Camera Control button when the ‌iPhone‌'s screen is turned on.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-18-2-Beta-3-Camera-Control-Screen-On-Setting.jpg\" width=\"1206\" height=\"461\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mail App Categorization</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Mail app, there are new built-in categories for separating out important emails, deals, newsletters, transaction emails, and more. ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is required for Mail app categorization.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Mail-Categorization.png\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe Mail app includes bigger pictures for contacts and businesses, and all emails from a single person or source will be pooled together.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can swap between categories (the new option) and List View (the non-categorization standard view) by tapping on the three dots in the upper right corner of the app. In the Mail section of the Settings app, you may need to go to Notifications &gt; Customize Notifications &gt; and toggle on All Unread Messages if you're using list view, because the other setting only shows you unread messages categorized as \"Primary,\" which can be confusing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Tweaked Video Player and More in Photos App</h2>\r<br />\nApple added a tweaked video player that takes up more of the screen in iOS 18.2. This change eliminates the thick borders around videos that appear on earlier ‌iOS 18‌ versions, meaning you no longer have to tap on a video for full-screen playback.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-video-player.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's now possible to scrub through a video frame-by-frame, plus there is a setting to turn off auto-looping video playback in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> section of the Settings app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen using the Collections views in the ‌Photos‌ app, you can swipe right to go back to the previous view, plus the Favorites album now appears in the Utilities collection along with the Pinned Collections section.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou're also now able to clear Recently Viewed and Recently Shared album history.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Safari</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Safari section of the Settings app, there's a new \"Not Secure Connection Warning\" toggle that lets you know if you're visiting a website that does not have a valid SSL certificate for an encrypted connection. It is not advised to send passwords or other sensitive data on a site that pops up a \"Not Secure\" warning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/safari-ios-18-2-not-secure-warning.jpg\" width=\"2431\" height=\"1367\" />\r<br />\nApple's \"Not Secure Connection Warning\" toggle is not turned on by default. Apple says that HTTPS Priority will upgrade URLs to HTTPS whenever possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Settings app has a new section for managing website data and history, with options for Clear History and Website Data. The Website Data section includes options for exporting data from Safari and importing data from another app into Safari.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-safari-data.jpg\" width=\"1769\" height=\"995\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added new background images for customizing the Safari start page.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Safari Downloads</h2>\r<br />\nThe progress of Safari downloads can now be tracked on the ‌iPhone‌'s Lock Screen and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-18.2-Safari-Downloads-on-Lock-Screen-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Voice Memos</h2>\r<br />\nWith Voice Memos, two tracks can be layered on top of one another. There's also an option to separate layers and edit layer mixes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-layered-voice-memos.jpg\" width=\"5099\" height=\"2868\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwo-track projects can be imported directly into Logic Pro on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Find My</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> has a new option to Share Item Location with an \"airline or trusted person\" that can help you locate something that you've misplaced. Choosing the Share Item Location option creates a link that lets someone view the location of a lost item when they open the link.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-share-item-location.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe link can be opened on a non-Apple device, so an ‌iPhone‌ or Mac is not required to provide someone with your item's location. Links expire after a week or when you're reunited with your lost item.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also an option to Show Contact Info, which lets any phone or tablet connect to an item to view a website with more information about it, including the phone number and email address of the owner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Music</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> now supports natural language search. You can search for genres, moods, activity, decades, and more. Examples include \"songs about cats,\" \"songs with a vibe,\" \"relaxing songs,\" \"artists similar to Taylor Swift,\" \"sad 80s songs,\" and \"songs about food.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/ios-18-2-natural-language-search.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple Music‌ now displays the disc number in some albums.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple TV</h2>\r<br />\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app, you can also use casual language search terms to find exactly what you're looking for, typing in genres, actors, and moods. Searches like \"movies about natural disasters,\" \"movies with cats,\" \"movies with Zendaya,\" and \"exhilarating movies\" all bring up relevant results.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe navigation bar in the TV app can be customized, with options to add different apps and Library categories. Existing options like MLS and ‌Apple TV‌+ cannot be removed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-tv-app-edit-navigation-bar.jpg\" width=\"2064\" height=\"1160\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Podcasts</h2>\r<br />\nYou can favorite categories in the Podcasts app in iOS 18.2, and see categories in the library for a new way to navigate through shows and episodes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA new personalized search page in Podcasts suggests the most relevant categories and editorially curated collections tailored to your listening preferences.\r<br />\n<h2>Apple News+</h2>\r<br />\nFor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/\">Apple News</a>+ subscribers in the United States, iOS 18.2 adds daily sudoku puzzles. The sudoku puzzles join existing the Crossword, Crossword Mini, and Quartiles offerings. There are three difficulty levels to complete each day, including easy, moderate, and challenging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Sudoku-Apple-News-iOS-18.1-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Stocks</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Stocks app, there are now pre-market price quotes for tracking NASDAQ and NYSE tickers prior to when the market opens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPods Pro Hearing Test and Hearing Aid Expansion</h2>\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2 Hearing Test feature is now available in Cyprus, Czechia, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania, Spain, United Arab Emirates, and the UK.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Hearing Aid feature is available in the United Arab Emirates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Arcade</h2>\r<br />\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a> section of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, the \"All Games\" section has a new drop down filter menu and the option to turn off game previews.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-apple-arcade-categories.jpg\" width=\"2735\" height=\"1538\" />\r<br />\n<h2>EU App Changes</h2>\r<br />\nIn the European Union, users can now delete core apps that include the ‌App Store‌, Safari, Messages, Camera, and ‌Photos‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-delete-apps-eu.jpg\" width=\"2450\" height=\"1378\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/ios-18-2-eu-third-party-browser-web-apps/\">Third-party browser apps</a> in the EU will be able to create web apps for the ‌iPhone‌'s Home screen using their own custom engines when iOS 18.2 launches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 18.2 requires <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/eu-ipad-accessory-integration-feud/\">selecting a Default Browser</a> when opening Safari. This is a Digital Markets Act requirement, with Apple adding an updated interface that will let users select a default web browser of their choice from a list of options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already implemented this change in ‌iOS 18‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Default Apps Section</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Settings app under \"Apps,\" there's a new \"Default Apps\" section that can be used to manage your default apps for the ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-default-apps.jpg\" width=\"4470\" height=\"2514\" />\r<br />\nThere are Default App settings for Email, Messaging, Calling, Call Filtering, Browser App, Passwords and Codes, and Keyboards.

The update addresses an issue that could cause captured photos to not immediately appear in the All ‌Photos‌ grid.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt also fixes a bug that could cause Night mode photos to appear degraded when capturing long exposures, a problem that impacted the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Security Updates</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.2 addresses multiple security vulnerabilities, which means it's a good idea to update as soon as you can.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA full list of the vulnerabilities fixed can be <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121837\">found on Apple's website</a>, but it includes updates for the kernel, Passwords, Safari, WebKit, VoiceOver, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nFor more detail on the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features in iOS 18.2, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">we have a dedicated guide</a>.
