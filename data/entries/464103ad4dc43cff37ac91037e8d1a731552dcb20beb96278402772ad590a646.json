The provision seemed designed to deter scalping for a car expected to be available only in limited quantities after CEO Elon Musk's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/elon-musk-talks-tesla-we-dug-our-own-grave-with-the-cybertruck/\">statement</a> that Tesla \"dug our own grave with the Cybertruck.\"</p>\n<p>But the clause was deleted from Tesla's terms just days after people noticed its appearance. It was still in the Tesla <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/configurator/api/v3/terms?locale=en_US&amp;model=my&amp;saleType=Sale\">Motor Vehicle Order Agreement Terms &amp; Conditions</a> earlier today, but was removed from the document while we worked on this article. The document still has a more general rule against quick resales but without the lawsuit threat.</p>\n<p>Tesla may have decided to remove the clause after several news reports spread word of the change over the weekend. It's not clear whether the company will bring the clause back in a modified form. We contacted Tesla and will update this article if we get a response.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983454#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983454&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"464103ad4dc43cff37ac91037e8d1a731552dcb20beb96278402772ad590a646","category":"Tech"}
