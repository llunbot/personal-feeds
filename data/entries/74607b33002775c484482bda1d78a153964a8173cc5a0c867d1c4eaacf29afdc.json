The methane-fueled engines fired for about eight seconds, long enough for SpaceX engineers to verify all systems functioned normally. At full power, the 33 engines generated nearly 17 million pounds of thrust, twice the power output of NASA's iconic Saturn V Moon rocket.</p>\n<p>SpaceX confirmed the static fire test reached its full duration, and teams drained methane and liquid oxygen from the rocket, known as Booster 12 in the company's inventory of ships and boosters. The upper stage for the next Starship test flight, known as Ship 30, completed the static fire of its six Raptor engines in May.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037241#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037241&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"74607b33002775c484482bda1d78a153964a8173cc5a0c867d1c4eaacf29afdc","category":"Tech"}
