Every tube in the bike, except the head tube, was redesigned from the ground up, resulting in the lightest Strael model yet. Read on below for how the <a href=\"https://fairlightcycles.com/strael-4-0/?v=0b3b97fa6688\" target=\"_blank\">Strael 4.0</a> saved 280 grams over its predecessor.</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110388.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110388.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110388.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110388.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Strael 4.0 has been a massive project for Fairlight, with every tube – except the headtube – redesigned from scratch. Each tube required a completely new tooling, representing a substantial investment. The fork has also been completely redesigned – with a new mold opened.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15898.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15898.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15898.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15898.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-BB-15875.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-BB-15875.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-BB-15875.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-BB-15875.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15917.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15917.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15917.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-4-Monochrome-Dropout-15917.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, the cumulative weight savings are significant: the 54R (without bolts, axle, and inserts) now weighs 1.64 kg. For reference, the Strael 3.0 in the same size weighed 1.92 kg, saving a total of 280 g. The frame is ISO certified and passed all the fatigue tests on its first attempt.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110472.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110472.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110472.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110472.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110468.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110468.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110468.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110468.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>To achieve this, Fairlight collaborated with Reynolds Technology to create a new variation of 853 specifically designed for All-Road riding: Reynolds 853 Road DZB.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110474.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110474.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110474.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110474.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Despite the weight savings, the bike has moved into the All-Road category with clearance for 39 mm tires.

A brand new mold. New leg shape [combined with a new lay-up] to provide around 10% more compliance (in specific test conditions) vs the Anraed 3.0. The fork length remains at 381mm axle to crown. 140/160mm Flat mount. Tyre clearance to match the frame.</li>\n<li>New Reynolds 853 Road DZB tubing – specifically designed for All Road riding. Developed for Fairlight by Reynolds Technology. Adds strength and reduces weight.</li>\n<li>New chain stays and seat stays.</li>\n<li>Fairlight x Bentley Mk3 dropouts feature a removable cable stop – so whether you are using mechanical, Di2, or AXS gearing, the frame looks like it was designed specifically for the groupset. Direct mount, standard hanger and T-Type inserts.</li>\n<li>New 3D printed down tube cable guide – available in 1x and 2x versions. The brake hose now routes through the part for a more elegant aesthetic.</li>\n<li>All new 3D-printed bottom bracket cable guide for mechanical gear set-ups.</li>\n<li>Specific 3D printed bottom bracket guide for Di2 and AXS set-ups. Guides the brake hose and dynamo rear light wire.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fairlight_Strael_4_Geometry.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fairlight_Strael_4_Geometry.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fairlight_Strael_4_Geometry.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fairlight_Strael_4_Geometry.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<p>The geo underwent a few small refinements. The chainstay length has increased by 1mm (418mm to 419mm) to add space for the larger 700c tires. Head angles now match on Regular and Tall variants. Stack and Reach remain largely unchanged. BB drop increases by 4mm (6mm on 51R and 51T).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-Monochrome-L1110582.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-Monochrome-L1110582.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-Monochrome-L1110582.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-Monochrome-L1110582.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-STEALTH-L1110746.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-STEALTH-L1110746.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-STEALTH-L1110746.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-STEALTH-L1110746.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110490.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110490.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110490.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/FAIRLIGHT-2025-STRAEL-LS1-OCHRE-L1110490.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p><strong>US (minus shipping and taxes):</strong></p>\n<p>Frameset: £1245 – all colors.<br />\nBuilds from £2175 (105 12-speed mechanical).<br />\nAs always, loads of upgrade options are available, including dynamo lighting etc!</p>\n<p><strong>UK pricing (inv.
