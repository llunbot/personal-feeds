It's an electric crossover called the Solterra, and it has been developed in partnership with Toyota alongside that brand's forthcoming EV, the bZ4x.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the Solterra—or more accurately its core—you'll find a 71.4 kWh lithium-ion traction battery, between the axles and underneath the floor of the passenger compartment. It has been designed in both front- and all-wheel-drive variants, with either a 150 kW (201 hp) AC synchronous motor driving just the front wheels, or a pair of 80 kW (107 hp) motors, one powering each axle, for a total output of 160 kW (214 hp).</p>\n<p>Subaru says that the FWD Solterra has a range of 329 miles (530 km) and the AWD Solterra a range of about 285 miles (460 km). However, those range estimates were generated using the WLTP test standard, which does not accurately reflect the less-energy-efficient driving style required for North American roads.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812123#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812123&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
