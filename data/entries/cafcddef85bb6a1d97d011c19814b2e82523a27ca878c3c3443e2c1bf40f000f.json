I'm on my third week at Ars, and the space beat is as busy as ever. Going forward, Eric and I will alternate work on the Rocket Report every other week. SpaceX broke its own booster reuse record this week, and a Chinese company made history with the first methane-fueled rocket to achieve orbit. Back on Earth, Blue Origin blew up an engine that was supposed to fly on ULA's second Vulcan rocket.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png\" /></div>\n<p><strong>Zhuque-2 rocket makes history</strong>.

In its current form, the Zhuque-2 rocket can loft a payload of up to 1.5 metric tons into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953624#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953624&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cafcddef85bb6a1d97d011c19814b2e82523a27ca878c3c3443e2c1bf40f000f","category":"Tech"}
