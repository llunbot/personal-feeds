Beltrano served as a supervisor at the location, and he was selling the products that he swiped on Kijiji.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBetween September 2023 and January 2024, Beltrano deposited more than $232,000 in his bank accounts. He was fired by UPS on January 22, and arrested the same day. In his home and vehicle, investigators found $9,000 in cash, a Mac laptop, and jewelry valued at over $9,000.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeltrano admitted to stealing Apple products and jewelry from UPS, and said that he used the money to purchase a home worth $680,000 and to pay off a $60,000 Audi hatchback purchased in 2021. He has been charged with theft over $5,000, theft under $5,000, possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000, and possession of the proceeds of crime.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe theft was discovered after UPS launched an investigation in December to determine why so many Apple devices were disappearing from the warehouse in Winnipeg. Surveillance cameras were installed, and Beltrano was found to be stealing products from pallets that were supposed to be shipped to Ontario. He allegedly stole more 120 iPhones in a single shift in January 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsecutors have asked the court to approve the seizure of Beltrano's house, cash, bank accounts, and vehicle.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/ups-worker-apple-product-theft/\">UPS Worker Accused of Stealing and Reselling Apple Products Worth Over $1 Million</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ups-worker-accused-of-stealing-and-reselling-apple-products-worth-over-1-million.2422410/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c75a8f17ca3c6c4fdf162b532bea5dbf15a8cddc21b46b094e5c73f49a7cbb73","category":"Apple"}
