From now on, X says that Grok will direct users to Vote.gov when asked election-related questions.</p>\n<p>X, formerly Twitter, made the change about two weeks after five secretaries of state complained to the company. \"On August 21, 2024, X's Head of US and Canada Global Government Affairs informed the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State [Steve Simon] that the platform has made changes to its AI search assistant, Grok, after a request from several Secretaries of State,\" Simon's office said in a <a href=\"https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/secretaries-of-state-welcome-changes-to-x-s-ai-search-assistant/\">press release</a> yesterday.</p>\n<p>Grok is developed by xAI, one of Musk's other companies, and is available on X to paying subscribers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045662#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045662&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b35ff7c08d60874da78df898803fc3ac3a35722754025f478300c9d95147e61","category":"Tech"}
