That means Proton Mail for Windows and macOS maintains our commitment to security and privacy with several key features: zero-access encryption and end-to-end encryption, protection against trackers and phishing attempts, and our high-security account protection program, Proton Sentinel.</blockquote>Proton says the ability to use a separate app from a browser for accessing email and calendar also offers additional security benefits, such as protecting emails or events from rogue browser extensions and allowing automatic updates without relying on a browser.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app also includes an Easy Switch tool that enables users to import  messages from Outlook or Gmail, forward new messages from Gmail, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/proton-mail-desktop-app-blog-4-min.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" />\r<br />\nBesides these additions, the desktop app should be familiar to Proton users. \"Anyone who has used our web app before will instantly feel at home,\" says the company.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPaying Proton account holders can download the Proton Mail app from the <a href=\"https://proton.me/mail/download\">Proton website</a>, and the company is offering a 14-day trial for anyone on a free Proton plan. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/security/\">Security</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/\">Encryption</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/proton/\">Proton</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/proton-mail-desktop-app-available-mac/\">Proton Encrypted Mail Desktop App Now Available for Mac</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/proton-encrypted-mail-desktop-app-now-available-for-mac.2421901/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1e6865d50f22350e8a1bb057cb932f132a2f1d37709f6aa8f52878d1f3e1b503","category":"Apple"}
