{"title":"Reggie Jackson on Willie Mays’s Legacy, and the Abject Racism Faced by Black Baseball Players in the 1960s","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMH2z4lFvZw","date":1718993280000,"content":"\n<p>The whole 8-minute clip is excellent and worth your time, but do not miss the second half, starting with a sharp question from Alex Rodriguez <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GMH2z4lFvZw?si=4Kt78Mi_KwQ5Itda&amp;t=276\">at the 4:30 mark</a>. Reggie describes, in heartfelt detail, the abject racism he faced as a minor league player as recently as the 1960s. Restaurants he couldn’t eat at. Hotels he couldn’t stay at. Threats to burn to the ground the apartment building where he was sleeping. The pain, over five decades later, remains searing.</p>\n\n<p>Kudos to Fox Sports for airing this. We can’t celebrate progress without honestly facing society’s dark past. (Kudos too, for putting a box of Reggie Bars at the desk. Respect.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/21/reggie\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a45788846e700ee861782c741277484d0a605b6e2341861e49a6fc36df70c16d","category":"Tech"}
