In a US federal trial that started last week, Google is accused of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/is-googles-search-engine-smart-or-sneaky-a-trial-court-judge-will-decide/\">unlawfully monopolizing online search and search ads</a>. The company’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/our-approach/#:~:text=Google's%20mission%20is%20to%20organize,a%20wide%20variety%20of%20sources.\">self-defined mission</a> is to make the world's information universally accessible, yet Google successfully opposed livestreaming the trial and keeping the proceedings wholly open to the public. Enter Weitzman.</p>\n<p>The fresh law graduate is among a handful of legal or antitrust geeks trying to attend most, if not all, of the public portions of the trial, fearing a historic moment of tech giant accountability will escape public notice. Some have pushed off day jobs or moved near to the Washington, DC, courthouse. All are obsessively documenting their observations through social media and daily email newsletters.</p>\n<p>The trial is scheduled to run near-daily through November, and few news outlets can dedicate a reporter to a courtroom seat for eight hours a day for the duration. Most reporters focused on Google are based in San Francisco. Legal and regulatory publications that can commit charge hundreds of dollars for content subscriptions. Any antitrust junkie—or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-content-marketing-search/\">frustrated Google Search user</a>—wanting an affordable readout from the sparsely attended, era-defining trial, must rely on Weitzman, or a handful of others firing off tweets, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-is-fun/\">skeets</a>, and Substacks. “Regardless of your view on this trial and Big Tech, it will affect everyone, so it’s important that the public is aware of what’s going on as the trial unfolds and to record what happens,” Weitzman says.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970396#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970396&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f10efa0e0c942b0d8965bb406e3262018e3d13bfc1f26ea0f972a27448d0588d","category":"Tech"}
