It produces small amounts of electricity comparable to other energy-harvesting technologies, and it can also operate in water as well as air, according to the team's <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adma.202103142\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Advanced Materials. The team thinks the new NCSU device holds promise for powering wearable devices, charging them spontaneously with no need for an external power source.</p>\n<p>\"Mechanical energy—such as the kinetic energy of wind, waves, body movement and vibrations from motors—is abundant,\" <a href=\"https://news.ncsu.edu/2021/08/liquid-metal-energy-harvester/\">said co-author Michael Dickey</a>,  a chemical and bimolecular engineer at NCSU. “We have created a device that can turn this type of mechanical motion into electricity. And one of its remarkable attributes is that it works perfectly well underwater.”</p>\n<p>The NCSU scientists were particularly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2485\">a 2013 paper</a> by Korean researchers. The 2013 researchers found they could harvest energy from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-layer_capacitance\">electrical double-layer capacitor</a> (ELCD) by depressing arrays of water droplets sandwiched between two rigid electrodes, thereby spontaneously charging the capacitor. But the rigidity proved to be a shortcoming, since electricity was only generated by moving the stiff electrode up and down. Dickey and his co-authors wanted to create a flexible version of this technology.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791073#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791073&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"18e6b0485c296cdb8fd6f44758d9627b26ac672a823b71c77720a6e1a0edc3df","category":"Tech"}
