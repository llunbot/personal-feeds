That includes reaching beyond the current industry requirements for safety to offer bikes with industry-leading battery safety, quality, and certifications. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Safe Shield Battery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thermal-resistant technology has been designed from the ground up to advance the safety of eBike batteries. In addition, the new battery is available as both an external and semi-integrated 15Ah battery pack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tte battery packs are UL Certified to UL 2271. Further advancing current standards, the new battery packs are potted with a unique heat-absorbing resin that protects against corrosion and overheating. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down.jpeg\" alt=\"Rad Power Bikes Radster Trail and Road RadExpand folded down\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadExpand-folded-down-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal potting encapsulates each battery cell, and if overheating were to occur, the resin is designed to stop the thermal event from spreading. That spreading, or thermal runaway with intense heat is what makes battery fires so difficult to put out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rad Power says the internal potting can also prevent an accident, like a puncture, or significant collision, from escalating. into a full-on battery fire. Importantly, these batteries are also available for existing Rad Power ebikes that use their semi-integrated battery design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new battery packs are recyclable through RAD’s partnership with Redwood Materials and other qualified battery recycling programs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Safe Shield battery tech is available on the all-new Radster family, which consists of the Radster Trail, and Radster Road, and added to the fan favorites, the RadWagon 5, and RadExpand 5 Plus. All of the new eBikes have been UL Certified to UL 2849.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Safety Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other safety features of these new eBikes include hydraulic disc brakes to improve stopping power over prior models. The new eBikes have turn signals, brighter front headlights to enhance visibility, as well as revamped frame designs and torque sensors for more responsive rides. Plus, for all-weather eBiking the new bikes carry an IPX6 rating for water resistance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it.jpeg\" alt=\"Rad Power Bikes Radster Trail and Road RadWagon doin' it\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-RadWagon-doin-it-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Rad Riders wanted the option to move faster.

It builds on the heritage of Rad’s fan-favorite minivan alternative, but sports better handling, more comfort, and increased payload capacity. Rad condensed the frame and lowered its center of gravity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new geometry now accommodates a wider range of riders. It also comes with a suspension fork to smooth out the bumps. The RadWagon 5 is also getting updated accessories with a redesigned deck pad and running boards. It’s available in Black and Metallic Blue. Another huge change – the bike now rolls on 20 x 3.3″ Kenda tires instead of the proprietary 22″ fat bike tires that were made for them by Vee Tire Co. That means wider availability for replacements for tires and tubes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>RadExpand 5 Plus</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side-e1710867553555.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side-e1710867553555.jpeg\" alt=\"Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side-e1710867553555.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side-e1710867553555-297x162.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side-e1710867553555-800x436.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side-e1710867553555-120x65.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-blue-drive-side-e1710867553555-768x418.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan.jpeg\" alt=\"Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-front-side-tan-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan.jpeg\" alt=\"Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radster-Trail-and-Road-expand-back-side-tan-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to their users, Rad has added several highly requested features to the RadWxpand 5 Plus.
