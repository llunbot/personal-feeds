The new Specialized Roubaix comes close at a claimed 828g (including the front derailleur hanger and bottle cage rivnuts) and the Cannondale Synapse is heavier still at 950g, both in a size 56cm.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note claimed frame weights can vary in reality, so this isn’t an apples-for-apples comparison, but the point remains the Defy Advanced SL is a very light frame.</p>\n<p>Frame weights are also down for the Advanced Pro and Advanced frames at 860g, also in a size medium without hardware.</p>\n<p>Both the Defy Advanced SL and Defy Advanced Pro share the same fork, which sees a one-piece carbon construction. Giant is using its OverDrive 2 steerer, which is an oversized 1-1/4in to 1-1/4in D-shaped steerer tube.

Giant also says it believes such features typically come at a cost, be it increased weight, maintenance or decreased durability.</p>\n<p>The seatstays continue to be dropped and the chainstays asymmetric, with the non-driveside profiled to increase stability to counteract the drivetrain forces on the driveside. The seat tube is more slender at the seatpost junction and the head tube more svelte to improve aerodynamics, according to Giant.</p>\n<p>Giant has also increased the tyre clearance by 3mm to 38mm. This puts it in line with the Trek Domane and is greater than the 35mm clearance found on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-cannondale-synapse/\">Cannondale Synapse</a>. The new Specialized Roubaix, however, trumps the Defy at 40mm.</p>\n<p>All of the bikes ship with 32mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyres</a> that are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-set-up-a-tubeless-tyre/\">set up tubeless</a> as standard.</p>\n<h2>Familiar geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Defy Advanced SL in action\" title=\"Giant Defy Advanced MY24 - Defy Advanced SL action 1\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Giant says a ‘controlled’ ride was the aim with the new Defy Advanced SL.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<p>Giant says it paid particular attention to ensuring the new Defy’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">geometry</a> allows for a more controlled ride.</p>\n<p>To that end, the geometry is largely unchanged – head and seat tube angles are identical to the previous generation, along with the wheelbase, chainstay, fork rake, seat tube and top tube lengths.</p>\n<p>However, the head tube lengths have been reduced by 10mm on size-medium frames upwards. The reach is also a little longer and the stack shorter, with a size-medium frame clocking in at 379.8mm reach and 558mm stack, compared to 377mm and 567mm.</p>\n<p>As a result, Giant has made the Defy slightly more aggressive. This is apparently based on dealer and consumer feedback, with the stack a little too high on the previous generation. That said, and as you’d expect, the reach and stack are still higher than on the racey TCR.</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                    </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n<tr>\n                                                                                                                        <th>﻿</th><th><b>XS</b></th><th><b>S</b></th><th><b>M</b></th><th><b>ML</b></th><th><b>L</b></th><th><b>XL</b></th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td><b>Seat angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>74.5</td><td>74</td><td>73.5</td><td>73</td><td>73</td><td>73</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Head angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>70.5</td><td>71.75</td><td>72.5</td><td>72.5</td><td>72.5</td><td>72.5</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Chainstay</b> (mm)</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>420</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Seat tube</b> (mm)</td><td>410</td><td>445</td><td>480</td><td>515</td><td>535</td><td>565</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Top tube</b> (mm)</td><td>515</td><td>530</td><td>545</td><td>560</td><td>575</td><td>595</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Head tube</b> (mm)</td><td>120</td><td>140</td><td>150</td><td>175</td><td>195</td><td>215</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Fork offset</b> (mm)</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Trail</b> (mm)</td><td>71.6</td><td>63.4</td><td>58.6</td><td>58.6</td><td>58.6</td><td>58.6</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Bottom bracket drop</b> (mm)</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>70</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>995.2</td><td>994.4</td><td>997.7</td><td>1,010</td><td>1,025</td><td>1,040</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Standover</b> (mm)</td><td>705</td><td>733</td><td>762</td><td>796</td><td>814</td><td>841</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>527</td><td>541</td><td>558</td><td>577</td><td>596</td><td>615</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>368.9</td><td>374.9</td><td>379.8</td><td>383.7</td><td>392.9</td><td>402</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Handlebar width</b> (mm)</td><td>400</td><td>400</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>440</td><td>440</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Stem length</b> (mm)</td><td>80</td><td>90</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>110</td><td>110</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Crank length</b> (mm)</td><td>170</td><td>170</td><td>172.5</td><td>172.5</td><td>175</td><td>175</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Wheel size</b> (mm)</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td>        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n                    \n                                \n                \n    \n    \n</div>\n\n<h2>A shock D-Fusing seatpost and handlebar</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Defy Advanced MY24 -
