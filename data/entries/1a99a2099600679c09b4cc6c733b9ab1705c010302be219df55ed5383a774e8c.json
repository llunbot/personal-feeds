The only part of the bike that interacts with the road, the right tires can be the key to fulfilling your bike’s potential, allowing you to find comfort, control, and extra speed in the most challenging conditions you face. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the marketing machine of the bike industry loves to tout the latest advances in the wind tunnel and convince you that you need one more gear (again), road bike tires have truly undergone a renaissance over the past decade, bringing together a previously elusive balance of attributes in some magnificent offerings. We gathered 18 different models for side-by-side testing and comparison to help you find the right tires for your best rides yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you ride tubeless or clinchers, are looking for something for all conditions, the most puncture resistance, or a great value, our top recommendations are listed below followed by other worthy options in our best of the rest section.

clincher for a decade. While it was no doubt challenging to improve on the 4000 S II, the ride quality of the 5000 represents a massive step forward for the Grand Prix model. </p><p></p><p>The new <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcontinental-grand-prix-5000-tire-clincher\">Grand Prix 5000 Clincher</a> features updated versions of the <em>Black Chili</em> tread compound and tear-resistant <em>Vectran Breaker</em> technology, which have long been hallmarks of the Grand Prix and other Continental tires. What is new are <em>Lazer Grip</em> and <em>Active Comfort</em> technologies. Lazer grip is a “lasered micro profile structure that expands over the tire’s shoulder and provides outstanding cornering”, according to Continental. Active comfort is “embedded in the tire construction…and absorbs vibrations and smoothens your ride”. While it’s hard to say if the 5000 has more grip than the 4000 S II, the difference in comfort between the old and the new is more readily apparent. </p><p></p><p>The biggest criticism of the GP 4000 S II was that it was a stiff tire that didn’t conform well to road imperfections or cope well with the lateral forces of high-speed maneuvers. Many of the folks who spoke about this were big fans of Vittoria Corsa Evo and were willing to accept the Corsa’s weaker puncture protection in exchange for a fast more supple ride quality. While the “stiff” label given to the 4000 S II may have been unfair given the silly high tire pressures being espoused as recently as 10 years ago, it seems Continental was listening, as it is now undeniable that the new Grand Prix 5000 is a supple tire. It absolutely sings over weathered pavement, especially when descending at speed, throwing the bike side to side. It also has a nice sizzle when climbing out the saddle to accelerate, encouraging you to punch the pedals and rock the bike side-to-side. It’s just a fun tire to rip around on. </p><p></p><p>The <em>Vectran Breaker</em> also has been updated to be lighter, more flexible, and protect better against cuts than previous models. Vectran is a strong and lightweight synthetic woven material. It has always been great at preventing punctures and is now even better while also allowing the GP 5000 to ride and behave as described above and helping to create a magical combination of worry-free <em>and</em> super-fun riding. They come in multiple flavors of “tanwall” and both look great.

First, it’s lighter than other Vittoria tires which cost almost double. While weight isn’t everything, saving mass on the outermost edge of the wheel will always help a bike be a bit more efficient. Second, the Rubino measures out bigger than its labeled size and thereby allows more weight savings by sizing down, without any loss of grip or comfort. Third, the Rubino Pro rides better than its 150 TPI and $55 price would suggest. </p><p></p><p>After unboxing a number of tubeless-ready road tires throughout this test, the Rubino was a surprise, because of its relatively low weight. Aesthetically, it’s a bit rough, with an odd hue of grayish-tan sidewall that has a somewhat irregular border. A serpentine tread pattern also catches the eye and appears to be designed to help channel water away from the contact patch. Molded in large letters on the sidewall is a reminder that the Rubino is for hooked rims only. In other words, it’s a clincher tire. </p><p></p><p>We value our time as well as money, so after setting these clincher tires up in 5 minutes without any thought or effort, the value of this $55 tire went up a little bit more. The tire was easy to stretch onto the rims by hand and seated perfectly by 50 psi. At 70 PSI, the 28c Rubino Pro looked larger than expected, and this was confirmed with calipers, which measured it at 30.81mm on a 21mm-internal rim. That’s big enough that for paved road riding, we wouldn’t recommend going bigger than 28c, and more likely 25c, to ensure the tire clears your frame and doesn’t change the front-end handling. </p><p></p><p>We didn’t notice anything remarkable about the Rubino Pro during our test. That’s perhaps the best compliment you can pay to a tire that is designed to carry you through long training rides in less-than-ideal weather and last a long time. The Rubino’s did such an excellent job of tossing away debris that they required less thought about line choice and road conditions, and there was rarely anything embedded in the G2.0 Graphene-infused tread throughout testing. Graphene is a nice technology in a tire that costs just $55 (or a lot less if you know where to look) as it allows a tire to be tough enough to fend off debris while remaining supple enough that it’s comfortable and confident to maneuver. </p><p></p><p>If you want to ride in equal parts comfort, control, and convenience, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-rubino-pro-g2.0-tire-clincher\">Vittoria Rubino Pro</a> is a winning choice.

The Hell of the North is an appropriate nickname for what can be the most grueling road race on the Pro Tour calendar – Paris Roubaix, held each April on the cobbled farm roads of Northern France. If you want to see grown men openly weep, this is a great place to be, and there’s a good chance that the tears you see will be born of frustration from yet another punctured tire. So severe are the roads that the difference between winning and never contending comes down to a tire’s ability to prevent punctures. This is precisely why the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-turbo-cotton-hell-of-the-north-tire-clincher\">Turbo Cotton Hell of the North</a> now features bolstered puncture protection in what has long been one of the fastest and best-riding clincher tires available. </p><p></p><p>Many riders have had a love/hate relationship with Specialized tires over the years. Their gravel and all-road tires have been excellent – fast enough, and durable as all get out. As for road tires, the Turbo Cotton’s performance was always amazing, but riding them on less-than-perfect roads was tough because they tended to puncture easily. Enter the Turbo Cotton Hell of the North.</p><p></p><p>Specialized Turbo Cotton tires – including the Hell of the North – use an “open tubular” construction, meaning they are constructed by bonding the tread – a compound that Specialized calls Gripton® to a flat, or “open” cotton carcass. This type of construction lends a supple, smooth ride that mimics old-school tubular tires that are glued onto the rim. Combine this type of tire with a lightweight innertube and the ride is dreamy. The tire hums along smoothly in a straight line and over bumps in the road, and also conforms precisely to the pavement during maneuvers, providing confidence through feedback and grip. </p><p></p><p>Thankfully, the added puncture protection, dubbed BlackBelt®, doesn’t noticeably disturb the buttery Turbo Cotton feel. BlackBelt does add a few grams compared to the standard Turbo Cotton, but if you’re interested in riding a 28c tire (the only size available in the Hell of the North tread) the added weight shouldn’t be a concern. Since the Hell of the North is a 28c, it can change the handling of very aggressive race bikes a little bit. It’s something you get used to after a few minutes of riding, but the general effect on race bikes is that the steering slows down slightly, and you feel a bit higher off the ground than with a 23 or 25c tire. To ensure that you’re taking advantage of the extra volume in the Hell of the North, it’s important to run them at the lowest pressure you’re comfortable with, factoring in your weight and how responsive you want the handling to be. Bigger riders who want instantaneous changes in direction may want around 80-90 PSI, while smaller riders looking to maximize straight-line rolling efficiency might go as low as 55 PSI.

With so few options officially compatible, it made a lot of sense for ENVE to develop a tire that would complement their rims. To be more transparent, ENVE partnered with a well-established tire manufacturer, Tufo, to produce this road tire with a rather unsurprising name – the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219798%2Fenve-ses-road-tire\">SES (Smart Enve System)</a>. </p><p></p><p>It’s also no shock that ENVE claims that the SES tire saves watts of drag thanks to an aerodynamically optimized tread pattern. The tread pattern is a random-looking series of grooves that are actually segments of deconstructed letters from ENVE’s logo. This pattern is purported to create beneficial air turbulence across the tread surface and thereby save a few watts. If I didn’t know the bike industry better, I’d say that you can’t make this stuff up…</p><p></p><p>Out of the box, the ENVE SES fits right in with the rest of ENVE’s products, with minimal branding and a race-inspired appearance. For a 29c tire, they felt light, and that was confirmed after weighing them at 273g, which is relatively light for a tubeless tire of this size. The artificial, peanut-buttery look of the tan sidewalls was a bit off-putting at first, but not to worry, as ENVE assures us that this color will darken over time to look more natural and classic. </p><p></p><p>Setting up the SES tires tubeless on a hooked tubeless rim, installation was relatively easy, with the tire stretching into the rim bed with bare hands and a small measure of elbow grease. The beads popped into place with a floor pump while the core was removed from the tubeless valve. After adding sealant, reinstalling the valve core, and reinflating the tires, they immediately held 60psi overnight. While it can occasionally be more challenging to seal certain tire and rim combinations, the SES were genuinely easy to get rolling. </p><p></p><p>While it can be hard to quantify watt savings from a tire’s tread pattern, the SES tires feel rapid as all get out. The SES are vulcanized, a construction method that in many cases leads to a muted, vague, and even sluggish ride experience in some cases. Not so for the SES, which feels like it wants to gather energy from every little ripple and bump it rolls over. It’s a nice feeling, not buzzy or harsh, but dropping the pressure down a bit just to quiet the feedback made them feel even better, and at 55 PSI, the 29c SES felt perfect. Reactive to accelerations and quick changes of direction, but plush and stable when pinning it through a flat section. On climbs, the extra mass could be felt a little bit, but it never felt like power was being wasted to keep them turning against gravity. Going down descents, they communicate their grip well, which made for confident cornering. </p><p></p><p>Before the test, I honestly had reservations about a tire developed by a company that specializes in exotic carbon fiber parts and aerodynamics. I thought that the SES might be a bit too delicate for the real world. To my pleasant surprise, the opposite proved true, as I experienced zero punctures during my test period, thanks to a Vectran protection layer in the tread. The SES also held air pressure well between rides, which speaks to the precise tolerances required for it to be hookless-ready. </p><p></p><p>What still sticks out, and why these tires are still the test bike, is how well the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219798%2Fenve-ses-road-tire\">ENVE SES</a> rides. If you are riding hookless rims and need a hookless-ready tire that approaches the ride quality of your old cotton sidewall clinchers, these should fit the bill. They will also work with any clincher rim and innertube, or “tubeless-ready” rim. The SES tire is also reasonably priced, for something that has “ENVE” printed on it, at just $75.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219798%2Fenve-ses-road-tire\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=16813&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enve.com%2Fproduct%2Fses-road-tire%2F\">Check Price at ENVE</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1.jpeg\" alt=\"The ENVE SES road bike tires mounted on a test bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ENVE-SES-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>ENVE’s SES hookless tubeless tires look right at home on a high-end titanium frame.

So, if you decide to pick up the Strada Pro TLR tires, be sure to confirm that your rims are, in fact, hooked. Hookless rims are becoming more prevalent, from brands like ENVE, ZIPP, and GIANT, so it will be interesting to see if Challenge eventually develops a hookless-ready tire, but for now, those of you running tubeless-ready rims can still enjoy the excellent ride quality of Challenge TLR tires.</p><p></p><p>To be polite, setting up the Strada Pro was a bit, well, challenging. Because the tires are so supple, it seems that they are intentionally made a bit undersized, with the assumption that they will stretch over time, thus becoming easier to remove and remount if needed. It’s crucial if you are setting these up tubeless that you install the tubeless valve first, as it will be impossible to position it once you have the first bead stretched over the rim. Getting even one side of the tire stretched onto the rim required the use of a tire lever. Thankfully, there is just enough stretch in the sidewalls to get the tires over the rim, although we have concerns about this tire’s ability to be removed and set up tubeless after that. I suspect and have some forum-sourced evidence to confirm that the bead does indeed stretch, and after that isn’t uniform enough to reliably seal in air at high pressure. </p><p></p><p>Alas, it was time to ride these beautiful tires. They are certainly bold-looking on the bike, with bright yellow sidewalls. The sidewalls do develop a dark, rich patina over time and eventually look very sexy. More importantly, the profile of the tire is gorgeously rounded atop the rim. I was amazed that I could get this much tire underneath my rim brakes and carbon fork crown with safe clearance. This is possible because the Strada Pro TLR’s width is equal to its height, so there is no “lightbulb” effect that compromises tire clearance. </p><p></p><p>Inflated to 65 PSI, the Strada Pro were brilliant, reproducing the same supple ride quality and exhilarating handling characteristics of the Challenge open clincher tires tried over the years. At high speed, the Strada Pro gives a nice sensation of being suspended just enough to be supremely comfortable, without losing any of the feedback needed to maneuver the bike. The tread, which features a puncture protection layer beneath the chevroned surface, is thick enough that potholes, cracks, and bumps in the pavement don’t upset the ride much at all. </p><p></p><p>If you want the feel of an open tubular clincher tire along with the puncture-sealing properties of a tubeless system and don’t mind using a bit of elbow grease during installation, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F218149%2Fchallenge-strada-pro-tubeless-tire\">Challenge Strada Pro TLR</a> is an excellent choice for your next road tire.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F218149%2Fchallenge-strada-pro-tubeless-tire\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KDRNSTD/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR.jpeg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Challenge-Strada-Pro-TLR-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Challenge Strad Pro TLR tires have a distinctive chevroned tread design and a super supple ride quality.

It’s not light at 333g, but that doesn’t matter, because once it’s rolling, it holds speed incredibly well over any type of pavement, from minty fresh tarmac to weathered and bumpy country lanes. </p><p></p><p>Setting up the Pro One Addix TLE was super easy, as promised by the “TLE” or “tubeless-easy” label on the sidewall. The bead popped into place with a few strokes of a floor pump, with the valve core removed. The fitment was so precise that you could watch the bead slotting into the rim hook with each stroke of the pump. After the bead was in place and the addition of sealant, reinstallation of the valve core, and inflation to 50 PSI, it was time to go find some rough country roads and see how this all-road tire performed. </p><p></p><p>The Addix tread compound has a nice blend of flex and puncture protection. The sidewalls are somewhat rigid, as can be expected from a tubeless-ready tire, but at low pressure, they feel fast and lively.  After a few rides, the Pro One Addix felt grippier and faster rolling, because some of the preservative coating wore off. Over time, the Pro One TLE proved to be so effective at isolating the bike and rider from all the buzz and small bumps that add up to increased fatigue, that it encouraged staying out on the bike for longer and longer rides. </p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a 4-season tire that will noticeably improve the ride quality of your bike, and need a very easy home tubeless experience, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F211353%2Fschwalbe-pro-one-tle-tire\">Schwalbe Pro One TLE 30c</a> tire is a clear-cut winner.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F211353%2Fschwalbe-pro-one-tle-tire\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WPV58SC/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One TLE road bike tires mounted on a test bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Schwalbe-Pro-One-TLE-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Schwalbe Pro One TLE stands out for ease of tubeless setup, plus they look good and perform well on the road.

This tire has been around for decades and continues to sell because it works as advertised, protecting you from annoying and dangerous punctures on the nastiest roads out there. As the name implies, the Gatorskin is capable of withstanding tremendous abuse though that comes with a weight penalty and at the sacrifice of suppleness.</p><p></p><p>Continental achieved this rugged reliability by including PolyX Breaker®, a polyester layer originally developed for application in automobile tires. The Polyester fiber is tightly cross-woven into an extremely dense barrier against road debris. Even if debris becomes embedded in the tread, PolyX Breaker is still quite effective at preventing a puncture until the debris can be removed. Considering how well the tread of the Gatorskin resists punctures, it also rides reasonably well. In size 28c on a shallow, wide rim, the profile helped create a smooth ride and handling that is confident enough for recreational rides. Given the stiffer carcass and firmer rubber, however, a more cautious approach to descending in the wet is needed, as they simply don’t conform to the ground well enough to transmit the level of feedback to push it in that situation. </p><p></p><p>Setting up the Gatorskin was a breeze, as is the case with all Continental clincher tires. While tubeless tires are gaining popularity, in part for their ability to seal some punctures as you ride, there is still merit to the idea of a tire that can be easily removed and reinstalled with a fresh tube in the unlikely event of a puncture. Not to mention you won’t be spraying sealant everywhere when even a tiny piece of debris lodges into the tread. </p><p>Equally important is the durability of the sidewall, as tears in this part of the tire tend to be more problematic and can require more drastic measures in order to get the bike back on the road. Continental’s DuraSkin® sidewall protection is there to ensure complete protection from the worst road debris, by incorporating a high-quality polyamide fabric to ward off tears and cuts. </p><p></p><p>If your route options require you to ride on roads that are littered with debris, or you just want to avoid punctures while making some concessions in ride quality, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F886505%2Fcontinental-gatorskin-tire\">Gatorskin from Continental</a> will take great care of you, letting you ride out into the worst of the worst to get your training or daily rides done, week after week, with peace of mind.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F886505%2Fcontinental-gatorskin-tire\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0881V5V7Z/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Continental gatorskin road bike tires mounted to a test rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Continental-Gatorskin-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With great puncture resistance and a respectable weight, there’s a reason the Continental Gatorskin is our pick for riding rough and/or debris-covered roads.

While weight isn’t everything, it does hamper acceleration from low speed and adds ever so slightly to rolling resistance. So, when looking up the specs on the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpanaracer-panaracer-agilest-tlr-tire\">Panaracer Agilest TLR</a> prior to receiving them, we did a double take seeing the weight of a 28c was only 250g, just 40g more than the clincher. When they arrived, weighing them on our scale confirmed that this number was spot on.</p><p></p><p>Setting up the Agilest was also very easy. It stretched onto the rim more easily than most tires that are not only tubeless-ready but also hookless-ready. Once the tire was mounted, it inflated and seated easily using a floor pump with the valve core removed. After confirming that the bead was snapped into place, adding sealant, replacing the valve core, and inflating the 28c tire to 75 psi, it was time to ride. </p><p></p><p>Right away, the lack of extra mass in the Agilest was apparent, and it feels more akin to riding a tubular, with a nice supple ride and grippy cornering. Panaracer uses a compound called Zero Slip Grip (ZSG) that is designed to balance grip, low weight, and puncture resistance. All three of those objectives are achieved and then some.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, the Agilest TLR lends a nice bit of agility to the bike, biting hard into the pavement during quick maneuvers and responding quickly to accelerations, even on damp roads. Several attempts to break traction on the rear tire during a steep climb were unsuccessful, confirming that Panaracer nailed it with the ZSG compound. At speed, the Agilest TLR glides smoothly, soaking up rougher sections of pavement with ease. </p><p></p><p>With zero punctures during the test period and minimal debris embedding in the tread, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpanaracer-panaracer-agilest-tlr-tire\">Panaracer Agilest TLR</a> proved to be surprisingly durable for such a smooth-riding and lightweight tire. The Agilest is a very nicely balanced offering, providing durability, low weight, and excellent ride quality. If you want a tubeless tire that is compatible with any rim out there, and can transition from training to racing, the Agilest TLR will not disappoint.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpanaracer-panaracer-agilest-tlr-tire\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1Y6QP6Q/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tAnother Great Value\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSpecialized-Turbo-Pro-T5-700C-Tire%3FqueryID%3D46db10560b3164f6e789c3e6fc4230be\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpecialized Turbo Pro T5\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$55 US</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>291g (700 x 30c)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Size tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>700 x 30c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>24c, 26c, 28c, 30c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>TPI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>60</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tire Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher, Tubeless-Ready (w/ tube)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSpecialized-Turbo-Pro-T5-700C-Tire%3FqueryID%3D46db10560b3164f6e789c3e6fc4230be\">\n\n<img width=\"735\" height=\"490\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Turbo-Pro.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Turbo-Pro.jpeg 735w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Turbo-Pro-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Turbo-Pro-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Turbo-Pro-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Durable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smooth rolling</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Confident handling</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavy-ish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSpecialized-Turbo-Pro-T5-700C-Tire%3FqueryID%3D46db10560b3164f6e789c3e6fc4230be\">Specialized Turbo Pro T5</a> is a clincher that occupies a nice place, between an outright training tire like the Continental Gatorskin and an open tubular like the S-Works Turbo. This means that the Turbo Pro T5 is a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none. It’s durable and resists punctures well, with an updated BlackBelt® tread, but will still pick up debris on nasty roads and doesn’t have any upgraded sidewall protection over its more supple S-Works sibling. On the bright side, it competes well with more expensive, higher TPI tires on ride quality and handling, but doesn’t have quite the same type of hum to it. </p><p></p><p>The Turbo T5 is also respectably light for such a robust tire in 30c. Mounting was very easy and the tires snapped into the bead hook confidently with a nice loud popping sound. </p><p></p><p>I enjoyed riding the Turbo Pro T5 30c at 75 PSI in wet conditions. The stout construction of the Turbo Pro responds well to the lower tire pressures that are preferable when riding on damp roads. The Gripton® compound works very well, with little dimples that enhance feedback just enough to add some confidence on slippery pavement. Thanks to the BlackBelt® puncture protection layer, we had zero flats to report during the test period, and the tires looked virtually new after a couple hundred miles on quiet country roads. </p><p></p><p>Specialized has changed the size of the Turbo Pro, and now offers  24, 26, 28, and 30c sizes instead of the 22, 24, 26, and 28c of the previous generation. While the labeled sizes are larger, Specialized had to actually shrink the tire in each size to fall in line with new ETRTO standards. So, for example, the 30-622 size is now the same size as the 28-622 size of the previous Turbo. Thankfully, since rim width has increased a great deal recently, it might not affect the actual mounted size. But, if you’re installing these on older, narrower rims, be sure to check the size so you’re not surprised that they are smaller than expected. </p><p></p><p>If you need one clincher tire to ride year-round and want to keep the weight respectable while taking advantage of proven Gripton® and Blackbelt® technology, the affordable <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSpecialized-Turbo-Pro-T5-700C-Tire%3FqueryID%3D46db10560b3164f6e789c3e6fc4230be\">Specialized Turbo Pro T5 </a>makes a lot of sense. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSpecialized-Turbo-Pro-T5-700C-Tire%3FqueryID%3D46db10560b3164f6e789c3e6fc4230be\">Check Price at Jenson USA</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F225311%2Fvittoria-corsa-next-clincher-tire\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVittoria Corsa N.EXT Clincher\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>293g (700 x 32c)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Size Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>700 x 32c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>24c, 28c, 30c, 32c, 34c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>TPI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>300</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tire Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher, Tubeless Ready (with tubes)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F225311%2Fvittoria-corsa-next-clincher-tire\">\n\n<img width=\"942\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-N.EXT-Clincher.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-N.EXT-Clincher.jpeg 942w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-N.EXT-Clincher-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-N.EXT-Clincher-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-N.EXT-Clincher-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-N.EXT-Clincher-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-N.EXT-Clincher-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonable weight for size</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Low rolling resistance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Supple ride quality</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to puncture</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>32c measured smaller than advertised</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F225311%2Fvittoria-corsa-next-clincher-tire\">Vittoria’s Corsa N.EXT</a> clincher tire brings polyester casing to the Corsa lineup, which until now used cotton casings to achieve an astonishingly supple ride quality that was beloved by cyclists around the globe. Vittoria claims that the Corsa N.EXT clincher is more durable than previous iterations of the Corsa while retaining its ride quality and low weight. </p><p></p><p>Out of the box, the Corsa N.EXT clincher looked noticeably smaller in profile than its 32c labeled size would suggest. Measured with calipers at 75 psi, the Corsa N.EXT clincher was actually 31.4mm which is smaller than advertised, but closer than they look. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the Corsa N.EXT does have a nice ride quality, although it does not match its predecessor in this regard. Somewhat sadly, I would say that the entire range of Vittoria Corsa tires has made some concessions to ride quality in exchange for increased compatibility and perhaps a less labor-intensive production process. That said, they are still among the best clinchers and tubeless-ready tires out there. The Corsa N.EXT was responsive to maneuvering and accelerations and provided excellent grip on wet, weathered roads.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, while testing, we experienced a couple punctures using the Corsa N.EXT. It’s entirely possible that it was a horrible run of bad luck, but a quick review of internet reviews from customers who purchased the Corsa N.EXT supported the conclusion that they are just not very puncture-resistant. </p><p></p><p>The niche of the Corsa N.EXT is that it is available as a clincher that is respectably light for its size. The two other Corsa tires, including the Corsa Pro and the Corsa Pro Control, are both only available as tubeless-ready tires and are comparatively heavy. So, for weight-conscious riders who ride on clean roads and don’t mind a slightly undersized tire, the <a

Prix 5000 S TR</a> is touted as being the best road tire Continental has ever developed. While it does meet an important benchmark of being compatible with the latest trend of hookless rims for tubeless tires and sheds 50 grams over its predecessor, the actual experience of riding the GP 5000 S TR – although quite good – didn’t quite live up to this “best ever” billing. </p><p></p><p>While I didn’t find the GP 5000 S TR to be particularly remarkable in any sense, it was also hard to find a single fault in its performance. For a tubeless-ready road tire, it’s fairly light at 287g in black 28c, and yet we experienced no punctures during the test period. The cornering grip was ample at various pressures between 65 and 90 psi. The GP 5000 S TR felt efficient at higher speeds, even if it didn’t match the “match-strike” feeling of its clincher counterpart, the GP 5000, during uphill accelerations. The GP 5000 S TR also didn’t feel the most supple, compared to some of its competitors, but was certainly cushier than a true training tire. After riding the GP 5000 S TR on a test bike, it wasn’t surprising to learn that it’s a 220 TPI tire. While that’s a respectable number, it’s certainly fewer threads per inch than many high-end race tires and those in a similar price range. </p><p></p><p>Impressively, the GP 5000 S TR shed 50g from its previous iteration, thanks to the removal of an unnecessary inner liner, giving it a much more respectable weight (though still 50g heavier than the clincher version).

Pirelli’s aim with the PZero TLR 4S is to be a year-round tire that is tough enough for winter training but also fast enough for racing or fast group rides. Though we didn’t have a full season to test the PZERO TLR 4S, we were interested to see how well these disparate goals could both be accomplished in one tire. </p><p></p><p>Out of the box, the heft of the P ZERO TLR 4S was obvious with a weight of 380g in size 30c, but so was the construction quality, which was no surprise as Pirelli’s reputation precedes any product bearing the name. </p><p></p><p>Both tires mounted easily with a floor pump with the valve core removed. After adding sealant, and inflating to 60 PSI, a hilly test ride was chosen to throw down some watts and get a sense of how the PZERO TLR 4S would perform in a race or fast group ride scenario. </p><p></p><p>In the flats and downhill, the ride of the PZERO TLR 4S was buttery smooth and the bike felt rapid. While climbing, the tires have a more subdued feel, like they want to settle into a steady rhythm, rather than surge uphill. On a couple of rough and steep sections with muck covering the road, the grip and stability at the contact patch were quite impressive. This grip is made possible by a Silica-based tread compound called SmartNet™, which, according to Pirelli, “features microscopic rod-shaped particles, that are arranged systematically, rather than chaotically” and that “the wide surface of the silica rod molecules enhances its natural water affinity, delivering confident handling in wet conditions.”</p><p></p><p>The grippyness continued to impress throughout the test period. If racing or riding an especially hilly course, a smaller size (and lighter weight) of the TLR 4S would be a good choice, because the extra mass can definitely be felt at all times. We also had the chance to test the P Zero TLR (non-4S) version of this tire, and while their on-road performance seemed indistinguishable to us, that tire weighs 21g less at 359g in the same size (but heavier than the claimed weight of 315g).</p><p></p><p>Throughout the rest of the test period, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHDP5WSJ/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Pirelli P ZERO Race TLR 4S</a> performed impressively and without issue. I agree with Pirelli that the design of this tire achieves the objectives of both speed and durability and can be a year-round option assuming you’re willing to take the weight penalty in trade for durability. So, if your riding tends to be flat, or the climbs are very gradual, and you want a burly casing that still offers a nice ride quality, the PZERO TLR 4S might be the best choice for you.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHDP5WSJ/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3HZHSCX/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPanaracer Agilest Clincher\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$57</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>210g (700 x 28c Black/Tan)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Size Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>28c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>23c, 25c, 28c, 30c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>TPI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>120</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tire Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher, Tubeless Ready (with tube)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3HZHSCX/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">\n\n<img width=\"1584\" height=\"1056\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher.jpeg 1584w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Panaracer-Agilest-Clincher-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent response and grip</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>None</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3HZHSCX/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Panaracer Agilest Clincher</a> offers a balance of attributes that would have been impossible a decade ago. It is light, it is durable, and it rides like an open tubular, but is more affordable thanks to a more efficient construction process. Our test 700 x 28c Agilests weighed in exactly at the claimed weight of 210g. To put that in context, multiple 28c clincher tires in this test were upwards of 25% heavier. Weight isn’t everything in a tire, but it’s not nothing, either. Each pedal stroke of your bike creates a very, very small acceleration, and having unnecessary mass on the outer edge of the wheels can hamper your ability to go faster, or conserve energy to go the same speed. There’s actually a word for that..watts, you may have heard it before. </p><p></p><p>These tires are handmade in Japan, which ostensibly means that they are built to very rigorous standards. The construction of the Agilest is vulcanized, but thanks to Panaracer’s own ZSG (Zero Slip Grip) compound, they can compete on ride quality with handmade open tubular clincher tires. Once mounted, the Agilest takes on a beautifully rounded profile that compliments the wider rims that are prevalent today. </p><p></p><p>Much like the tubeless version, the Agilest TLR, and as the name suggests, the Agilest lends a nice bit of agility to the bike. These tires respond well to accelerations and quick maneuvers, even in damp conditions. Attempts to break traction on a steep climb proved unsuccessful and showed that there’s something to Panaracer’s Zero Slip Grip compound. At the same time, the Agilist Clincher rolls smoothly and fast while handling rougher sections of pavement with confidence.</p><p></p><p>Despite the super lightweight of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3HZHSCX/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Agilest Clincher</a>, we were surprised by how little debris they picked up while riding and experienced no punctures during testing. On top of that, they’re also quite affordable with a retail price of just $57, showing you don’t have to spend a lot for a lightweight clincher with excellent ride quality. If you’re looking to lighten up your ride to attack the climbs and have the grip to descend aggressively, the Agilest Clincher should be in your sights.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3HZHSCX/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-pro-control-g2.0-tubeless-tire\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVittoria Corsa Pro Control TLR\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$100</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>324g (700 x 28c Black/Tan)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sizes Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>700 x 28c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>26c, 28c, 30c, 32c, 34c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>TPI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>320</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tire Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tubeless</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tubeless-Ready, Hookless Tubeless, Clincher (with tube)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-pro-control-g2.0-tubeless-tire\">\n\n<img width=\"2268\" height=\"1512\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR.jpeg 2268w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-TLR-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smooth ride</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy tubeless setup</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavier weight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-pro-control-g2.0-tubeless-tire\">Vittoria Corsa Pro Control</a> retains most of the attributes that have made the Corsa racing tire a long-running favorite of many riders but features bolstered durability and confidence on nastier road surfaces. Having ridden the clincher version of the Corsa Control extensively, we were keen to see how the tubeless-ready version compared. We set these tires up tubeless on a 21mm-wide hooked, tubeless-ready rim and tested them for several rides on the most varied paved surfaces possible. </p><p></p><p>Unboxing the Corsa Pro Control, their weight was immediately noticeable. There are heavier tires, but 324g is a tad portly for a road tire, there’s no getting around it. The quality is readily apparent too, though, and that’s no surprise, as Vittoria has made some of the finest road tires for many decades now. Tire pressure limits and rim compatibility are clearly printed on the sidewall of the Corsa Pro Control. This leaves no doubt about max pressures and lets users know that these can be run with not only clincher but also both types of tubeless rims, hooked “tubeless-ready” and hookless tubeless.</p><p></p><p>The Corsa Pro Control set up quickly on a tubeless-ready rim using just a regular floor pump, with the valve core removed. Interestingly, there was no sudden popping noise when the bead was seated, so visual confirmation was needed to ensure that the tire was evenly seated around the circumference of both sides. It took numerous inflations before they held air overnight, but that’s just a reality of many road tubeless tire and rim combinations.</p><p></p><p>Being big fans of the original Corsa Control clincher tires, we were eager to see how the tubeless Corsa Pro Control compared, particularly the ride feel, given that the cotton casing is now bonded seamlessly to the tread. While the ride quality of the previous generation clincher-only Corsa Control was similar to a tubular tire, the new Corsa Pro Control lacks that pleasant, tubular-like feedback of the original. Instead, it feels stable and stout and normalizes how the road and the bike feel beneath you. This is likely a necessary tradeoff for the seamless construction of the tire, which, we expect should prevent the delamination of the tread from the casing, which was a bugaboo of the previous Corsa generations. </p><p></p><p>The new Corsa Pro Control also doesn’t feel as quick as its predecessor, most notably on climbs. Its 324-gram weight is about 45 grams heavier than the Corsa Control clincher in 28c, nearly a 15% increase, which is impossible not to notice when fighting against gravity. Handling is confident and grip is excellent, but again, due to the tubeless-ready construction of the tubeless Corsa Pro Control, it feels a bit stiffer and gives less feedback during maneuvers than its clincher predecessor. The use of Graphene in the tread has bolstered the puncture resistance of all high-end Vittoria tires in recent years, and we had zero punctures during the test period, which included riding on some notoriously sketchy roads.  </p><p></p><p>If you are riding hookless rims, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-pro-control-g2.0-tubeless-tire\">Vittoria Corsa Pro Control </a>is a decent choice in an increasingly crowded field of road tubeless options. While it doesn’t top the charts in terms of ride quality, weight, or cost, they have a relatively smooth ride, easy tubeless setup, and durable Graphene-infused rubber compound that should hold up for many miles.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-pro-control-g2.0-tubeless-tire\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L54XS95/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC2F4VVW/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPirelli Cinturato Road\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$64.90</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>344g (700 x 28c)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Size tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>700 x 28c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>26c, 28c, 32c, 35c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>TPI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>60</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tire Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher, Tubeless Ready (with tube)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC2F4VVW/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">\n\n<img width=\"2159\" height=\"1439\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road.jpeg 2159w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pirelli-Cinturato-Road-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent puncture protection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Durable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good all-season tire</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stiff ride</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC2F4VVW/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Pirelli’s Cinturato Road</a> tire is a seriously durable tire that prioritizes puncture protection over ride quality to keep you pedaling through the harshest road riding conditions. Right out of the box, the stiffness of the casing and overall heft of the Cinturato are immediately evident. If puncture protection is your priority, this tire will feel great in your hands. </p><p></p><p>Getting the Cinturato mounted wasn’t easy, nor was it terribly difficult. A tire lever and a small measure of elbow grease were needed to get the beads stretched onto the test rims. The Cinturato is a clincher tire, so at least the process was super simple after that, just adding pressure and ensuring they were seated evenly. </p><p></p><p>According to Pirelli, the Cinturato is able to fend off even the worst debris thanks to <em>Armour Tech</em> construction, which combines a Nylon bead-to-bead high-density layer with an aramid breaker and aramid fibers dispersed into the tread, ensuring protection against even the worst levels of road debris. </p><p></p><p>The tradeoff for all this protection is that the Cinturato doesn’t have the supple, lively ride quality and handling characteristics of lighter, more flexible tires. While the tread surface does offer excellent grip in both dry and wet conditions, the casing doesn’t offer a corresponding level of flex to complement that grip. If you need a flexible and lightweight tire to have fun, look elsewhere. However, if you ride year-round on roads that can be littered with debris, this tire could save you from hopping off to fix punctures, which is much more important. Riding the Cinturato Road gives you the feeling you could ride over anything without even thinking about punctures. Inspecting the tires after rides, we found zero debris lodged into the tread, which is remarkable and speaks volumes about the effectiveness of Armour Tech.</p><p></p><p>If you don’t have time for punctures and don’t need an amazing ride-quality experience, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC2F4VVW/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Pirelli Cinturato Road</a> could benefit your cycling.

It’s not light at 361g, but that doesn’t matter, because it can tackle terrain that would severely challenge, and perhaps even destroy many of the other road tires we tested.</p><p></p><p>Setting up the Pro One TLE 32c was super easy, as promised by the “TLE” or “tubeless-easy” label on the sidewall. The bead popped into place with a few strokes of a floor pump, with the valve core removed. After the bead was in place, sealant added, the valve core replaced, and inflated to 50 PSI, it was time to go find some rough country roads and see how this all-road tire performed. </p><p></p><p>The Addix tread compound has a nice blend of flex and puncture protection. The sidewalls are somewhat rigid, as can be expected from a tubeless-ready tire, but at low pressure, they feel fast and lively. At 32c, the ride characteristics of a tubeless road tire begin to shine, and, after a few rides, the Pro One Addix felt both grippier and faster rolling as the rubber broke in. On pavement, the extra mass is noticeable while accelerating, but once the bike was up to speed, the Pro One Addix 32c felt smooth and fast. The local hero gravel also proved to be a treat on these tires, which unsurprisingly, was super fun on a 32c road tire at low pressure. </p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting that a 32c tire is relatively large for pure road riding. First, a wheel and tire combo this large will significantly alter the handling of a true road bike, especially one that is intended for racing. Also, you might have the sensation of being pushed up away from the ground, which will also change how you feel while maneuvering the bike. Lastly, tires this big actually make every gear on your cassette a bit harder and faster, by accentuating the flywheel effect in your rear wheel. For example, it’s going to feel harder to climb in your easiest gear, and you will also feel like you have some extra speed available when pedaling in your top gear. </p><p></p><p>That said, if you are getting into all-road riding or have hardpacked, smooth dirt and gravel roads within reach on your road rides along with the bike setup to match the 32c volume, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com//dp/B08K98CLMC/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Schwalbe Pro One Addix 32c</a> is a super fun upgrade. The price is high, but the versatility of this tire makes it arguably more valuable than pure road tires or road-friendly gravel tires in the right conditions.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com//dp/B08K98CLMC/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-control-g2.0-tire-clincher\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVittoria Corsa Control G2.0 Clincher\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$80</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>293g (700 x 28c)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Size Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>700 x 28c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>25c, 28c, 30c</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>TPI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>320</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tire Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clincher, Tubeless Ready (with tube)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-control-g2.0-tire-clincher\">\n\n<img width=\"1252\" height=\"835\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Control-G2.0-Clincher.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Control-G2.0-Clincher.jpeg 1252w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Control-G2.0-Clincher-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Control-G2.0-Clincher-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Control-G2.0-Clincher-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Control-G2.0-Clincher-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Control-G2.0-Clincher-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Divine ride quality</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent puncture protection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tread will eventually delaminate from casing</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-corsa-control-g2.0-tire-clincher\">Vittoria Corsa Control G2.0</a> has actually been replaced by the Corsa Pro Control but is still widely available, and well worth the reduced pricing if you want to stick with clinchers. Aside from being clincher-only, the other key difference in this older Corsa Control G2.0 is that it has a two-piece construction where the tread is bonded to the casing. This more traditional construction has some positives and negatives. Starting with the positive, the two-piece construction of the Corsa Control G2.0 delivers better ride quality than the newer, seamlessly constructed Corsa Pro Control. It’s a marginal difference, and somewhat subjective, but it makes sense since the tread and casing have more freedom to flex independently, versus the new design where the casing and tread are seamlessly bonded. The negative of the two-piece construction is that every Vittoria cotton clincher, including the Corsa Control G2.0, will eventually meet the same demise, which is the tread delaminating from the casing. This takes usually thousands of miles and can be postponed by keeping your bike stored in a cool, humid area like a basement, but it’s unavoidable on a long enough timeline.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the cotton casing, a couple of other technologies are utilized in the Corsa Control G2.0 that make it a valuable tire that can perform well anywhere. First, there are four different Graphene compounds used in the tread to strike the perfect balance of low rolling resistance and tough puncture resistance. In the casing, dubbed <em>Corespun-K</em> by Vittoria, Kevlar is mixed into the cotton to bolster the sidewall against cuts. The result of these features is a tire that feels capable of taking on the most challenging rides and grueling races, while also being capable of worry-free training on the roughest of roads. </p><p></p><p>There are reasons why Vittoria moved away from this two-piece style of tire. Delaminating tires is not a great look, and the new, seamless construction method is likely more efficient from a production standpoint. However, the older, two-piece Corsa tires offer an arguably better ride quality, compared to the newer offerings from Vittoria, or almost any other tire for that matter.

The P7 Sport is a clincher, so it must have robust tread and sidewalls in order to protect an innertube, as it won’t seal with sealant like a tubeless tire. Clinchers are easy to set up, and also easy to remove and reinstall in the event of a puncture. It’s honestly hard to imagine what you’d have to encounter to puncture the P7, though. </p><p></p><p>Close to home, intentionally riding over dodgy debris and road damage to see if the P7 would pinch flat or puncture was handled impressively well. Especially when hitting sharp edges of potholes, the P7 helped not only the wheels, but the entire bike feel more stable and planted. </p><p></p><p>While properly testing the P7 Sport’s performance, they felt a bit sluggish during accelerations, which isn’t surprising, given they are a “Sport” tire aimed more at recreational road riders than. While Pirelli calls the P7’s tread compound “Pro”, these definitely feel like a pro’s training tire and not their race tire. The ride quality of the P7 Sport is muted and there’s a bit of feedback lost in the P7 casing due to a lack of flexibility. So, while they don’t necessarily inspire you to maneuver aggressively, during routine cornering and descending, the Pro Compound offers plenty of grip. </p><p></p><p>If you want to take some of the risk out of riding on nasty or beat-up roads, while saving some money, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpirelli-p7-sport-tire-clincher\">Pirelli P7 Sport </a>could be a great choice.

Sure, writing about bikes is our job, but riding them is a passion that all of our staff share. Whether testing a new bike, lining up for a weekend race, or simply riding for the fun of it, we know that having the right gear for the job can improve our experience and performance. And, while they are often overlooked, tires are our connection to the road and critical component when it comes to comfort, control, and safety while road biking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our road bike tires buyer’s guide tester and review author, Bennett Shane, has been cycling for over two decades and knows a thing or two about tires. Bennett spent many years between the tape in his racing days, training hard and constantly searching for marginal performance gains. Though his racing days are behind him, he spends an inordinate amount of time on the bike for fun and fitness, stacking vertical and ticking off the miles on mountain roads throughout the Pacific Northwest near his home in Portland, OR. As a gear-obsessed cyclist, Bennett stays up to date on all types of road cycling products, including tires, in his ongoing effort to find the best gear to improve his performance on the road. He also spent many years working for numerous prominent brands in the cycling industry, and he has a unique perspective on products from both sides of the table. The combination of his cycling and industry experience makes Bennett particularly adept at analyzing the design, materials, construction, and most importantly, the performance of the products he tests. In addition to road bike tires, Bennett has contributed his experience and expertise to several other buyer’s guides including <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/\">protective road bike helmets</a>, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">best road bike shoes</a>, and the most <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-saddle/\">comfortable road bike saddles</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Weighing a test tire on a digital scale\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-tire-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Claimed weights are not always accurate, so we weighed each tire we tested to see how they compare to manufacturers’ specs. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For our road bike tires buyer’s guide, we researched the best and most highly regarded models on the market before rounding up 18 to test and compare side by side. After weighing each model for comparison to manufacturers’ specs, they were mounted on compatible rims of Bennett’s small fleet of boutique road bikes to determine ease of installation and measured with digital calipers to check their inflated size. Over the course of several weeks, each model was taken out for multiple road rides on surfaces varying from super smooth and freshly paved to rough and littered with debris. Hills were climbed and descents were bombed while paying close attention to and keeping detailed notes on each model’s rolling and handling characteristics, puncture resistance, suppleness (or lack thereof), and weight and its effect on acceleration and climbing efficiency. When testing wrapped up, we zeroed in on our favorites and those that excel for specific reasons compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Measuring road bike tire width with digital calipers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-tire-measurement-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>We measured all of the tires we tested with digital calipers for consistency and comparison to manufacturers’ specs.

One of the most important factors is the type of rims you have, which will largely dictate what type of tires you can use. After that, factors like tire size, weight, TPI (threads per inch), tread design, puncture resistance, durability, and price are all things that may influence a purchase decision. Here we’ll break down the most important considerations when searching for your next pair of road bike tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Road Bike Tires</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three types of tires used in road cycling: clincher, tubeless, and tubular. While they all look quite similar when mounted on a wheel, they differ in how they hold air and the rims they will be compatible with. Their different constructions and designs may also affect their ride quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Clincher</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard, or tube-type, clincher tires have been around for years and are still the most common out on the road. These tires require an inner tube to hold air pressure and will mount to any rims (clincher or tubeless-ready) that have a “hooked” bead wall. The benefits of clincher tires are that they are generally less expensive and lighter weight than tubeless options, along with being easy to deal with when installing or fixing a flat. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tubeless</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite widespread acceptance among mountain and gravel riders, tubeless road tires have been a bit slower to catch on. Times are changing, however, and tubeless tires are gaining more traction (pun intended) among road cyclists. Though they look nearly identical to a standard, tube-type clincher, slight variations to their construction and design make them capable of holding air without a tube when used with a compatible tubeless-ready rim. They are designed to have a tight and precise enough seal between the tire bead and the rim’s bead wall that they hold air without one. In addition to the tire and rim interface, a liquid tubeless tire sealant is added to help seal up any leaks and hopefully plug up any small punctures or cuts that may occur while riding. In general, tubeless tires are claimed to be more supple and forgiving because they can be run at lower pressures while also being more resistant to flats and punctures than an inner tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tubeless tires require tubeless-ready rims with tubeless valve stems and an airtight seal of the rim bed using tubeless rim tape. There are now two styles of tubeless-ready rims on the market, more traditional rims with “hooked” bead walls, and the newer “hookless” rims. It is important to know which type of tubeless rim you have, as not all tubeless tires will be compatible with both types. Virtually all tubeless tires will work with the hooked tubeless-ready rims, but only those that specify they are for use with hookless rims should be used with hookless rims. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tubular</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tubular tires have long been popular with professional cyclists and racers. Tubular, or sew-up, tires essentially combine the tire and the tube (sewn together) into a single unit which then gets glued onto a tubular-specific rim. They are claimed to provide a supple ride quality and weight savings depending on the rim and tire combination. Due to the fact that the tires are glued to the rims, they are not very practical for everyday use or riders who are not part of a pro team. Not only are they more expensive than clincher or tubeless tires, but roadside fixes are not possible and swapping tires is an arduous and time-consuming process. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Panaracer Agilest TLR tire mounted on a tubeless-ready rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-rim-compatibility-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>It’s important to match your tires and rims. For example, the Panaracer Agilest TLR tire can be set up tubeless on these tubeless-ready Campagnolo rims.

Not all tire and rim combinations will work together, so it’s important to identify what type of rims you have to determine which tires will work for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Clincher</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard clincher tires must be used with a tube and they will work on “hooked” rims whether they are clincher-only or tubeless-ready. We’ll say it again, if you are using a tube-type clincher tire on a hooked tubeless-ready rim, you still need to use an innertube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tubeless</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All tubeless tires will work with “hooked” tubeless-ready rims. This includes tires that are designed to work with “hookless” tubeless rims. Tubeless tires can also be used on clincher rims that are not tubeless-ready with an innertube. You can learn more about some of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-tubeless-wheels/\">best tubeless road wheels</a> chosen by the Bikerumor staff. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Hookless Tubeless</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The only tires that can be used on hookless rims are those that are specifically designated as “hookless tubeless”. Though they don’t look much different than other tubeless tires, they have to meet a different ETRTO standard for compatibility with hookless rims. Hookless tubeless tires can also be used on hooked tubeless rims and on clincher rims (with a tube).

Tubeless road tires have been in a state of flux since first coming to the road bike market nearly two decades ago in 2006. Safe to say, the technology hasn’t been widely accepted until recently, when many professional teams began to make the switch from tubular or “sew-up” tires, to tubeless. It’s important to note that this transition by pro teams wasn’t as much made by choice, as by necessity, since most major wheel companies that sponsor pro teams simply stopped making tubular rims, which was the traditional choice since the dawn of the sport. This forced most teams to adopt tubeless rims and compatible tires to go along with them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneous to professional teams ditching their tubular tires, riders experienced mixed results and mixed messaging from brands over exactly what the benefit of road tubeless tires was. First, Hutchinson and Shimano offered tires and rims, respectively, and marketed this as a solution to punctures. Since the interior of the tire would be coated with a latex-based sealant that would rush to the site of the hole in the tire and congeal into a barrier, preventing a significant volume of air from escaping, riders could continue pedaling along in bliss, instead of pulling over to address the puncture. In practice, this worked most of the time, but due to the high pressures that many riders use inside their tires, the sealant often had a hard time plugging larger tears in the tire casing, while it sprayed out all over the bike frame and nearby riders. This was followed by a bit of a lull in tubeless road tire development for quite a few years. More recently, road tubeless was rebooted, backed by testing that indicated tubeless setups were faster than running a clincher tire, even in combination with a low-friction latex innertube. This idea was debated within the industry without resolution until rim manufacturers tipped the balance by developing “hookless” tubeless rims that simply won’t work with clincher tires. Previous to “hookless”, all “tubeless-ready” (hooked) rims would accept a tubeless or clincher tire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alas, despite the semi-coalescence around hookless rim designs, the fitment of tubeless tires to tubeless rims still isn’t automatic. As of publication, there is no standard fitment of road tubeless tires and rims. Although this negotiation between rim and tire manufacturers continues, many combinations of rims and tires simply don’t mate well, leading to installation headaches and potential safety concerns out on the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atop these issues is perhaps the most pressing question – do tubeless tires actually outperform clinchers to any appreciable degree? While it is true that foregoing the rubber innertube decreases mass and friction, the added weight of sealant and tubeless valves, plus the extra heft of road tubeless tires (upwards of 140g/ tire in some cases) surely offset, if not fully cancel out, those gains. That said, a combination of tubeless tire and rim that is easy to install, and creates a tire profile appropriate for running lower pressure of 60-70 psi, for example, will provide a plush, confident, and fast ride. Provided that the sealant is kept fresh, it will seal most minor punctures as you ride, or at least allow you to simply add back the lost air once the seal has been achieved. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch.jpeg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch.jpeg\" alt=\"The Vittoria Corsa Pro Control road bike tires hot patch info\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Control-hot-patch-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Road bike tires have been trending wider in recent years with 28c to 30c becoming the norm for most riders.

(photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tire Size</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, road bike tires have increased in volume substantially, with 28 or even 30c tires being the norm. While 23c and 25c tires are certainly lighter and in some cases more aerodynamically efficient, most racers and nearly all recreational and endurance road riders prefer the larger volume 28c and 30c tires because of their comfort and confident maneuvering. This is made possible because, with a larger volume of air, the air pressure can be kept lower, allowing the tire to better conform to road chatter and lateral forces of turning the bike. That said, not everyone loves to run pressure super low as higher pressures can provide sharper handling or may simply feel better for a given tire or bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the tire clearance of your frame is a consideration when deciding what size tires you need. Nearly every disc brake road bike will clear at least a 28c, but to be safe, visually confirm 3mm of clearance all around the tire in both the front fork as well as near the chainstays, downtube, and bottom bracket. The width of your rims is also important, as super narrow rims may not pair well with some of today’s wider road bike tires, and vice versa. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wheel Size</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheel size is pretty straightforward as the overwhelming majority of road bikes have wheels that are 700c. There are some riders and bikes that may use smaller, 650c wheels, though they are fairly uncommon. All of the tires we tested are available in the 700c size, and many are also offered in 650c. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Vittoria Corsa N.EXT road bike tire on a digital scale\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>All other things being equal, lighter is generally better. At 239g, the Vittoria Corsa N.EXT is pretty lightweight for a 32c. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At constant speeds, rotational weight isn’t much of a consideration, although tire weight will impact the acceleration and efficiency of your bike whilst climbing slightly. Some larger road tires, and especially those that are tubeless-ready can weigh nearly as much as a carbon fiber rim, while other tires are over 100g lighter. So, it makes sense to check out the weight before choosing, especially if you plan to tackle a lot of vertical and have invested in a lightweight wheelset for that purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI.jpeg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Cotton Hell of the North detail shot.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tire-TPI-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With a 320 TPI cotton casing, the Specialized Turbo Cotton Hell of the North Tires are renowned for their supple ride quality. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>TPI (Threads Per Inch)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>TPI (threads per inch) ratings are found on nearly all road tires, and essentially tell you how supple a tire will feel on the road. Casing fabrics vary, and those with a lower thread count use coarser threads, while those with a higher thread count use thinner, more finely woven fabrics that are generally more supple. So, in theory, the higher the thread count, the smoother the ride. While that sounds simple, it isn’t always that cut and dry, depending on the way the manufacturer calculates their thread counts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Road tire casings often consist of multiple layers of casing fabric, and often it is the sum of those layers that is the claimed TPI. Other manufacturers may specify the thread count of a single layer of casing fabric, despite there being multiple layers. Not every 300 TPI tire will feel the same, but in general, all 300 TPI tires will feel faster, grippier, and more comfortable than any 100 TPI tire out there. Since tires are the most cost-effective upgrade on any road bike, it’s often worth it to choose a tire with the highest thread count that you can afford. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Puncture Resistance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the conditions of the roads you ride, puncture resistance may be more or less important in your purchase decision. In years past, there was always a trade-off between high performance and puncture protection. The faster and more supple the tire, the more likely it was to puncture, and in most cases, the shorter its lifespan. Thanks to additives like Graphene and advancements in tire casing constructions, these choices around performance and reliability have become less fraught, as manufacturers developed a Goldilocks combination of these seemingly opposite traits. Still, there exists a clear line between training and racing tires, and if puncturing represents a ride ruined, we encourage you to look at more durable options like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fvittoria-rubino-pro-g2.0-tire-clincher\">Vittoria Rubino</a> or a super puncture-resistant model like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F886505%2Fcontinental-gatorskin-tire\">Continental Gatorskin</a>. If speed and grip are your priorities, but you hate punctures (who doesn’t?) the good news is that you can now have it all as many manufacturers have figured out ways to better balance these traits in modern tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Air Pressure</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years, road tires were ridden at very high pressures under the assumption that a firmer tire rolled faster. Traditional tire pressure of 120psi is now debunked, as it has been proven to increase rolling resistance on all but the glassiest of road surfaces and accelerate rider fatigue through increased vibration. Part of the reason for this high pressure was the smaller tire volumes available at the time, which has increased significantly in recent years. Again, research has concluded that counter to most folks’ intuition, larger tires don’t decrease speed. Larger tire volume means more air volume, and this allows for lower air pressure. Benefits are lower rolling resistance, better grip, and less rider fatigue. Typical pressure used today is anywhere from 50 to 85psi, depending on specific tire volume from 26 and 30c, road conditions, and rider weight. You can determine your ideal pressure using online tire pressure calculators, like <a href=\"https://silca.cc/pages/sppc-pro\">Silca’s Tire Pressure Calculator</a> to get the most out of your upgraded rubber.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The tread design on the Vittoria Corsa Control G2.0 road bike tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tire-tread-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>While road bike tires are generally slick, some have a little tread added to the shoulders to add grip in certain conditions. The Vittoria Corsa Control G2.0 is one such tire that has a smooth center and some shallow tread added to the shoulders for cornering. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tread Patterns</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the majority of road-specific tires are generally “slick” and have little to no tread pattern, many feature small, shallow tread patterns added to the shoulders of the tire. Tread patterns are unique to each tire, and while tire manufacturers all claim theirs to be the most effective in wet conditions, the reality is that it’s a great way for them to visually demarcate their products, and little more than that. No tire’s tread pattern is going to prevent you from losing control when you overshoot a wet corner and brake too hard because there simply isn’t enough contact patch on the ground to override the physics of the situation. In other words, a completely slick tire devoid of any tread pattern is likely just as effective as any elaborate pattern of grooves or nubs. Judging a tire based on how the tread looks is like judging a book by its cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Caring for Tires</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It pays to routinely inspect your tires for debris. Oftentimes, punctures result from debris that has actually been lodged in the tire for a while, slowly working its way closer to the air inside as you continue to ride. The tip of a thumbtack and a smartphone flashlight will help you remove most foreign objects from the tread before this can happen. This makes a great item on a pre-ride checklist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tire rotation can be worthwhile as well. The rear tire is under significantly more pressure and will begin to square off at the edges more quickly than the front tire. Hopefully, before this happens, you can extend the life of the rear tire by moving it to the front, and vice-versa. Tires will also last longer if your bike is stored in a cool environment out of direct sunlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Price</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tires are consumable and wear at vastly different rates, depending on their design, rubber compounds, and the conditions to which they are subject. It’s important to match the type of tire to your expectations of how long a tire will last, given how often, and where you like to ride. Generally, lighter, more supple tires with thinner treads will roll quicker but also wear out sooner and cost more to replace. Tires with more heft generally cost less and last a bit longer if they don’t see too much abuse. Oftentimes, high-performance tires can be bought in 2-packs, which typically saves a bit on cost. Even if you don’t need two tires at the time, assuming that you like a particular model, having a backup in storage is a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, most clincher tires cost less than their tubeless counterparts. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3HZHSCX/brbggearcyclingroadbiketires-20\">Panaracer Agilest Clincher</a> retails for $57, while the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbiketires&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpanaracer-panaracer-agilest-tlr-tire\">Panaracer Agilest TLR</a> goes for $80. So, you can save money by using tubes and clincher tires. Also, many of the harder-wearing tires designed for casual, recreational road cycling are on the lower end of the price spectrum. While they tend to be a little heavier and less supple than fancier tires, the tradeoff for durability may be worth it to those who ride rough pavement regularly or who aren’t as concerned with marginal performance gains.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action.jpeg\"><img width=\"1353\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action.jpeg\" alt=\"road bike tires action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action.jpeg 1353w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-tires-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Where the rubber meets the road.

If you have clincher rims, you’ll need to get clincher tires to go along with them, or use a tube in a tubeless-ready tire. On the flip side of that coin, if you have hooked tubeless-ready rims, you can use tubeless-ready tires, or clincher tires with a tube. Those with hookless rims will need to use tires that are hookless tubeless compatible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many riders prefer to ride clincher tires because they are more affordable and generally easier to deal with, and they can’t justify the added price and weight of tubeless tires. Others find the benefits of tubeless to outweigh the price and weight penalties for their needs. So, beyond getting tires that will work with your rims, you’ll need to consider the pros and cons of each type.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How can I tell if my rims are tubeless-ready?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Most tubeless-ready wheels/rims will say it somewhere on the rim itself. If it is not printed anywhere on the rim, a quick internet search of your wheel/rim model will generally provide the answer. If that fails, your local bike shop is another great resource and they will probably be able to tell you whether your rims are tubeless compatible or not. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What is hookless tubeless?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Hookless rims are becoming more prevalent in road cycling and the primary difference is that the bead wall is flat and does not feature a “hook” that is present on a hooked tubeless rim or a clincher rim. Given that the tire bead does not have a “hook” to hold it in position, hookless rims are only compatible with tires that are specifically designed to pair with them. This involves tighter tolerances between the tire and rim and relies solely on the outward pressure of the tire against the rim wall to stay in place. One of the purported benefits of the hookless system is that it improves the shape of the tire, and thereby the aerodynamics, with a smoother transition from the rim as there is no hook to go around. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there may be some benefits to hookless tubeless, it should be noted that hookless rims are only compatible with certain tires that are hookless compatible. The road tubeless market is heading in this direction, however, so it’s certainly not a bad time to jump on the hookless train if it appeals to you. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why are some road bike tires so expensive?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Like anything in cycling, road bike tires can be expensive. Often, this is a result of more advanced construction methods, rubber compounds, and the research and development involved in making high-performance tires. A good example is tubeless tires versus tube-type clincher tires. Tubeless tires are almost always more expensive than their clincher counterparts because of the additional materials and technologies needed to make them hold air, resist punctures, and provide support without the use of an inner tube. Generally speaking, higher-performance tires are typically more expensive with fancier rubber, higher thread counts, and claims of marginal performance gains. If these things don’t matter that much to you, there are lots of less expensive options that get the job done with a slight weight and ride quality penalty. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"1874\" height=\"1249\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg\" alt=\"POC Omne Air MIPS road bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg 1874w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-pedals/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Road bike pedals buyer's guide featured image\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Road-Bike-Pedals-featured-image-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Pedals of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-road-bike-tires/\">The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1a99a2099600679c09b4cc6c733b9ab1705c010302be219df55ed5383a774e8c","category":"Cycling"}
