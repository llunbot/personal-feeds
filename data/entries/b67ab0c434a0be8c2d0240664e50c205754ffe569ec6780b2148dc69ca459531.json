Yet it still packs-in 2 pre-load plugs to fix a tubeless tire puncture fast on the side of the road. And it sells for effectively the same price as the plastic original, at essentially the same light weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to fit a tubeless repair solution into a jersey pocket, small saddlebag, or pack without tacking up extra space, this looks like the best Dynaplug solution yet!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dynaplug Micro Racer: big tubeless repair skill in tiny package</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log.jpg\" alt=\"Dynaplug Micro Racer tiny lightweight alloy tubeless tire repair tool, closed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_plug-on-a-log-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Dynaplug)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they launched the ultralight $48 Racer – a 95mm-long x 14g fiber-reinforced nylon tube with 2 pre-loaded Dynaplugs, one on either end. Then, came the upgraded $58 Racer Pro – a 108mm-long x26 aluminum upgrade that expanded your tire fixing capabilities, with 4 pre-loaded Dynaplugs, double-ended Twin Tube plugs on either end. But how often do you need to fix 4 holes at once?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech.jpg\" alt=\"Dynaplug Micro Racer tiny lightweight alloy tubeless tire repair tool, Twin Tube tech\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_Twin-Tube-tech-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynaplug took the Pro back to the drawing board and realized that thanks to the Twin Tube solution, they could give you the capabilities of the OG Racer in a much smaller package. All they had to do was chop off one end. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed.jpg\" alt=\"Dynaplug Micro Racer tiny lightweight alloy tubeless tire repair tool, open or closed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_open-or-closed-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new $50 aluminum Dynaplug Micro Racer is only 72.6mm long, 12.4mm in diameter, and weighs just 15g. Inside Dynaplug puts one hardened 304 stainless steel Twin Tube, with 2 pre-loaded soft nose tip plugs at-the-ready. It threads into the small one-ended handle. And a snap-fit cap slide on from the other end.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_ready-to-stab-a-tire.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_ready-to-stab-a-tire.jpg\" alt=\"Dynaplug Micro Racer tiny lightweight alloy tubeless tire repair tool, standin at attention\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_ready-to-stab-a-tire.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_ready-to-stab-a-tire-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_ready-to-stab-a-tire-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_ready-to-stab-a-tire-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dynaplug-Micro-Racer-tiny-lightweight-alloy-tubeless-tire-repair-tool_ready-to-stab-a-tire-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The handle &amp; cap are machined from 6061 aluminum, and polished to a nice shine. The whole thing is made in the USA, in Chico, CA. Get it now directly from Dynaplug or their retailers. More plugs are available separately. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynaplug also says that gravel &amp; mountain bikers could in theory separately buy a 2-size Standard/Megaplug Twin Tube, to convert the new Micro Racer to have a combo setup with a small &amp; large plug pre-loaded to fit any puncture you might encounter. We haven’t seen the Twin Tubes available separately yet. So fingers crossed on that front.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://dynaplug.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dynaplug.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tiny-alloy-dynaplug-micro-racer-packs-2-fast-tubeless-tire-repair-plugs-smaller-than-ever/\">Tiny Alloy Dynaplug Micro Racer Packs 2 Fast Tubeless Tire Repair Plugs, Smaller Than Ever</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b67ab0c434a0be8c2d0240664e50c205754ffe569ec6780b2148dc69ca459531","category":"Cycling"}
