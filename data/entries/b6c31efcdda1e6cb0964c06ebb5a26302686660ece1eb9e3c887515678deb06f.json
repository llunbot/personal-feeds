{"title":"How Tim Cook Navigated Out of Trump’s Tariffs on China, For Now","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/17/apple-iphone-tariff-exemption-trump/","date":1745252056000,"content":"\n<p>Jeff Stein, Elizabeth Dwoskin, and Cat Zakrzewski, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As President Donald Trump’s enormous new tariffs on China rippled\nthrough global supply chains, Apple CEO Tim Cook went to work\nbehind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>Cook spoke to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week about\nthe potential impact of the tariffs on iPhone prices, two people\nfamiliar with the phone call said, speaking on the condition of\nanonymity to reflect private conversations that were previously\nunreported. Cook spoke with other senior officials in the White\nHouse, the people said. And he refrained from publicly criticizing\nthe president or his policies on national television, as many\nother executives have over the past several weeks.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the week, the Trump administration agreed to exempt\nfrom import duties electronic products that Apple produces in\nChina, an action that also granted a reprieve to other large U.S.\nfirms, including HP and Dell. Trump did so despite the\nrecommendations of senior White House aide Peter Navarro, who had\nwanted the taxes to remain in place, the people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Three points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Tim Cook manages this dance with aplomb. This is not a “good system”. But given the way Trump operates, what Cook managed here is not merely good for Apple but better policy, period.</p></li>\n<li><p>Howard Lutnick is a lickspittle moron with the demeanor of a used car salesman who knowingly sells overpriced lemons to suckers. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/644320/us-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-says-well-be-making-iphones-in-the-us\">Here he is on Meet the Press a few weeks ago</a> bragging that “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones — that kind of thing is going to come to America.” Keith Olbermann mentioned in a recent episode of his podcast that Lutnick is a dead ringer for Morrie Kessler, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UNC4nvo4Wo\">the bookmaker of “Morrie’s Wigs” fame</a> from <em>Goodfellas</em>, and I can’t un-see it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Peter Navarro is such a profound dope and abject fraud — seriously, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/18/771396016/white-house-adviser-peter-navarro-calls-fictional-alter-ego-an-inside-joke\">he’s not even good at making up phony names</a> — that he makes Lutnick seem like a credible, responsible official.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/21/cook-trump-tariffs-wapo\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b6c31efcdda1e6cb0964c06ebb5a26302686660ece1eb9e3c887515678deb06f","category":"Tech"}
