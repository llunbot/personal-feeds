And soon, it will be time for the recreational vehicle segment to start adding batteries and electric motors. Today, Thor Industries revealed a new hybrid class A motorhome that demos a new hybrid electric powertrain <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/how-harbinger-is-building-commercial-evs-with-20-year-life-spans/\">from Harbinger</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Electrification will play a central role in the future of mobility, including RVing,\" said Thor Industries President and CEO Bob Martin. \"This first-of-its-kind hybrid platform and our ongoing collaboration with Harbinger are reinforcing Thor's leadership in this segment and creating major points of product differentiation for our family of companies.\"</p>\n<p>Thor and Harbinger have been working together for a while now—in March <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/harbinger-delivers-first-customer-electric-truck-chassis-to-rv-maker-thor/\">Thor took delivery</a> of a medium-duty EV chassis from Harbinger. But the battery EV RV will only have a range of about 250 miles on a single charge. By comparison, the two companies say that the hybrid RV should have a range of twice that—500 miles—courtesy of a 140 kWh lithium-ion traction battery and a gasoline-powered range extender.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051838#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
