The model family can generate text, images, and speech while processing multiple types of input including text, images, audio, and video. It's similar to multimodal AI models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/\">GPT-4o</a>, which powers OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>\"Gemini 2.0 Flash builds on the success of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-strikes-back-at-openai-with-project-astra-ai-agent-prototype/\">1.5 Flash</a>, our most popular model yet for developers, with enhanced performance at similarly fast response times,\" said Google in a statement. \"Notably, 2.0 Flash even outperforms <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/\">1.5 Pro</a> on key benchmarks, at twice the speed.\"</p>\n<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash—which is the smallest model of the 2.0 family in terms of parameter count—launches today through Google's developer platforms like Gemini API, AI Studio, and Vertex AI. However, its image generation and text-to-speech features remain limited to early access partners until January 2025. Google plans to integrate the tech into products like Android Studio, Chrome DevTools, and Firebase.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"653eb31dc8d8e0b58e42bd60bb1bb9a37f561ad6c3ae58d90d520dab1cda250a","category":"Tech"}
