Both share needle bearings that are super light, last as long as your bike (or longer) and greatly reduce the likelihood of shimmy. The Rinko headset (left) has retainers to keep the bearings inside when you remove the fork as you pack your bike for travel. The Low-Stack headset (right) is designed to work as a replacement even on bikes with very short steerer tubes, with a stack height of just 38 mm. Both are superlight (119 g and 96 g, respectively). They are polished, not anodized, so they conduct electricity in case you use your frame and fork as the return path for your generator-powered lighting system. Both are available now from <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/product-category/components/headsets/\" target=\"_blank\">Rene Herse</a>.</p>\n<p>Retail pricing: $209 (Rinko headset) $189 (Low Stack headset)</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rene-herse-needle-bearing-headsets/\">Rene Herse Needle Bearing Headsets</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"0e1fc8d7b929c2582a26d894a06de82f11c6455a7fa79a20c7758f972ffa4717","category":"Cycling"}
