Other potential features mentioned include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, and an improved front camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs part of this plan, the report says that Apple does not plan to release an iPhone 17 Plus next year, so the lineup would still consist of four models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the third time that a slimmer iPhone 17 model has been rumored this month, following reports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/\">from Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu</a> and display industry expert Ross Young, who said the device <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">will have a 6.5-inch screen</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report cautions that Apple is still testing multiple designs for this new iPhone, and potential delays could push the device's release beyond 2025.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/\">iPhone 17 Lineup Rumored to Feature All-New Slim Model Above Pro Max With 'Major Redesign'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-lineup-rumored-to-feature-all-new-slim-model-above-pro-max-with-major-redesign.2426680/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"792b89c1dc429e3d64cf3be99fc62bf5a285fc068ce55c995bcdc149d4974209","category":"Apple"}
