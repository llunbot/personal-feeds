There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's February 2, and today's image concerns an emission nebula about 5,000 light-years away in the Cygnus constellation.</p>\n<p>Discovered more than 230 years ago by William Herschel, astronomers believe the Crescent Nebula is formed by the combination of an energetic stellar wind from a Wolf-Rayet star at its core, colliding with slower-moving material ejected earlier in the star's lifetime. Ultimately, this should all go supernova, which will be quite spectacular.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000699#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000699&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e228754fdd7942964581867c38d13c8685139a4b647c0c415a12163ebdaabb10","category":"Tech"}
