{"title":"‘This was my first time ever on a velodrome’ - Rosa Klöser, from the Kansas flint hills to the Roubaix cobbles","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/this-was-my-first-time-ever-on-a-velodrome-rosa-kloser-has-gone-from-unbound-gravel-to-paris-roubaix-femmes","date":1744524484000,"content":"\n      <p><span>Rosa Klöser is learning fast. The past two years have seen the German woman win the biggest gravel race in the world, Unbound 200, and go on to sign a contract with Canyon//SRAM-Zondacrypto, one of the most successful women’s WorldTour squads, now a teammate of a <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-femmes-preview\">Tour de France Femmes</a> champion. Just four months into her professional road career, she’s finished arguably the biggest one-day race on the calendar: <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-everything-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix</a> Femmes avec Zwift.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Klöser is no stranger to hard days on a bicycle: she finished her victorious Unbound covered in mud and grime after 200-miles through hailstorms on the flint roads of Kansas, but the Hell of the North, she says, was an entirely different beast.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>“It was definitely a great experience. It really lived up to everything and more. It's crazy, such a hard race,” she smiled a few moments after finishing her race in the iconic Roubaix velodrome. Klöser’s face was shaded with dust after a day in the wheels which was marred by crashes and mechanicals – every rider has a story to tell from their day on the iconic cobbles of Northern France. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>“There's something happening all the time, crashes right and left, even from the start. I must say I enjoyed myself the most on the cobbles, but I really suffered on the flats in between,” she commented. “I had a small mechanical after the second feed zone where my Hammerhead came off the bike, so I had to let the group go. But I found a really nice group to finish it off with.”</span><b></b></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-2209901483_2048x2048.jpg?v=1744524370\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><em>Image: Getty</em></p>\n<p><span>At least at Roubaix, unlike in gravel events, Klöser could take a spare wheel when things went wrong, rather than doing her own repairs on the move. The Canyon//SRAM rider is still getting used to the ins and outs of professional road racing – it wasn’t just the cobbles which were a new experience for her.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I must admit I was a bit nervous when I came into the velodrome because this was not only my first Paris-Roubaix, but also my first ever time in a velodrome,” she laughed. “I was very happy when I crossed the finish line without crashing out anyone in my group.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>The wealth of off-road experience, however, was an asset to the 28-year-old during the most technical parts of the route. Klöser is used to gingerly navigating around loose surfaces on tight corners when she races on the gravel, a skillset easily transferable to the dry and dusty farm tracks which are home to the sport’s toughest one-day race.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>“I could tell that in the corners, especially on the cobbles, I would always make up bike lengths or I even had to be really gentle on the brakes because I was overtaking people,” she explained. “I think I think this was a good recon, and I hope to come back next year and definitely improve on my results.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>At the end of last year, when Klöser was just about to start her journey in the WorldTour with Canyon//SRAM, she told <em>Rouleur</em>: “My dreams are to race the biggest and gnarliest road races, like Strade Bianche and Paris-Roubaix and show that this off-road experience can actually help you.” She has one box ticked in her first season. And did the Hell of the North live up to expectations?</span></p>\n<p><span>“The atmosphere and the velodrome is crazy. You're already hearing people scream from far outside the velodrome, so I definitely think it's a very special experience,” Klöser grinned. “I haven't done as many classics so I don’t know if this is the hardest - but I'm pretty sure it ranks pretty high.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Cover image: Canyon///SRAM-Zondacrypto</em></p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"18cc7b9fbd7c95c4c113dc258bd611194da297f8876d71aa203e189d7d16d6eb","category":"Cycling"}
