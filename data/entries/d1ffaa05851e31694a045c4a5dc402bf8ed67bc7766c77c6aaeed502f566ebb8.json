alt=\"Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless tyre\" title=\"Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless_2K7A3171_01\" />                                            <p>Hutchinson has announced the Challenger Tubeless, a new ultra-endurance road tyre with a claimed lifespan of 10,000km.</p>\n<p>The Challenger Tubeless builds upon the existing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/hutchinson-challenger-review/\">clincher version</a> and is claimed to offer “a level of puncture resistance never achieved in a performance road tyre before”.</p>\n<p>As such, the Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless is targeted at all-season and ultra-endurance cycling.</p>\n<p>According to the French brand, it has been tested by athletes competing in the previous two editions of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/2022-transcontinental-race-tech-gallery/\">Transcontinental Race</a>, a self-supported, ultra-endurance race across Europe.</p>\n<p>Hutchinson also says the Challenger Tubeless has such good air retention that it can be used without <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">tubeless sealant</a>, if desired.</p>\n<p>The Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless costs £59.95/€59.99 and is available in 700×25, 28 and 32c sizes.</p>\n<h2>Designed to last</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

Challenger Tubeless tyre is designed for high mileage and challenging conditions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hutchinson</i></span></div>\n<p>While many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bike tyres</a> feature headline claims about low rolling resistance, it’s rarer to see such a heavy focus on durability and high mileage.</p>\n<p>Hutchinson, though, says the Challenger Tubeless tyre is designed to last for 10,000km, or “an entire year’s riding” (or perhaps multiple years if you average less than 27.4km per day).</p>\n<p>It’s said to achieve this using a new technology called Hardshield.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

/>\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hutchinson says the Challenger Tubeless tyre has been tested in ultra-endurance events.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hutchinson</i></span></div>\n<p>Hutchinson’s Hardshield technology takes the form of two puncture protection strips that are layered with the Challenger’s 3×127 TPI (Threads Per Inch) casing.</p>\n<p>One of these layers is a ‘flexible wide polyamide’ (a type of nylon fabric) that covers the width of the tread, while the second is a narrower strip of ‘super-strong Aramid threads’ (Aramids are another type of synthetic fibres, that can be woven into fabrics), which provide additional protection underneath the tyre’s contact patch.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless tyre cutaway\" title=\"Hutchinson

tread.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hutchinson</i></span></div>\n<p>In addition to this, the Challenger’s dual-compound tread is 2.3mm thick – twice the thickness of an ordinary road bike tyre, according to Hutchinson.</p>\n<p>These technologies are claimed to enable the Challenger Tubeless tyre to resist punctures up to a force of 170 newtons.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Hutchinson says “punctures typically occurred at a force rating of 80 to 120 newtons” in an unnamed range of competitor tyres.</p>\n<h2>Sealant-free tubeless</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

/>\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Though it’s a tubeless tyre, Hutchinson says the Challenger Tubeless doesn’t need sealant to help it hold air.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hutchinson</i></span></div>\n<p>While most tubeless tyres typically require the use of tubeless sealant for an airtight setup, Hutchinson says the Challenger Tubeless doesn’t need it.</p>\n<p>It says sealant can be used to help fix any punctures, but that it’s also possible to put in an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tube</a> and repair the tyre at home for a “mess free tubeless experience”.</p>\n<p>Hutchinson says this is made possible by the tyre’s new Airshield technology, which sees a flexible butyl layer (the same material used to make traditional inner tubes) applied to the inside of the casing.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless tyre cutaway\" title=\"Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless_Air Shield-omega-2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The casing is lined with butyl to help the tyre retain air, without significantly impacting comfort or ride feel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hutchinson</i></span></div>\n<p>This is claimed to improve air retention significantly, without harming the tyre’s ability to deform to imperfections in the road.</p>\n<p>A “robust, abrasion-resistant coating” has also been applied to the tyre’s tubeless bead, which helps in forming an airtight seal with a tubeless-ready rim.</p>\n<h2>Hutchinson Challenger Tubeless specification</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n
