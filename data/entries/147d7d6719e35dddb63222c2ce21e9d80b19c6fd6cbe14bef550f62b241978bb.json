{"title":"Skull long thought to be Cleopatra’s sister’s was actually a young boy","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/nope-this-skull-is-not-cleopatras-half-sister/","date":1736795960000,"content":"<p>Scientists have demonstrated that an ancient human skull excavated from a tomb at Ephesos was not that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_IV\">Arsinoë IV</a>, half-sister to Cleopatra VII. Rather, it's the skull of a young male between the ages of 11 and 14 from Italy or Sardinia, who may have suffered from one or more developmental disorders, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83870-x\">new paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports. Arsinoë IV's remains are thus still missing.</p>\n<p>Arsinoë IV led quite an adventurous short life. She was either the third or fourth daughter of Ptolemy XII, who left the throne to Cleopatra and his son, Ptolemy XIII, to rule together. Ptolemy XIII didn't care for this decision and dethroned Cleopatra in a civil war—until Julius Caesar intervened to enforce their father's original plan of co-rulership. As for Arsinoë, Caesar returned Cyprus to Egyptian rule and named her and her youngest brother (Ptolemy XIV) co-rulers. This time, it was Arsinoë who rebelled, taking command of the Egyptian army and declaring herself queen.</p>\n<p>She was fairly successful at first in battling the Romans, conducting a siege against Alexandria and Cleopatra, until her disillusioned officers decided they'd had enough and secretly negotiated with Caesar to turn her over to him. Caesar agreed, and after a bit of public humiliation, he granted Arsinoë sanctuary in the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. She lived in relative peace for a few years, until Cleopatra and Mark Antony ordered her execution on the steps of the temple—a scandalous violation of the temple as a place of sanctuary. Historians disagree about Arsinoë's age when she died: Estimates range from 22 to 27.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/nope-this-skull-is-not-cleopatras-half-sister/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/nope-this-skull-is-not-cleopatras-half-sister/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"147d7d6719e35dddb63222c2ce21e9d80b19c6fd6cbe14bef550f62b241978bb","category":"Tech"}
