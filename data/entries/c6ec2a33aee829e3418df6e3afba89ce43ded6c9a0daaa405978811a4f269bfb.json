After a user toggles off the setting, the bug can cause it to turn back on, resulting in any songs that a user adds to a playlist being added to their music library in an unwanted manner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17-Apple-Music-Favorites-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nUsers have complained about this issue on the <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255315913\">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/1894yu1/psa_add_playlist_songs_setting_broken_with_ios/\">Reddit</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2412489/post-32767023\">MacRumors Forums</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iloveryutoo_/status/1731573208581636312\">X</a>. While the complaints have increased since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/apple-releases-ios-17-1-2/\">iOS 17.1.2 was released</a> last week, the bug appears to affect many other software versions, leading some users to speculate that there might be a server-side problem for Apple to fix.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue has frustrated users, as removing an unwanted song from the library also removes the song from all playlists, and there is no way to change this behavior. The bug can repeat itself over and over again, and there is no lasting solution right now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe underlying cause of the issue is unclear. We've reached out to Apple for comment, and we will update this article if we receive a response.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/apple-music-add-playlist-songs-to-library-bug/\">Apple Music Users Experiencing Bug With 'Add Playlist Songs' Setting</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-users-experiencing-bug-with-add-playlist-songs-setting.2412783/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c6ec2a33aee829e3418df6e3afba89ce43ded6c9a0daaa405978811a4f269bfb","category":"Apple"}
