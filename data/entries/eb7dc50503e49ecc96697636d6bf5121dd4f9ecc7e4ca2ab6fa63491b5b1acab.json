The company has announced a full range of 14th-generation Core desktop CPUs, some new 14th-generation Core CPUs for high-end gaming and workstation laptops, and the first non-Ultra chips to bear the new \"Core 3/5/7\" branding that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/next-gen-core-and-core-ultra-cpus-lose-an-i-as-intel-shuffles-its-branding/\">sheds the generational branding</a> entirely. We'll go over the updates shortly.</p>\n<p>But my main takeaway, as a long-time observer of processor branding, is that Intel had made its new naming system even more confusing for people who actually want to know what kind of processor they're getting.</p>\n\n<p>Intel <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/intels-14th-gen-desktop-cpus-are-a-tiny-update-even-by-modern-standards/\">said in October</a> that it was sticking with the 14th-generation branding for its new desktop CPUs because they were so similar to the 13th-generation chips (they all use the same underlying Raptor Lake architecture, itself a minor revision of the 12th-gen Alder Lake). It makes some degree of sense that it's being extended to the HX-series laptop chips, because these have always been desktop silicon repackaged for laptop use. So far so good.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994334#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994334&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb7dc50503e49ecc96697636d6bf5121dd4f9ecc7e4ca2ab6fa63491b5b1acab","category":"Tech"}
