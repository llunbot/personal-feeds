There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's February 26, and today's image highlights the core of a (relatively) nearby supernova.</p>\n<p>In the astronomy community, SN 1987A has somewhat legendary status. The first observable light from this exploding star in the Large Magellanic Cloud reached Earth in February, almost 37 years ago to the day. It was the first supernova that astronomers were able to observe and study with modern telescopes. It was still discussed in reverent terms a few years later when I was an undergraduate student studying astronomy at the University of Texas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005703#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005703&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"43adc8236bd1c4c346d5158072817b13f261d0d1d1186ebdae7e6d68c8e59593","category":"Tech"}
