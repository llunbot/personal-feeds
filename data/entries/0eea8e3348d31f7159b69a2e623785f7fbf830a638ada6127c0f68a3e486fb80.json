reasons for taking out a specialist bike insurance product, rather than relying on home insurance or other insurance products that you might hold. We’ll run through these below and answer the important questions that many riders have about cycle-specific insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is bike insurance worth the cost?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own a bike, you’re probably going to need to insure it separately from your general household insurance, as discussed <a href=\"#versushome\">below</a>. If your bike were lost or irreparably damaged, could you afford to replace it yourself? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bicycles are at high risk of theft, because of their ease of removal and resale, either complete or as parts. Some thieves specialise in bike theft, while there has been a worrying increase in the number of cyclists being robbed of their bikes while out riding in some locations. The rate of retrieval of stolen bikes is very low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of new bikes has increased greatly over the last few years, so a bike that may have cost you a few hundred pounds five years ago may now cost over £1,000 to replace. The cost of replacing one of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">best road bikes</a> has risen even more.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just the bike itself that cycle insurance will cover, specialist bike insurance will cover a wide range of cycle-related equipment and liability that other insurance that you may own in general will not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What does cycle insurance generally cover?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a wide range of different items that cycle insurance may cover. Some of them are fundamental to every policy, while others, such as European or worldwide cover are optional add-ons that some policies may offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic items that you can expect to be covered by any policy include theft, loss and accidental damage. You can also expect personal accident cover and third party liability insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many insurers will offer a basic level of cover alongside a premium tier, which includes additional benefits, while others take a pick-and-mix approach to additional coverage items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, a policy may, as mentioned, cover travel abroad. Other options that may be covered by the policy or may be available as additional cost items include competitive use, helmets, cycle computers and other accessories, race fee reimbursement, replacement bike hire, medical expenses and even the cost of a taxi home if your bike suffers a mechanical while out riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialist bike insurance vs home insurance?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many household insurance policies will cover bikes in the home, although some will require you to add them as additional high-value items before they’re covered. However, it’s less common they’ll cover bikes outside of your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some comprehensive home insurance policies will cover bikes outside the home, they tend to cover limited value bikes and often come with significant strings attached. This is one reason why specialist cycle insurance has become increasingly popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benefits include dealing with a claims team that understands the specific needs of the average bicycle nerd, plus the availability of a range of options not found on standard policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Insuring against bike theft</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some criminal making off with your beloved bike is a thought that haunts most cyclists. But in terms of cover, there’s a big difference between whether your bike goes missing from your home, shed, holiday rental or off the street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the details of your cover to be sure where you stand. Also, be aware many policies consider leaving a bike for more than a set time, often as little as 12 hours, as abandonment and won’t then cover against its theft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, don’t forget that your bike isn’t the only thing that can get stolen – accessories like GPS computers, lights and child seats can all be added to many policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which bike lock do I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/02171043/theft_cut_d_lock-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"theft_cut_d_lock\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many policies will have a maximum value they’ll cover if the bike is left locked outside. They’ll also often specify the type of lock needed to cover a bicycle of a particular value. To do this most refer to the Sold Secure level, a four-tier security grading system administered by the Master Locksmiths Association, whose independent tests determine how secure each lock is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in bronze, silver, gold and the highest diamond level, many specialist cycle-insurers will only insure bikes protected with the most secure locks. Check our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-choosing-the-best-bike-lock\" target=\"_blank\">best bike locks</a> for some suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Insuring against damage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Theft isn’t the only thing to insure against. Damage resulting from a crash or other accident is also worth considering. Again, beware of the context in which the damage might happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some policies will cover you if you hit a pothole while out on your commute but won’t pay out if you suffer as the result of a mass pile-up during a competitive event. Some policies may insure you against malicious damage as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Third-party liability insurance for cyclists</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re judged to be at fault after a collision you could find yourself being sued in civil court. The bar for this can often seem incredibly low, like in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/24/cyclist-settles-for-30000-pounds-after-hitting-pedestrian-who-was-looking-at-phone\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Hazeldean</a>, who was forced to pay over £60,000 after a woman stepped in front of him while looking at her phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party liability insurance covers you if a member of the public makes a compensation claim against you because they believe you’re responsible for them having been injured or damaging their property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relatively cheap to take out by itself, it’s also included with all <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/british-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">British Cycling</a> memberships. Be aware that some policies may not cover you when riding in the USA or some other countries. Check the small print if you’re planning to ride overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does bike insurance cover races?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most insurance doesn’t cover use of your bike in competition in its standard offering, but the majority will allow you to opt into competitive use as an extra cost option. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, sportives are not considered as competitive events, but if you intend to enter a gran fondo it’s worth checking with your insurer, as the pointy end of these events will include prizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cycling travel and event insurance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Holidays or going abroad can be another area worth considering when insuring your bike. If you intend to hop on a rental bike and potter around, you’ll probably be covered by standard health insurance. Anything more extreme, and you’ll need to up your level of cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many insurers will grade your activities relative to their assumed risk level. This runs the gamut from cycle-touring up to downhill mountain bike racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure where you stand, and don’t undersell your activity level. You might think of a sportive as a non-competitive event, but be sure your insurer does too. Off-road riding or riding above a certain altitude can also affect whether your cover is valid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, unless you have very comprehensive cover, your bikes, kit and accessories may need further insuring, especially as damage in transit can be an issue when taking your bike abroad. Racing is also frequently not covered as standard by many health or damage insurance policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To find the best bike insurance quote for you, head to our handy <a href=\"https://cyclist.quotezone.co.uk/bicycle-quote/index.php?id=ccfa0694e26049f21c87b835d6275e85\" target=\"_blank\">bike insurance comparison tool</a> provided by Quotezone</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A guide to the specialist cycle insurers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"bike insurance company logos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/bikeinsurance.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our cycle insurance comparison tool provides you with comparison quotes from all the cycle insurance specialists below. We’ve outlined the offered cover and optional extras for each. Bear in mind that the below is only an outline of coverage offered at the time of writing. Coverage, inclusions and exclusions may be changed by individual insurers at any time prior to purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always check the details, exclusions and terms and conditions of every policy before purchasing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ALA Insurance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ALA Insurance’s offering covers basic theft and/or damage to your bike worldwide, with accessories needing to be added separately. Options like personal accident cover, legal expenses cover or cycle rescue services can then be added on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving its standard cover a fair bit cheaper than many competitors, 10,000 plus positive TrustPilot reviews of the wider company suggest there’s no reason to expect this will come at the cost of them attempting to wriggle out of any claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also leaving you free to add extras as you need them, the result is lean cover as standard or the option to build a bespoke package to cover your other needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although generally similar in their customisable features, ALA market-specific products cover commuters, electric bike users, mountain bikers, roadies and touring cyclists. The firm even offers specific BMX insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Assetsure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the basics, Assetsure covers loss or damage to a bike box up to £500, replacement cycle hire and recovery of your excess if an accident is not your fault and you can provide full details of the other party. If you do need to claim, Assetsure says that it won’t up your premium next year as a result. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basic cover includes use for commuting and sportives and you can add a competitive use extension if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve taken n+1 to extremes, Assetsure will cover up to ten bikes on a single policy and there’s the option to add additional family members. It will cover bicycles up to £12,500 in value. There’s a separate e-bike insurance policy available and Assetsure provides new for old cover based on your stated replacement cost for your bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bikmo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another company offering highly tailored insurance for cyclists, Bikmo’s basic ‘go’ cover insures against theft and accidents during normal use, while its Race level cover is so thorough as to give you up to £1,000 if you miss a key competition due to an injury or crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, even those with the most basic level of protection will benefit from £150 returning home cover, allowing them to hop into a taxi if a mechanical or accident cuts short their ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, even the cheaper policies have overseas protection and will cover you during sportive events. Unlike many insurers, Bikmo also has specialist products for e-bike users, including cover for more adventurous activities like electric mountain biking expeditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately underwritten by Hiscox, there’s 0% on monthly payments, meaning you won’t pay interest if you choose not to pay in one lump sum. There’s a zero excess too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cover Cloud</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cover Cloud’s standard insurance covers damage and theft to your bike. To that, you can add a wide range of supplements, covering items such as personal accident, third party liability and worldwide usage. The menu of coverage levels starts with Essential, while Prime and Ultra add extra items of coverage. You can choose the excess that you’re willing to pay, starting at £50. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any bike under three years old will be covered new for old and you can add accessories cover with tiers up to £300, £600 or £900.

Both styles of insurance can be extensively tailored to meet your exact requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are allowed to insure your bike for as little as five days and, while the process is a little more involved than with some firms, the upshot is that you won’t be paying for anything you don’t need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you know you’re sticking to home roads for the year, you won’t have to pay for overseas cover. Ditto – if you don’t own a car, you can avoid paying the part of the premium that covers theft from a vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with even the firm’s essential-level cover still including provision for emergency physio and dental services, even its basic policies aren’t overly spartan. Also offers comprehensive cover for racers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use our <a href=\"https://cyclist.quotezone.co.uk/bicycle-quote/index.php?id=ccfa0694e26049f21c87b835d6275e85\" target=\"_blank\">bike insurance comparison tool</a>, provided by Quotezone, to find the best cycle insurance for your needs</strong>.
