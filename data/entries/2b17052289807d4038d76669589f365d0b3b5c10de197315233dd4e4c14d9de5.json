{"title":"AirPods 3 Rumored to Launch Alongside iPhone 13 at Expected September Event","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/airpods-3-with-iphone-13-event/","date":1627026852000,"content":"The third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> will likely launch at the same event revealing Apple's upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup, according to a <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210723PD210.html\">report from <em>DigiTimes</em></a>, which makes the claim citing sources familiar with the matter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-gizmochina-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report as a whole echoes previous reporting that production of the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ will kickstart in August, meaning a launch shortly after can be easily expected. <em>DigiTimes</em> states that shipments of certain components needed for the ‌AirPods‌ have already begun in \"small volumes\" and will be ramped up in the third and fourth quarters of the year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe third-generation ‌AirPods‌ will be the first update to the standard ‌AirPods‌ since March of 2019, where it gained wireless charging support, \"Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>\" support, and improved internals. Compared to the modest update in 2019, the upcoming ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature an entirely new design that takes inspiration from the higher-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nImages <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">claiming to be the upcoming AirPods 3</a> have shown a design in line with leaks and rumors. The images showcase the ‌AirPods‌ with a shorter stem and functionality for snap-in silicone earpieces. As for the ‌AirPods‌ case, the upcoming case will be wider compared to the previous generation, and more in parity with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman recently stated he believes that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a> for the upcoming iPhones will occur in September. Due to the global health crisis, Apple last year held an event in October for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, but the company is likely on track to resume back to its September event traditions beginning this fall. Gurman has also stated that the third-generation ‌AirPods‌ will launch later this year. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's ‌AirPods‌ have continued to grow and dominate the wireless earphone market, with the Cupertino tech giant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/canalys-airpods-device-shipments-2020/\">estimated to have shipped nearly 110 million AirPods</a> and Beats headphones in 2020, far exceeding any other maker. With the lack of a headphone shipping in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> box, Apple may want to use its rumored September event to market the ‌AirPods‌ 3 alongside the new iPhones, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/kuo-airpods-pro-2-next-year/\">fueling AirPods success for the remainder of 2021 and into 2022</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe updated ‌AirPods‌ may also prove vital for the ‌AirPods‌ line's future health, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/apple-cutting-airpods-production-report/\">Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to lower production</a> of its current ‌AirPods‌ due to lower-than-expected sales. Despite its dominance in the wireless headphone market, there is growing competition from other makers making similar wireless earbuds but at lower price points. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFurther down the line, Apple is also working on the second generation of the ‌AirPods Pro‌, which may feature advanced health tracking and a design similar to the recently launched Beats Studio Buds. The new ‌AirPods Pro‌, however, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/airpods-pro-2-with-sensors-and-fitness-coming-2022/\">shouldn't be expected until next year</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/airpods-3-with-iphone-13-event/\">AirPods 3 Rumored to Launch Alongside iPhone 13 at Expected September Event</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-3-rumored-to-launch-alongside-iphone-13-at-expected-september-event.2305182/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2pYvQCH-Kj8:G2GJn3f6qVw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2pYvQCH-Kj8:G2GJn3f6qVw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/2pYvQCH-Kj8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2b17052289807d4038d76669589f365d0b3b5c10de197315233dd4e4c14d9de5","category":"Apple"}
