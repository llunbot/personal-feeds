It also doesn't have any details such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAT&amp;T said it learned of the data breach on April 19, and that it is unrelated to an earlier security incident in March. The company said it does not believe the data is publicly available at this time, and it continues to work with law enforcement to identify and apprehend those involved. At least one person is said to have been arrested.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAT&amp;T told <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/\">TechCrunch</a></em> that the most recent compromise of customer records were stolen from the cloud data giant Snowflake during a recent spate of data thefts targeting Snowflake's customers. Other companies that have confirmed stolen data from Snowflake include Ticketmaster, QuoteWizard, and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCybersecurity researchers from incident response firm Mandiant say the hacker group is mostly based in the US and those involved are financially motivated. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAT&amp;T customers concerned about phishing and smishing scams should visit the company's <a href=\"https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000102979\">support article</a>, which also includes advice on how to protect yourself from online fraud.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/hackers-steal-att-phone-records/\">Hackers Steal Phone Records of 'Nearly All' AT&amp;T Customers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hackers-steal-phone-records-of-nearly-all-at-t-customers.2431183/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dba304c7a1dd7bf585e876cd2e0fa4240e6f5c1effabf2db6afcdac06cdaa96a","category":"Apple"}
