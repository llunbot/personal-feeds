{"title":"iOS 15: How to Use Hide My Email","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hide-my-email-ios/","date":1629398496000,"content":"With the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, Apple rebadged its paid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> plans to \"‌iCloud‌+\" to reflect the fact that subscribers now get access to additional privacy features like Private Relay and Hide My Email. This article explains what Hide My Email is and how to use it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/hide-my-email-safari-demo.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nHide My Email builds on the idea of Sign in With Apple by providing you with unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox whenever you want to keep your personal email address private. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's especially useful if you suspect that a business you're transacting with is likely to share your email address with ad agencies or other third-parties for marketing purposes. Using a random email address means you can delete the address at any time, ensuring unsolicited emails don't reach your inbox.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>How to Create an Email Address Using Hide My Email</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe following steps show you how to create a new dummy email address with Hide My Email, for use in Safari and Mail.
