{"title":"Bye bye Bioracer: Ineos Grenadiers reveal new Gobik kit for 2024","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/bye-bye-bioracer-ineos-grenadiers-reveal-new-gobik-kit-for-2024","date":1702465201000,"content":"\n      <p><span>2024 will be a fresh chapter for the Ineos Grenadiers in more ways than one. The British WorldTour team has been thrown into the spotlight recently following departures of some of its key staff and riders, but it’s not only changes to their personnel that will be new for Ineos in 2023. After working with Belgian brand Bioracer for just two seasons, they have today released their 2024 kit in collaboration with Spanish brand Gobik.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>While the brand making the kit is new, the design has stayed relatively similar to this year’s kit, featuring a combination of orange, red and black, though the new kit sees an addition of some shadows stripes on the front of the jersey. While the previous kit featured navy blue shorts, it looks like Gobik have opted for traditional black shorts in 2024, featuring simple white logos to represent the team’s key sponsors such as Ineos and Pinarello. The Ineos Grenadiers have previously also been seen wearing fluorescent orange training kit – it’s not clear whether this will continue in 2024, especially given that the colour on the new jersey appears to be much brighter than the darker red on the team’s current Bioracer kit.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Gobik-INNEOS-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702307855\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>For Gobik themselves, this collaboration is an important step in the journey of the Spanish brand, allowing product testing and development in conjunction with another one of the best teams in cycling. Alberto Garcia, who is Gobik’s CEO of product, commented in a press release: “This alliance is a great opportunity to be part of the great structure that is Ineos Grenadiers. They have always been characterised by being at the forefront, both at a sporting level in the preparation of the riders and at a technological level with all the material, bicycles, accessories and of course, the apparel they will wear throughout the season.</span></p>\n<p><span>“With Ineos we have established an ambitious short and medium-term project together with its entire performance team, to integrate all our products, customise them to the maximum for each of the riders and develop new references seeking the best performance. We are sure that at technical levels, in terms of aerodynamics and performance, the joint work with the team in the coming years will mean an important advance in our products that of course will ultimately reach the end consumer.”<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Gobik-INNEOS-6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702307888\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>Gobik also added that in 2024, the Ineos Grenadiers will use three new products; a jersey (Reactive), a bib short (Lancer) and gloves (Viper) which form part of the brand’s most premium and high-end collection, developed for use at the very top level in cycling. These products will also be available to buy via the Gobik website. In previous seasons, Gobik has outfitted the likes of FDJ-Suez, Movistar and UAE Team Emirates – adding the Ineos Grenadiers to this makes an impressive list for the brand that was born in 2010 after the local club of Yecla in Murcia required a race kit to be made.</span></p>\n<p><span>Both the Ineos Grenadiers and Gobik will hope that the team can achieve plenty of success in the new jersey after a couple of turbulent seasons. The likes of Tom Pidcock, Geraint Thomas, Carlos Rodriguez and Egan Bernal serve as the British team’s main hopes for Grand Tours, while Magnus Sheffield, Ethan Hayter and Filippo Ganna will head up the team’s Classics squad in 2024.</span></p>\n<p><span>They will also welcome a new performance director for 2024 in Scott Drawer and a new CEO in the form of John Allert who was previously managing director of the squad. It’s yet to be seen how all these changes will impact the team who was once a force to be reckoned with at the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> – the departure of the figures such as Dave Brailsford and Rod Ellingworth will undoubtedly be a loss, but perhaps a refreshed approach and new ideas is exactly what Ineos needs to flourish. That’s what Gobik will be dreaming of, anyway.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"60cd14c60daf330a708d4889fc79da89327312c9412ddf91628bcd7898ef513b","category":"Cycling"}
