After WISE completed checkouts and ended its primary all-sky astronomical survey, NASA put the spacecraft into hibernation in 2011 after its supply of frozen hydrogen coolant ran out, reducing the sensitivity of its infrared detectors. But astronomers saw that the telescope could still detect objects closer to Earth, and NASA reactivated the mission in 2013 for another decade of observations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043082#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043082&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1bf3b8b92752f4071ae2041456cd2b96adb31dbe8ba5c983625c3afd3690d397","category":"Tech"}
