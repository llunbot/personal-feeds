The Exploration Company, co-located in France and Germany, and Thales Alenia Space of Italy beat out four other companies in the competition for ESA funding through the LEO Cargo Return Service program.</p>\n<p>These contracts will run for two years, until June 2026. In this first phase of the program, The Exploration Company and Thales Alenia Space will refine their concepts, mature technologies, and focus on requirements for their cargo vehicles. ESA plans to award contracts for the second phase of the LEO Cargo Return Service program in 2026, eyeing a round-trip demonstration flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2028.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027315#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027315&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3ebb600373b94bc8abd0786dd4a96f0b1acca45fa75e9ade4bab30ca3d512fb5","category":"Tech"}
