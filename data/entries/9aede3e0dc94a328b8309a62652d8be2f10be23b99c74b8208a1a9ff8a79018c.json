{"title":"Judge Denies Apple’s Appeal; Ordered to Keep Allowing Link-Outs to the Web in the U.S. App Store","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/679946/apple-rejected-court-attempt-to-stop-app-store-web-links","date":1749159222000,"content":"\n<p>Jacob Kastrenakes, The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In April, a federal judge demanded that Apple begin allowing web\nlinks, cease restricting how links are formatted, and enable\ndevelopers to offer external payment options without giving the\ncompany a cut of their revenue. Apple promptly appealed and\nrequested that the order be put on hold until the legal\nproceedings were finished.</p>\n\n<p>But an appeals court has now denied Apple’s emergency request to\nblock the order. The court said it was “not persuaded” that\nblocking the order was appropriate after weighing Apple’s chances\nto succeed on appeal, whether Apple would be irreparably harmed,\nwhether other parties would be hurt if the order is halted, and\nwhat supports the public interest.</p>\n\n<p>The rejection bodes poorly for Apple’s chance of overturning the\norder, which stems from a lawsuit by Epic Games.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s the denial <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70190916/40/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/\">from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a>, nearly in its entirety, omitting only legal citations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s Emergency Motion Under Circuit Rule 27-3 for a Partial\nStay Pending Appeal is DENIED. In deciding whether to impose a\nstay, we consider: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a\nstrong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2)\nwhether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;\n(3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the\nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the\npublic interest lies.” Apple “bears the burden of showing that the\ncircumstances justify an exercise of [our] discretion.” After\nreviewing the relevant factors, we are not persuaded that a stay\nis appropriate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The earliest this might get overturned, it seems to me, is the end of this year, but I get the feeling this injunction is here to stay.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/apple-appeal-denied-antisteering\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9aede3e0dc94a328b8309a62652d8be2f10be23b99c74b8208a1a9ff8a79018c","category":"Tech"}
