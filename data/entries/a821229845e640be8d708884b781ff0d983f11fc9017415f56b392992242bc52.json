Wifi Dabba remains unique in the annals of DF sponsors — they’re looking for investors in the DF audience, not customers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wifidabba.com?r=df\">Wifi Dabba</a> is deploying 100,000 public wifi hotspots at neighborhood tea stalls across Bangalore city. They’re creating a low cost connectivity layer <a href=\"https://wifidabba.com/laser?r=df\">powered by lasers</a> for a billion underserved Indians. A billion people!</p>\n\n<p>2,000 Wifi Dabba hotspots are live across the city in homes, offices and retail stores. They form a public wi-fi mesh network that delivers super fast, super cheap internet to data hungry users. The average user on their network is 20 years old and consumes 3 GB of data each day. </p>\n\n<p>They’ve tokenized their network to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to buy a hotspot for $100 and mint tokens when data is sold. Apply the code “DARINGFIREBALL” at checkout and get 2× the number of hotspots you pay for. This offer is exclusive for the DF audience.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/13/wifi-dabba\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a821229845e640be8d708884b781ff0d983f11fc9017415f56b392992242bc52","category":"Tech"}
