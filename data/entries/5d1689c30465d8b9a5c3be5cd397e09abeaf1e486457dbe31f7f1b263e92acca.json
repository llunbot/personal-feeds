Academic researchers have responded by trying to understand the scope of the problem, identifying the most <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/musks-x-spreads-more-disinformation-than-rival-social-networks-eu-says/\">misinformation-filled social media networks</a>, organized government efforts to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/elon-musks-x-allows-china-based-propaganda-banned-on-other-platforms/\">spread false information</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996570855/disinformation-dozen-test-facebooks-twitters-ability-to-curb-vaccine-hoaxes\">prominent individuals</a> who are the sources of misinformation.</p>\n<p>All of that's potentially valuable data. But it skips over another major contribution: average individuals who, for one reason or another, seem inspired to spread misinformation. A study released today looks at a large panel of Twitter accounts that are associated with US-based voters (the work was done back when X was still Twitter). It identifies a small group of misinformation superspreaders, which represent just 0.3 percent of the accounts but are responsible for sharing 80 percent of the links to fake news sites.</p>\n<p>While you might expect these to be young, Internet-savvy individuals who automate their sharing, it turns out this population tends to be older, female, and very, very prone to clicking the \"retweet\" button.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027838#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d1689c30465d8b9a5c3be5cd397e09abeaf1e486457dbe31f7f1b263e92acca","category":"Tech"}
