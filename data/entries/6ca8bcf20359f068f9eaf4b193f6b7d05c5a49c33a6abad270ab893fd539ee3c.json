RGB OLEDoS technology produces light and color directly from nearby RGB sub-pixels on a single layer, putting an end to the need for a color filter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis results in significantly higher brightness compared to WOLED and color filter OLEDoS displays, which depend on filtering white light through an RGB color layer. It is also markedly more efficient than WOLED and color filter technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung is currently the only company capable of supplying RGB OLEDoS displays following its acquisition of eMagin earlier this year, with the company likely set to take over from Sony in Apple's supply chain if it proceeds with the upgrade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, like Omdia, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/\">previously mentioned</a> a 2027 launch time frame for the second-generation Vision Pro headset.
