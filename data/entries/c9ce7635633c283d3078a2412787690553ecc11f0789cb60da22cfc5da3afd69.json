As Andy Rivkin, one of the team leaders, was getting ready to appear in NASA’s live broadcast of the experiment, a colleague posted a photo of a pair of asteroids: the half-mile-wide Didymos and, orbiting around it, a smaller one called Dimorphos, taken about 7 million miles from Earth.</p>\n<p>“We were able to see Didymos and this little dot in the right spot where we expected Dimorphos to be,” Rivkin recalled.</p>\n<p>After the interview, Rivkin joined a crowd of scientists and guests to watch the mission’s finale on several big screens: As part of an asteroid deflection mission called DART, a spacecraft was closing in on Dimorphos and photographing its rocky surface in increasing detail.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024593#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024593&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9ce7635633c283d3078a2412787690553ecc11f0789cb60da22cfc5da3afd69","category":"Tech"}
