But as WD President of Technology and Strategy Dr. Siva Sivaram told Ars in an interview, OptiNAND bears almost no resemblance to the much-maligned hybrid <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive\">SSHD</a> drives first introduced in 2011 and 2012.</p>\n<p>Instead of promising SSD-like speeds via caching of customer data, OptiNAND offers increased areal density by removing firmware-accessible metadata from the disk itself and storing it on NAND instead.</p>\n<h2>20TB per disk without SMR</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WD-000-EAMR-pole-diagram.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Like last year's 20TB SMR drives, the OptiNAND drives employ EAMR in the form of an additional current to the main pole of the write head.
