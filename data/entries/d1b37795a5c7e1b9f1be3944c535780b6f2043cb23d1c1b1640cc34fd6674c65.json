Sound advice for most, but if Chris Roberts had taken it to heart then this glorious titanium road bike might never have existed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By day Roberts is a mechanical engineer, by night an amateur racer with a precise vision of his dream bike: timeless yet modern; elegant round tubes paired with contemporary details such as integrated cables, electronic shifting, dropped seatstays and ample tyre clearance. He wanted a machine that struck a balance between classic aesthetics with cutting-edge performance and, as far as he was concerned, it just didn’t exist.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Havren Frameworks\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Roberts says his aim with this build is to blend classic looks with modern details.</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Modern aero bikes look great, but I find they date very quickly, especially with their elongated tube profiles,’ he says. ‘You just can’t beat round tube shapes for a timeless look.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than settle for compromise, Roberts used his engineering knowhow to create the bike he was looking for. Havren Frameworks was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Where I’m from originally in mid-Wales, there’s a large wooded area called the Hafren Forest,’ Roberts says. ‘It’s a great spot for gravel and it’s where my local cycling club got its name. Despite the spelling, in Wales it’s ‘<em>hav</em>-ren’, so I swapped the ‘f’ for a ‘v’ to ensure correct pronunciation.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Havren Frameworks\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For Roberts, framebuilding was a natural step. It combined his passion for bikes with the parts of his job he most enjoyed: design and fabrication. And he’s no stranger to welding, a skill he’s had plenty of time to develop in his modestly sized Shropshire workshop.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I make great use of the space that I have,’ he says. ‘Once you’re methodical about how you use it, you really don’t need that much to make one-off bike frames. I have a manual milling machine and a manual lathe. I also have a TIG welder and a granite surface table to check alignment of the frames. Then I have an area where I fabricate the frame, and another for the build.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As if building a bike from scratch wasn’t enough of an undertaking, Roberts decided to design and make all the tools from scratch, starting with the jig – no simple task given that the accuracy of the frame relies on it being exactly right. He also made a tool for mitring seatstays and chainstays, and a tube bender to put a curve in them.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Havren Frameworks\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Thin-walled bicycle tubing presents a particular challenge when bending because it crumples so easily,’ Roberts says. ‘To overcome this, the dies and mandrel of the tube bender have to be machined to perfectly match the tube’s outer diameter. Gaps of even 0.5mm will cause the tube to crumple. It grips the tube perfectly to size and the mandrel forms it over the bending die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot of thought went into the aesthetics too. It was crucial for me to get the tube sizes right so that they looked good together and gave the right riding characteristics. I also wanted to make sure it had all of the modern techy bits that I was after in a bike, such as T47 bottom bracket, thru-axles, disc brakes, internal cable routing and space for 30mm tyre clearance.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/curve-titanosaur\">Meet the maker: Curve’s new massive bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/atelier-pariah\">Meet the maker: Swanee Ravonison of Atelier Pariah</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/andre-pfeil-kocmo-titan-bikes\">Meet the maker: André Pfeil of Kocmo Titan Bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Striking the balance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Agonising over tube proportionality brought Roberts to his first big head-scratching moment. He was adamant about internal routing but was reluctant to use the oversized head tube needed to accommodate the requisite 52mm bearings. He feared it would throw the frame’s proportions out of whack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘After some deliberation I decided to go with a 44mm head tube and place EC44 cups on the bottom and top,’ Roberts says. ‘This allowed me to use the oversized 52mm bearings while keeping the tubes visually balanced.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Havren Frameworks\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘By far the most challenging part of working with titanium is welding. Titanium has amazing properties that make it perfect for bike frames – it’s extremely light and strong with excellent corrosion resistance – but it’s tricky to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Titanium is very reactive to oxygen and contaminants when it’s being worked on. Even the oils from your fingers can contaminate the weld. To make sure I get it right, the weld area has to go through a rigorous cleaning process. It’s scrubbed with a Scotch pad, then cleaned with acetone. Finally it gets a bath in the ultrasonic cleaner.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Havren Frameworks\" srcset=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-06-970x647.jpg 970w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/meet-the-maker-havren-frameworks-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Once the frame was done, Roberts got to work selecting the components that would best suit his aesthetic and performance needs. These include a Shimano Ultegra Di2 groupset, DT Swiss ARC 1100 wheels with Vittoria Corsa Pro tyres, Enve carbon seatpost, Fizik Argo R1 saddle and various bits and bobs from Hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Havren Frameworks’ first bike, but Roberts plans to make many more. One idea he’s toying with is a road bike using 3D printed titanium parts for the head tube, seat tube, bottom bracket and dropout joints, bonded to carbon tubes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I don’t want to produce anything in bulk,’ he says. ‘That sort of thing doesn’t excite me. I just want to focus on making one-off, unique and stunning bikes that give me the same sense of joy and pride I get when I ride this one.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• Havren Frameworks has yet to set up a website, but you can see images of this bike being constructed at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/havrenframeworks\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/havrenframeworks</a>.
