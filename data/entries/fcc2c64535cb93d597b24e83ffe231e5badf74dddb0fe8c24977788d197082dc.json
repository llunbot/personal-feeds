The Stash System comes in a few flavors depending on how the tool housing clings to the inside of your steerer. Spencer has been using both the <a href=\"https://granite-design.com/collections/stash-system/products/stash-rt\" target=\"_blank\">Stash Ratchet Tool</a> and the <a href=\"https://granite-design.com/collections/stash-system/products/stash-multitool-plug\">Stash RCX</a> and, below, reviews the tools along with the Stash system…</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"887\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-7.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-7.jpg?w=887&amp;quality=75 887w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-7.jpg?resize=768,1154&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"887\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3-1.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3-1.jpg?w=887&amp;quality=75 887w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3-1.jpg?resize=768,1154&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Granite Design’s Stash system allows you to keep a multi-tool stored inside the steerer of your bike’s fork. The concept isn’t new; the first time I saw something similar was the OneUp Components EDC years ago. OneUp’s system initially required engraving threads into a fork steerer so the headset could be tensioned. It seems they now moved to a threadless system akin to the products offered by Granite Designs, which are the subject of this review.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Travis <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/steerer-tube-tool-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed similar systems from OneUp and Bontrager</a> last year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"604\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/zoolander-predicted-the-future-of-fashion-04.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/zoolander-predicted-the-future-of-fashion-04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/zoolander-predicted-the-future-of-fashion-04.jpg?resize=768,464&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s dive into the details of two versions of the Stash system.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-9.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-9.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-9.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-9.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-9.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-9.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Stash RT</h3>\n<p>The Stash RT (ratchet tool) consists of a spring-loaded tool carrier, a long M5 bolt, and a bottom cap. The M5 bolt holds the two pieces together to preload the headset like a regular top cap. Notably, this system is most easily used with a suspension fork as they usually have openings at the bottom of the steerer.</p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>159 grams</li>\n<li>2mm, 2.5mm, 3mm, 4mm, 5mm, 6mm, 8mm hex bits, T25, Extended PH1 bit</li>\n<li>Two-way ratchet tool</li>\n<li>Available in orange or black</li>\n<li>Works with steerer lengths from 150mm to 250mm</li>\n<li>$69.99</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"580\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/img_stash-rt_product-page_des_700x780_002-1657504095146.webp?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"580\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/img_stash-rt_product-page_des_700x780_003-1657504095141.webp\" /></p>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>The Stash RT was the more complicated installation of the two tool holders. I luckily had one bike with a tapered steerer shorter than 250mm, but it was a bit close nonetheless. Before you consider this tool, measure your steerer to ensure it is within the working range (150-250mm).</p>\n<p>While a standard L-shaped hex tool works well enough to torque the headset together, I think a T-handle hex would be much more suited. I could barely clasp the hex to get deep enough to tighten the two halves together. Coordinating the two halves of the Stash system and a very long bolt took a few tries. Even once I got it, I had to make sure the Granite Designs logo was pointing the right way, and I repeated the process a few times until I got it right. This felt very doable for most home mechanics, even if it was a bit finicky.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2004\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-12.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-12.jpg?w=2004&amp;quality=75 2004w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-12.jpg?resize=1200,798&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-12.jpg?resize=2000,1330&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-12.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-12.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-10.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-10.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-10.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-10.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-10.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-10.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Tool</h3>\n<p>The Tool is housed in a molded plastic spring-loaded container that excitingly pops up at you as the stem cap is rotated. The spring won’t catapult the tool; rather, it raises it so you can easily grab it.</p>\n<p>The molded tool carrier has inlaid magnets to keep all the 1/4″ bits securely stuck to the carrier. The bits encompass a wide range of sizes from 2mm-8mm hex, T25, and a #1 Phillips head screwdriver. Not <em>everything </em>to repair a bike, but a solid chunk of the standard tools.</p>\n<p>The ratchet feels solid enough for such a small tool. I assembled a bike almost entirely with this tool when I got the opportunity. The only downside of this ratcheting tool is the short reach of the bits. I would have liked them to have included a bit extender as they do with their standalone <a href=\"https://granite-design.com/collections/strap-solution/products/rocknroll?variant=39262281367654\" target=\"_blank\">ratchet tool set</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2004\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-6.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-6.jpg?w=2004&amp;quality=75 2004w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-6.jpg?resize=1200,798&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-6.jpg?resize=2000,1330&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-6.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-6.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-8.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-8.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-8.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-8.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-8.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-8.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No need to thread your steerer</li>\n<li>Bits were held securely via magnets and never came loose while riding</li>\n<li>Good range of bits to fix most common bike issues</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>250mm steerer length can be limiting for tall folks</li>\n<li>Tool bit reach is short</li>\n<li>I heard the tool bottom out the spring on some big hits, which made a disconcerting sound</li>\n<li>Need to be careful changing bits as they are easy to lose</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2004\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3.jpg?w=2004&amp;quality=75 2004w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3.jpg?resize=1200,798&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3.jpg?resize=2000,1330&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Stash RCX</h3>\n<p>Staying true to the Stash system, the RCX incorporates a smaller multi-tool and uses a compression plug instead of a long through-bolt. This system doesn’t rely on a lower cap or open steerer, so it is a great option for plenty of carbon forks.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-2.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-2.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-2.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-2.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-2.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-2.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>110  grams</li>\n<li>2mm, 2.5mm, 3mm, 4mm, 5mm, 6 mm hex bits, T25, Flat-head screwdriver</li>\n<li>Available in orange or black</li>\n<li>Works with any steerer compatible with a compression plug</li>\n<li>$54.99</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>The RCX installation is more involved than the RT, but it should still be no problem for at-home mechanics. Granite Designs’ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZknRke3TU8s\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> will show it better, but the system is quite clever and uses the tool housing to install the compression plug at the proper height.</p>\n<p>Once the plug is installed, it all fits together as normal, with the tool housing serving at the top cap to hold tension on the headset.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-1.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-1.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-1.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-1.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-1.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-1.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The tool slides into the housing and is held in by a simple O-ring. The O-ring locked the tool in the housing during off-road rides for me with no issue. It would be nice if a few extra O-rings were provided in case they wear out or are damaged.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-4.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-4.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-4.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-4.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-4.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Designs-Stash-Review-4.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Tool</h3>\n<p>The RCX uses a smaller, more traditional multi-tool compared to the ratchet. Having an arrangement of hex bits from 2mm-6mm and a flat head screwdriver instead of a Phillips. There is also a small machined piece to use as a spoke wrench or to remove a valve core. I like the construction of the tool as the rotating bits can be adjusted with (another) single tool, unlike needing two hexes for most multi-tools. Travis shared this predicament and wrote a whole <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/why-bicycle-multi-tools-wont-stay-tight-and-how-to-fix-it/\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> about the subject.</p>\n<p>Notably, the tool is missing an 8mm hex, which is a big bummer. This can be remedied with something as simple as an <a href=\"https://wabicycles.com/products/wabi-8mm-hex-wrench-adaptor\" target=\"_blank\">adaptor</a>, but that makes the cool aspect of the self-contained tool in your steerer fall apart. The flat head is a bit odd, but most Phillips screws could probably still be adjusted in a pinch. If this tool had a Phillips and 8mm bit, I think it would have stolen the spot of my favorite mini multi-tool. It’s so close.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No need to thread your steerer</li>\n<li>O-ring tool carrier head securely</li>\n<li>Compression plug compatibility works with many forks</li>\n<li>No steerer sizing limit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No 8mm hex</li>\n<li>No spare O-rings provided</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Cover-Photo.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Cover-Photo.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Cover-Photo.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Cover-Photo.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Granite-Cover-Photo.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the Granite Design Stash system. The installation of the RT and RCX was mostly simple and straightforward. Multi-tools will always be limited as they are meant for in-the-field service. But neither of the reviewed tools is without fault: the ratchet tool lacks reach for certain applications, and the RCX has a limited number of bits.</p>\n<p>The Stash RT feels more premium with its rotating cover and spring-loaded tool carrier. With a slightly wider array of bits, it is possible to ratchet in two directions. The tool carrier needs a very long bolt and a lower cap, which makes the system more cumbersome. If you want the same smaller multi-tool as the RCX, it is available with the standard<a href=\"https://granite-design.com/collections/stash-system/products/stash-multitool\" target=\"_blank\"> Stash</a> model.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed the simplicity of the RCX system, and I think its compression plug compatibility will allow them to be installed on a wider array of bikes. If the multi-tool had an 8mm hex, I think this system would be a home run.</p>\n<p>Granite Designs has a suite of cool tools and ways to strap stuff to your bike; check out their <a href=\"https://granite-design.com/\">website</a> for all the goodies.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/granite-designs-stash-review/\">Granite Designs Stash RT and RCX Multi-Tool Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"fcc2c64535cb93d597b24e83ffe231e5badf74dddb0fe8c24977788d197082dc","category":"Cycling"}
