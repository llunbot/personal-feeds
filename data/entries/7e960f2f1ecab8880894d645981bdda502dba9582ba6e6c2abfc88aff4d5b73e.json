My favorite was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/28/23702274/microsoft-edge-developer-bing-ai-chatbot-advertisement-google-bard\">this one</a> from last year: when users opened a tab for “bard.google.com”, Edge inserted an ad <em>in the tab bar</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/28/23702274/microsoft-edge-developer-bing-ai-chatbot-advertisement-google-bard\">encouraging the user to “Compare answers with the AI-powered new Bing”</a>. Ads in the tab bar, jeebus.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also a longstanding practice where if you search for “Chrome” or “Chrome download”, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813733/microsoft-windows-edge-download-chrome-prompts\">Edge shows a special pop-up</a> encouraging you to stick with it rather than switch. Google pulls a similar thing, using popups across its web properties to encourage users of other browsers — <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7746732?sortBy=rank\">perhaps especially Safari</a>, unsurprisingly, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-seeks-defend-googles-billion-dollar-payments-search-case-2024-12-24/\">considering how much money they pay Apple each year</a> — to switch to Chrome, often with the implication that Google recommends switching for security reasons, not financial ones.</p>\n\n<p>As a comparison, the best search engine in the world, <a href=\"https://kagi.com/\">Kagi</a>, is so scrupulous that <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/orion-kagi-search-results-2025-01-09.pdf\">they don’t screw with the order of the results for the search term “Orion”</a>, even though that’s <a href=\"https://kagi.com/orion/\">the name of their own web browser</a>. (If you missed it over the holidays, I had <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2024/12/24/ep-416\">a great interview with Kagi founder Vlad Prelovac on The Talk Show</a> last month.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/09/microsofts-recent-history-of-dirty-tricks-with-edge\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e960f2f1ecab8880894d645981bdda502dba9582ba6e6c2abfc88aff4d5b73e","category":"Tech"}
