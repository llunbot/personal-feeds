Apple says it pairs well with the refreshed Nike Sport Loop, which features the Nike Swoosh and logo text incorporated into the weave of the band. Meanwhile, the Hermes version has numbers that change hour by hour.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/E_QzlNpXsAAg_EF.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple says that the price of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌‌ starts at $399 and the new model will be available later this fall.
