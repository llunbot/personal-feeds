But in one slab of such trackways, scientists uncovered something more: the trace of an animal’s tail as it dragged across the ground. Strikingly, these tail prints come complete with scale impressions—at 300 million years old, they’re among the earliest scale impressions we have.</p>\n<p>This may seem small, but it shows us that some of the hardened skin structures necessary for our ancestors to survive on land had evolved much earlier than previously suspected. A <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0041\">paper</a> published in Biology Letters this past May describes this discovery in detail.</p>\n<h2>A rare find</h2>\n<p>The particular slab holding these traces was discovered in 2020 at the Piaskowiec Czerwony quarry in Poland. Mining had stopped to enable paleontologists to search the red sandstone rocks for fossils. Gabriela Calábková described climbing upon “a huge pile of rubble” only to discover a sizable slab of fossil tracks at the very top. There, among one set of footprints, was something new.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033803#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033803&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeanne Timmons","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58da4361b12311aa3995ae18bd93dcc4b6d47564f901c9e0b9ea42f865febb1a","category":"Tech"}
