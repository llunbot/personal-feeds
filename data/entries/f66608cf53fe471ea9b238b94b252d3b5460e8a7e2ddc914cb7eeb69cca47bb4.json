They often have billions of individual computational nodes and huge numbers of connections among them. All of that means lots of trips back and forth to memory and a whole lot of power use to make that happen. And the problem is likely to get worse.</p>\n<p>One way to potentially avoid this is to mix memory and processing. Both IBM and Intel have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/08/ibm-researchers-make-a-chip-full-of-artificial-neurons/\">made chips</a> that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/understanding-neuromorphic-computing-and-why-intels-excited-about-it/2/\">equip individual neurons</a> with all the memory they need to perform their functions. An alternative is to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/training-a-neural-network-in-phase-change-memory-beats-gpus/\">perform operations in memory</a>, an approach that has been demonstrated with phase-change memory.</p>\n<p>Now, IBM has followed up on its earlier demonstration by building a phase-change chip that's much closer to a functional AI processor. In a paper released on Wednesday by Nature, the company shows that its hardware can perform speech recognition with reasonable accuracy and a much lower energy footprint.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962669#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962669&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f66608cf53fe471ea9b238b94b252d3b5460e8a7e2ddc914cb7eeb69cca47bb4","category":"Tech"}
