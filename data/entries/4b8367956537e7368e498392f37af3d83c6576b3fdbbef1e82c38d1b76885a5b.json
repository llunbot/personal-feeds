{"title":"Giro d'Italia 2023 route: full details of the 106th Corsa Rosa","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/giro-ditalia-route","date":1682433000000,"content":"\n      \n<p>When the route for the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia\">Giro d'Italia</a> was unveiled, the most striking thing about it was the drastic increase in time trialling.</p>\n<p><span>Overall, there will be three time trials, with a flat 18.4km opening stage in Abruzzo, an 18.6km mountain time trial in Friuli-Venezia Giulia on the penultimate stage, and a lengthy 33.6km ITT in Emilia Romagna at the end of the first week. Added all together, that makes for a total of 70.6 time trialling kilometres — the most of any Giro since the 2013 edition, and almost three times as many as at last year’s. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The trend in recent seasons has been for less time trialling to be included in Grand Tours, so this significant reversal will give an entirely different crop of riders the chance to fight for the <em>maglia rosa</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span>While even the toughest mountain top finishes often see the top GC contenders separated by a matter of seconds, those who also specialise against the clock have the opportunity to make gains in these time trial stages that could be decisive in determining the fate of the pink jersey. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Giro d'Italia 2023 map and route</span></h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/UR2QxzmeFaYxIgr2rwTt_181022-111229_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666256489\" alt />Of course, this being the Giro d’Italia, there’s still plenty of climbing to account for. Summit finishes in the Apennines, the Alps and the Dolomites provide plenty of opportunities for climbers to attack, and those who aren’t confident with their time trialling will be keen to use every opportunity to make gains where the terrain suits them. The final week, in particular, looks like it'll provide us with fireworks.</span></p>\n<p><span>Prior to that, the riders will make their way gradually up north through the country following the Grande Partenza in Abruzzo. There will be plenty of stages for the sprinters along the way, but perhaps not as many as it might seem at first glance — many of the days with flat finales feature a substantial amount of climbing earlier on, which could play into the hands of breakaways. </span></p>\n<p><span>And for the first time since 2018, the Giro will finish in the nation’s capital of Rome, having alternated between Milan and Verona in recent years.</span></p>\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage one: Fossacesia <strong>&gt;</strong> Ortona, 18.4km</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/NxQXpS8ohUNlNTlJMjC1_141022-122640_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666254609\" alt /></span></p>\n\n<p><span>The first maglia rosa of the 2023 edition will be worn by whichever time triallist can complete this mostly flat (apart from an uphill final kilometre) 18km course along the Abruzzo coastline the quickest.</span></p>\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage two: Teramo &gt; San Salvo, 204km</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/5QMxTCcHZUo00OzTVLG2_141022-123153_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666254716\" alt />A few small hills during the opening half of the first road stage of the Giro are unlikely to be enough to prevent a bunch sprint on the San Salvo promenade.</p>\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage three: <span>Vasto</span> &gt; Melfi, 210km</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CvqhOdPj8NAUz9T4zyCd_141022-123337_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666254797\" alt /></span></p>\n<p><span>Whether the sprinters can survive the climbs later in the stage will decide if stage three will finish in another bunch sprint. The final climbs come with the final 35km of racing, so it may provide an opportunity for the puncheurs if they can break away.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage four: Venosa<span> </span>&gt; Lago Laceno, 184km</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/vgGtqtLFoBxKxu0eJMcL_141022-123532_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666254868\" alt />The riders will get a tastes of what is to come as they head for the first stage in the Apennines. Stage four undulates throughout the day and includes three classified climbs as well as a near-summit finish at Lago Laceno. </p>\n\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage five: Atripalda<span> </span>&gt; Salerno, 172km</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/qKFYO0Y7DIZoMe9FmtNX_141022-123827_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666255179\" alt />A front-loaded parcours with rolling roads during its first half, there’s a chance for an early breakaway to build a big enough lead to make it to the finish. </span></p>\n\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage six: Napoli<span> </span>&gt; Napoli, 156km</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/nv8hwjRSS1LCg8R4tD4C_141022-124018_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666255297\" alt />The shortest road stage of the race (aside from the finale in Rome) features some tough climbing in its first half, but a flat final 50km to the finish in Napoli.</p>\n\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage<span> seven</span>: Capua<span> </span>&gt; Gran Sasso d'Italia, 218km</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/0WWtj8m3rRP2ahfwQVSA_141022-124218_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666255360\" alt />The first real mountain top finish in the Abruzzo Apennines, stage seven finishes over 2000m above sea level atop the very long Campo Imperatore climb.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage<span> eight</span>: Terni<span> </span>&gt; Fossombrone, 207km</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/wjqvRszWvO3VJJSCNTsy_141022-124510_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666255429\" alt />A series of short, steep climbs inside the final 60km make stage eight one for the puncheurs, and possibly a chance for some more GC action. </span></p>\n\n<h3>Giro d'Italia 2023 - stage<span> nine</span>: Savignano sul Rubicone<span> </span>&gt; Cesena (Technogym Village), 33.6km</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/pkiHQzRePK6DfECagw5O_181022-081328_1024x1024.jpg?v=1666255498\" alt />The first week comes to an end with one of the most important stages of the race, a 33.6km individual time trial in Emilia-Romagna.
