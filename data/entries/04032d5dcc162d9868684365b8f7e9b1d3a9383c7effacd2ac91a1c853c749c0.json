The leaker provided no other information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been several rumors suggesting that a foldable ‌iPad‌ or MacBook is in the works. Previous rumors have been unclear on whether the upcoming foldable device will be an ‌iPad‌ or a Mac, but either is feasible depending on what operating system Apple opts to go with. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for under-display Face ID, it has been rumored for future iPhones for several years, but has so far failed to materialize. Today's rumor is the first to mention under-display Face ID in the context of Apple's foldable plans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to analyst firm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/foldable-ipad-pro-2027-launch/\">Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC)</a>, Apple is planning to launch an 18.8-inch foldable iPad Pro with an OLED display in 2027. Separately, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/\">supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has claimed LG aims to begin mass production of display panels for a MacBook with a 20.2-inch or an 18.8-inch foldable screen in the fourth quarter of 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA December report by <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/\">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> has also claimed that Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's \"intended to serve as a laptop\" and that would unfold to be about 19 inches in size. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has also spoken of a foldable ‌iPad in development‌, suggesting that the \"giant\" tablet would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/foldable-ipad-likely-set-for-2028-launch/\">launch in 2028</a>. According to Gurman, Apple does not want the upcoming foldable device to have a crease, instead appearing as a single piece of glass. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also said to be working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">book-style foldable iPhone</a> with a crease-free display for release late next year. Rather than feature Face ID, the foldable iPhone will reportedly integrate Touch ID into a side button, similar to recent iPad Air and iPad mini models, due to internal space constraints.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/foldable-ipad-pro-under-display-face-id/\">Apple's Foldable iPad Pro Prototype Features Under-Display Face ID</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-foldable-ipad-pro-prototype-features-under-display-face-id.2452679/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"04032d5dcc162d9868684365b8f7e9b1d3a9383c7effacd2ac91a1c853c749c0","category":"Apple"}
