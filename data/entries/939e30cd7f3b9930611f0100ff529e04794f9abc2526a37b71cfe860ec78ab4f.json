He picked Cena's Peacemaker, since he felt audiences never got the chance to get to know the character in the film—where, it must be said, he does some Very Bad Things, even for a member of the Suicide Squad. Gunn wanted to make Peacemaker less irredeemable. HBO Max was sufficiently impressed with Gunn's take that it ordered <em>Peacemaker</em> straight to series.</p>\n<p>The eight-episode series is set after the events of <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, specifically after the post-credits scene, in which we learned that Peacemaker had survived what had appeared to be a fatal shooting. The first teaser dropped in October, showing Peacemaker (aka Christopher Smith) being recruited by Clemson Murn (Chukwudi Iwuji) for another mission in order to avoid going back to prison.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817942#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817942&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"939e30cd7f3b9930611f0100ff529e04794f9abc2526a37b71cfe860ec78ab4f","category":"Tech"}
