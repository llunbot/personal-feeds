These failures impacted \"hundreds of thousands of Apple Card users,\" according to the agency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been ordered to pay a $25 million fine, which will go to the CFPB's victims relief fund, while Goldman Sachs is required to pay at least $19.8 million in redress to impacted consumers and a $45 million fine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a statement shared with <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said it \"strongly disagree[s] with the CFPB's characterization of Apple's conduct.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Apple is committed to providing consumers with fair and transparent financial products,\" an Apple spokesperson said. \"Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards available, and was specifically designed to support users' financial health. Upon learning about these inadvertent issues years ago, Apple worked closely with Goldman Sachs to quickly address them and help impacted customers. While we strongly disagree with the CFPB's characterization of Appleâ€™s conduct, we have aligned with them on an agreement. We look forward to continuing to deliver a great experience for our Apple Card customers.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-responds-to-apple-card-fine/\">Apple Responds After Being Fined Alongside Goldman Sachs for Alleged 'Apple Card Failures'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-responds-after-being-fined-alongside-goldman-sachs-for-alleged-apple-card-failures.2440776/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e8619c0ca1deefbc1e39f307b5798195b2a64d309ae4359c8cdb302c2c514d0","category":"Apple"}
