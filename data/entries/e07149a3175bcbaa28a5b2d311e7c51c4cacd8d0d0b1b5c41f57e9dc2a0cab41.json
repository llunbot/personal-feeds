Now, it seems, the team is to benefit from a dedicated downhill bike that runs an all-new suspension design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, that 200mm fork is sporting some not-so-sneaky RockShox Blackbox decals, suggesting there’s some prototype stuff going on inside this Boxxer. <em>More on that down below.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot.jpg\" alt=\"norco dh bike prototype 6-bar linkage design drive side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>It is possible this dropout design could allow the team to play around with different rear-center lengths.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bidding farewell to the linkage-driven single-pivot of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/soc18-all-new-norco-aurum-hsp-dh-carbon-mountain-bike-search-gravel-bike-drops-in/\" target=\"_blank\">Aurum HSP</a>, and the four-bar linkage of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2022-norco-range-enduro-bike-rocks-high-virtual-pivot-suspension-on-29-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Norco Range</a>, the as-of-yet un-named prototype sees a 6-bar linkage design, wherein the main pivot is positioned high on the seat tube. Indeed, Norco is sticking with a high-pivot, seemingly very happy with the majority rearward axle path it delivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2401\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley.jpg\" alt=\"norco prototype downhill bike 6-bar linkage high pivot 22tooth idler pulley\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-1365x2048.jpg 1365w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It does of course mean that an idler pulley is required to route the chain close to that main pivot, dissociating conflicting forces from the drivetrain and suspension – <em>i.e.</em>, reducing <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aasq-85-what-is-pedal-kick-back-full-suspension-chain-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">pedal kickback</a>. On the prototype, an idler pulley positioned concentric to the pivot, is utilized – with 22 teeth, it is very large by current industry standards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lal-bikes-supre-drive-finds-home-on-all-new-nicolai-nucleon-16/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolai Nucleon 16</a> with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lal-bikes-supre-drive-splits-the-traditional-derailleur-for-high-pivot-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Lal Bikes Supre Drive</a> runs an idler pulley this big, in a presumed bid to reduce friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position.jpg\" alt=\"norco dh bike 2023 aluminum prototype frame 6-bar design coil shock positioning\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-DH-Bike-2023-aluminum-prototype-frame-shock-position-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view.jpg\" alt=\"norco dh bike 6-bar linkage non drive side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-nds-view-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Norco prototype’s linkage, we count seven pivots, if you include the one on the short yoke (dark blue) that is driving the shock. The shock is positioned very low in the frame, driven by that yoke that is itself driven by a link (orange) that will rotate counter-clockwise about the main pivot as the bike is pushed through its rear wheel travel. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"norco prototype downhill bike 6-bar linkage layout pivot locations\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-6-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-with-yoke.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Image annotated by Cory Benson – Bikerumor.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Connected to that link, about two thirds of the way up its length, is a bar (pink) that couples the movement of the lower linkage (blue) to the orange link. It moves through space as the lower linkage (which importantly is <em>not</em> articulating about a BB concentric pivot) extends away from the front triangle to extend the bike’s effective rear-center length as it is pushed through its travel. And, let’s not forget there is a pivot on the chainstay, as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount.jpg\" alt=\"norco prototype downhill bike 6-bar linkage flip-chip upper shock mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-prototype-downhill-bike-alloy-frame-flip-chip-upper-shock-mount-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>A flip-chip at the upper shock mount will allow for some adjustment.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I shan’t be commenting on what kind of kinematic is likely to arise from such a layout, but it seems to work nicely with both air and coil shocks. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lccruzin/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucas Cruz</a> just won the Canadian National Champs aboard this prototype Norco, sprung by a RockShox air shock running a very, very large air can – as compared to the modestly-sized air can we see on the Super Deluxe Ultimate Air Shocks, that is. Meanwhile, 2nd place <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/markwallacebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Wallace</a>‘s bike was coil-sprung. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also noteworthy is that a Norco Development Engineer involved in the creation of this bike, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kirkmcdowall/\" target=\"_blank\">Kirk McDowall</a>, filled third place on that same podium.
