This prevents excessive lateral movement and guides the alignment of every link it’s in contact with.</p>\n<p>This means every link has a secure connection to the chainring and should prevent dropped chains from disrupting your ride.</p>\n<h2>Are there any drawbacks?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bold Unplugged Ultimate full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Bold Unplugged Ultimate - 20\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There is little reason not to run a narrow-wide chainring on a 1x drivetrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Narrow-wide chainrings vastly improve chain retention without creating excess drag.</p>\n<p>However, due to the tight fit between the chainring teeth and the chain links, it’s important to make sure you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-clean-a-bike-chain/\">clean your chain</a> and chainring. Grime and dirt can prevent the system from working properly or increase chain wear.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to keep on top of chainring wear because worn tooth profiles on a narrow-wide chainring can have a detrimental effect on the system’s chain retention.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a worn tooth profile can lead to chain suck, where the chain fails to disengage from the chainring at the end of the rotation (though this is also true of conventional chainrings).</p>\n<h2>Narrow-wide chainring sizes</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RATIO_CHAINRING_SHOOT-19\" title=\"RATIO_CHAINRING_SHOOT-19\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Narrow-wide chainrings are available in a range of sizes to suit different preferences.

These are designed to fit specific chains from different manufacturers.</p>\n<p>Narrow-wide chainrings are also available to suit different ‘speed’ drivetrains. For example, a 9-speed chain is wider than a modern 12-speed chain, so it requires a different profile of narrow-wide teeth for the best performance possible.</p>\n<h2>Narrow-wide chainring fitting standards</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Tero X 4.0 city urban off-road eBike\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Tero X 4.0 - 06\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Note the four bolts attaching the chainring to the crank spider.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Chainrings are mounted to a crankset in two ways.</p>\n<p>The first is via a spider, which is usually (but not always) an integral part of the crank. The spider is another name for the arms that protrude from the centre of a cransket.</p>\n<p>Most modern road and mountain bike crank arms have four-arm spiders. Older models will generally have five arms.</p>\n<p>These arms differ in size and determine the size of chainring you can fit to your crankset. The spacing between the mounting holes on these arms is called the ‘Bolt Circle Diameter’. This is the diameter of an imaginary circle drawn through the centre of all the bolts on your chainring.</p>\n<p>Modern Shimano mountain bike crank arms have an asymmetrical 64mm BCD. Older cranks may have a 5-arm 110mm or 58mm BCD.</p>\n<p>Some chainrings will have their BCD engraved on them, which makes finding a replacement easy.</p>\n<p>If you don’t know the BCD of your four- or five-bolt chainring, you will have to measure it yourself – we recommend Sheldon Brown’s guide on <a href=\"https://www.sheldonbrown.com/measure-bcd.html\" target=\"_blank\">how to measure BCD</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Changing a SRAM direct-mount chainring\" title=\"Change Direct Mount Chainring 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are two mounting standards for narrow-wide chainrings – seen here is a SRAM direct-mount chainring.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Direct-mount cranksets do without the spider, with the chainring instead mounting onto a usually splined pattern on the crankset.</p>\n<p>Direct-mount cranksets are used by brands such as SRAM, Shimano, Race Face and others.</p>\n<p>Generally, direct-mount cranksets are lighter than their spider counterparts. They also allow for smaller chainring sizes.</p>\n<p>With direct-mount cranksets, the crank-to-chainring interface is often specific to a brand. So, if you’re looking for a narrow-wide chainring for a direct-mount crankset, you will have to make sure your new chainring is compatible with the splines and grooves of the crank.</p>\n<p>This can limit the options available to you, depending on how many chainrings fit your specific crankset.</p>\n<p>Note that some cranksets (eg, Middleburn) offer the option of mounting a direct-mount spider, onto which different chainrings can be mounted.</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Finlay Anderson","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c7332c17f22049dce5d4a581dd53f99878c1b4ebbb888827063d1ddb036aa1ac","category":"Cycling"}
