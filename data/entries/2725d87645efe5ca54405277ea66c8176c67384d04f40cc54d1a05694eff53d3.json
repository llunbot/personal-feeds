However, the situation escalated quickly on Wednesday as word spread of a stomach bug going around the Gulf Coast school. A spokesperson for the county school district <a href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2024/02/gastrointestinal-outbreak-probe-shutters-alabama-school-through-friday-with-nearly-800-students-absent.html\">told AL.com</a> that 773 students and 50 staff were absent Wednesday. It's unclear how many of the absences were due to sickness or precaution.</p>\n<p>Health officials are now investigating the cause of the gastrointestinal outbreak, collecting specimens for testing. So far, officials are working under the assumption that it is norovirus, a highly infectious gastrointestinal bug that can survive hand sanitizer and transmit easily from surfaces, food, and water. The symptoms of the unidentified illness align with norovirus: vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and nausea.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007210#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007210&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2725d87645efe5ca54405277ea66c8176c67384d04f40cc54d1a05694eff53d3","category":"Tech"}
