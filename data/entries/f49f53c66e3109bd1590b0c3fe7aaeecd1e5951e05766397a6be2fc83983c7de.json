The option can be activated using the key shortcut Shift-Command-F, and is aimed at making it easier to narrow down a search in particularly long notes. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, Things now recognizes a wide range of commonly used Markdown syntax, making it easier to structure and style notes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/3-Markdown-on-iOS.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, Things Cloud \"Fractus\" is a new way of syncing text. Until now, each time the user modified a note – say to insert or remove a few words – the entire note would be synced again across all their devices. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith Things Cloud \"Fractus\", however, only the fragments of text that are modified get synced, which should improve the speed and efficiency of the sync, and allow for smarter resolution of conflicts. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThings 3.14 can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a> for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904280696?ls=1&amp;mt=12\">$49.99</a> and from the iOS <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
