As the Paris Olympics slowly draws to a close, the focus for the women’s peloton moves to the biggest stage race of the year and the fight for the coveted yellow jersey. In this year’s Tour, defending champion Demi Vollering stands out as the overwhelming favourite for the general classification victory, but there are plenty of riders hot on her heels who will want to pose a challenge to the SD Worx-Protime rider.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The duo of Giro d’Italia Donne winner Elisa Longo-Borghini and her younger teammate Gaia Realini make a formidable pairing for Lidl-Trek, while </span><span>Kasia Niewiadoma</span><span> and Neve Bradbury will want to ensure that Canyon//SRAM are also key contenders in the GC fight. Juliette Labous of dsm-Firmenich-PostNL and Évita Muzic of FDJ-Suez have the hopes of the French public on their shoulders for a home win in their nation’s biggest race, while veteran climber Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio is dreaming of turning a challenging season around for AG Insurance-Soudal Team.</span></p>\n<p><span>We can expect fireworks all the way through the eight-day race from Rotterdam to the iconic finish on Alpe d’Huez and surprises are always possible in the Tour. With this in mind, we look at the outstanding candidates for yellow in this year’s Tour de France Femmes.</span></p>\n<h3>Demi Vollering</h3>\n<p><span>There was simply no one who could challenge SD Worx-Protime’s superstar general classification leader in last year’s Tour de France Femmes as she rode away from her rivals on the Col du Tourmalet. Demi Vollering is currently the unrivalled favourite to win a second yellow jersey in 2024, with victories at the Tour de Romandie, La Vuelta Femenina, Itzulia Women, Vuelta a Burgos and Tour de Suisse to her name already this season. The Dutch rider's recent 5th place at the time trial in the Olympic Games is a good sign that she is building her form nicely ahead of the Tour – it’s hard to imagine a scenario whereby Vollering isn’t the dominant rider in this year’s race.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20230730TDFFAZ1084-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723204381\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image: ASO/Charly Lopez</span></em></p>\n<p><span>SD Worx-Protime also will bring a strong squad to support Vollering, with Niamh Fisher-Black expected to be crucial when the race heads into the mountains and the likes of Mischa Bredewold and Christine Majerus essential for protecting Vollering in the opening Dutch stages. However, the team does have split ambitions with Lorena Wiebes going for sprint victories on flat stages, so it will be important for them to balance this with ensuring Vollering is getting all the support she needs from a general classification standpoint. </span></p>\n<p><span>There has also been murmurings of unrest within SD Worx this season surrounding Vollering’s expected departure from the team at the end of this year – this will need to be quashed to allow the riders to focus on the task in hand of winning a yellow jersey. However, on the long slopes of Alpe d’Huez, there’s no doubt that Vollering’s legs will do the talking, she’s proven her climbing ability with with wins atop Lagos de Covadonga and Mirador de Peñas Llanas at La Vuelta Femenina, Lagunas de Neila at Vuelta a Burgos and at Torgon at the Tour de Romandie.</span></p>\n<h3>Kasia Niewiadoma</h3>\n<p><span>2024 will see Kasia Niewiadoma’s third participation in the Tour de France Femmes and she has finished in third place in both 2022 and 2023. The Canyon//SRAM rider is a formidable racer, she has always proved herself as unafraid to attack and take risks, notably breaking away from Annemiek van Vleuten and Demi Vollering on the Queen stage in 2022 while the Dutch duo watched each other – she came close to taking the stage win herself. Niewiadoma has worked on her weaknesses since then, spending plenty of time at altitude to improve her performances in the high mountains as well as focusing on time trials to ensure that she doesn’t risk losing time in stages against the clock.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20240417FWF1152-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723204272\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image: ASO/Billy Ceusters</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The Polish rider has had a good season so far, breaking her five-year winless streak at Flèche Wallonne Féminine this spring when she out climbed Vollering on the famous Mur du Huy. This victory undoubtedly would have given Niewiadoma confidence that she does have the ability to beat SD Worx when she’s on her best day, and she’ll be hoping for more of them as she begins her 2024 Tour de France campaign. Niewiadoma won’t be worried about the technical opening stages in the Netherlands and is able to thrive in a chaotic peloton, so it could all come down to her climbing legs when the race begins to head to the hills.</span></p>\n<p><span>Canyon//SRAM brings a solid line-up to the Tour de France which includes Neve Bradbury who took a surprise win in the Giro d'Italia Women Blockhaus stage and third overall earlier this year. Time trial world champion Chloé Dygert is a rider who will be useful for protecting Niewiadoma in the flatter stages, while Elise Chabbey, Soraya Paladin, Alice Towers, and Agnieszka Skalniak-Sójka complete the team.</span></p>\n<h3>Elisa Longo Borghini</h3>\n<p><span>Elisa Longo Borghini has a turbulent relationship with the Tour de France Femmes. In 2022, the Lidl-Trek rider started the race with some extremely strong performances in the opening days until the high mountains saw her tumble out of contention for the general classification. The following year, she was forced to abandon ahead of stage 7 due to a skin infection and was unable to contest the yellow jersey fight. In 2024, however, Longo-Borghini seems to have taken some big steps forwards when it comes to stage racing, recently winning the Giro d’Italia Women on home soil against a tough challenge from Lotte Kopecky a few months ago.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/MP104561_1024x1024-ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-converter_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723204194\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image: RCS</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The 32-year-old will have plenty of opportunities at the Tour de France Femmes for stage victories as well as in the general classification – she is well suited to the punchy, hilly stages in the Netherlands. It could be that her Lidl-Trek team will instruct Longo-Borghini to go solely for stage wins and relinquish the GC challenge, especially as they have Gaia Realini who is a formidable climber expected to flourish on Alpe d’Huez. Realini could struggle in the flatter stages though, especially if there are crosswinds, so it remains to be seen what the team’s strategy will be.</span></p>\n<p><span>Based off her previous climbing performances, it’s hard to imagine Longo Borghini will be able to keep up with the likes of Vollering and Niewiadoma in the mountains, so Lidl-Trek may need to take a creative approach to the race, attacking earlier on to put other GC contenders in danger before they reach the mountain stages. With Lucinda Brand, Shirin van Anrooij, Brodie Chapman and Lizzie Deignan completing their line-up, the American team certainly has all the tools to make the Tour de France Femmes an aggressive race.</span></p>\n<h3>Juliette Labous</h3>\n<p><span>When it comes to the French fans, Team dsm-firmenich-PostNL’s Juliette Labous has become a favourite after her strong showing in both editions of the Tour de France Femmes so far. She finished in fourth place in 2022 and backed that up with fifth in 2023. It’s not just in her home race that Labous has shown her climbing ability, either. She took the overall win at the Vuelta a Burgos in 2022 and the summit stage 7 victory atop Passo del Maniva at the Giro d'Italia Women, and secured second place overall at the Giro d’Italia Women in 2023. This season, she finished fourth overall at La Vuelta Femenina, third overall at Itzulia Women, fifth at Tour de Suisse and Giro d'Italia Women, and recently managed a fourth place at the Olympics time trial in Paris.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20240420LBL1093-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723204437\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image: RCS</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Team dsm-firmenich-PostNL have done an impressive job at steadily developing Labous into a general classification contender and, now in her third Tour de France, the Frenchwoman has a serious shot at the podium in her home Grand Tour. Labous has a chance to gain time in the time trial and also will be looking forward to the longer climbs that come later in the week – she’ll be supported by strong climbers like Francesca Barale and have Pfeiffer Georgi as a road captain (Team dsm have long been known for their impressive collective strength and drilled ability to ride as a team.)</span></p>\n<p><span>Similarly to Vollering and SD Worx, however, Labous’ team have split ambitions when it comes to the general classification and individual stage wins. Charlotte Kool will be dreaming of sprint victories and the team will be doing lead-outs for the Dutch rider on the flat days. Labous will need to ensure she stays protected and out of trouble here to avoid losing time before she gets her chance to shine in the mountains.</span></p>\n<h3>Évita Muzic</h3>\n<p><span>FDJ-Suez have been vocal about the fact they are <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-gap-to-sd-worx-is-getting-smaller-fdj-suez-plan-to-be-women-s-cycling-s-new-super-team\">coming into the Tour de France Femmes with two general classification leaders</a> in Évita Muzic and Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig. However, based on their results so far this season, Muzic seems like the most likely of the pairing to be able to pose a real challenge for yellow in the race this year. The French rider beat Demi Vollering on the queen stage of La Vuelta Femenina this year when she dropped the SD Worx rider on the climb to La Laguna Negra. She also finished second overall at Vuelta a Burgos and had a strong fourth place at La Flèche Wallonne. Uttrup Ludwig, on the other hand, has battled with injury this season after crashes and setbacks, so is still on the road to coming back to full fitness ahead of the Tour de France.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20240503LVF3016-Unipublic_CXCLING_d53f1fe3-4b61-4335-a6d5-b6c13c678e39_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723133745\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image: RCS/Unipublic</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Muzic is often able to rise to the occasion on big race days and she has meticulously prepared for this Tour de France after missing out on selection for the Paris Olympics. While she admitted the initial disappointment of this decision, she later added that it meant she has been fully focused on the Tour and won’t be carrying the fatigue of riders who have had a week of Olympic requirements. The 25-year-old has been known to struggle on flat stages and in crosswinds so it will be about her getting through the chaotic days in the Netherlands safely so she can do what she does best on Alpe d’Huez.</span></p>\n<p><span>FDJ-Suez will bring a strong team to help Muzic throughout the race, including Olympic time trial champion Grace Brown who has been clear that she loves to work with and support Muzic in stage races. Riders like Léa Curinier, Amber Kraak and Coralie Demay are also reliable domestiques for Muzic and will be doing their best to ensure that the French rider doesn’t lose any time in the first half of the race.</span></p>\n<p><span><em>Cover image: ASO</em></span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"9065473dbc50f64462a8e796724b57813c1ad24a86364e4915591a03c4f7fa89","category":"Cycling"}
