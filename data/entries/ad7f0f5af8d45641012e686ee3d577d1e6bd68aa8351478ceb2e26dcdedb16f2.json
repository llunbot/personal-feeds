It has a first-generation M1 Max processor but brings top-notch performance with a 10‑core CPU, 32‑core GPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB drive. It also has the same remarkable 16.2-inch ProMotion display, an excellent keyboard, and plenty of ports, including three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI, and an SD card reader. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than the chip, the only differences between the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/546363/14-inch-macbook-pro-m1-pro-review.html\">M1 Max</a> and M2 Max MacBooks are the wireless chip (Wi-Fi 6 versus Wi-Fi 6E), Bluetooth generation (5 versus 5.3), and a newer HDMI port (2 versus 2.1). These might matter if you have a brand-new router or need to hook up high-resolution monitors, but for most people, the savings here will greatly outweigh the features you’re giving up.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ad7f0f5af8d45641012e686ee3d577d1e6bd68aa8351478ceb2e26dcdedb16f2","category":"Apple"}
