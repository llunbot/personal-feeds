It was here that I made some of my first big 3D printing mistakes, mistakes that prompted me to read up on the different kinds of 3D printer filament, what each type of filament is good for, and which types the A1 is (and is not) good at handling as an un-enclosed, bed-slinging printer.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-a-bambu-labs-a1-3d-printer-part-2-upgrades-and-mistakes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-a-bambu-labs-a1-3d-printer-part-2-upgrades-and-mistakes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6e0ad74a3e442580168bb777785404ce577f8924262c18abd6b3280d940ceb3","category":"Tech"}
