The idea is that never charging the ‌iPhone‌ above 80 percent will increase battery longevity, so <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/iphone-80-percent-charging-test/\">we ran a long-term test</a> keeping a daily driver ‌iPhone‌ at that 80 percent limit from September 2023 to now, with no cheating.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" />\r<br />\nBattery health definitely still took a drop over that yearlong period even with the limit engaged, but check out our report for the details and how it compared to other iPhones that didn't use the limit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Seeds Fifth Developer Betas of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 With Apple Intelligence</h2>\r<br />\nApple is continuing work on its first Apple Intelligence operating system updates, issuing a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/apple-seeds-ios-18-1-beta-5/\">fresh round of betas this week for iOS 18.1</a> and other updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThere are quite a few changes and additions in this beta, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ios-18-1-control-center-changes/\">tweaks to Control Center functionality</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ios-18-1-beta-5-selfie-camera-control/\">new Camera Control option</a> to access the front-facing camera, and the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/drag-and-drop-files-iphone-mirroring/\">drag and drop files between iPhone and Mac</a> while using the ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>25 New Features You May Have Missed in watchOS 11</h2>\r<br />\nWhile iOS is the star of the show for each round of operating system updates given the popularity of the ‌iPhone‌, Apple's other platforms also see significant updates most years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/25-Hidden-Features-in-watchOS-11-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThis year is no exception, so we've put together a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/25-new-features-apple-watchos-11/\">list of 25 new features in watchOS 11</a> that you may have missed. They range from new health and fitness features to entirely new apps and brand-new functionality, so be sure to check out the list.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 16's 'Revolutionary' Battery Removal Process Shown in Video</h2>\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ifixit-iphone-16-teardown/\">clever new technology to assist in battery repairs</a>, and that's the ability to use low-voltage electrical current to loosen the adhesive that holds the battery in, allowing a depleted battery to be easily removed and replaced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iFixit-iPhone-16-Battery-Removal.jpg\" width=\"3010\" height=\"1682\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max do not include this technology, instead relying on the traditional stretch-release adhesive to secure their batteries, though the smaller ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-16-pro-teardown-video/\">includes a metal-enclosed battery for the first time</a> rather than a foil-wrapped one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Announces iPhone Driver's Licenses Will Come to These Additional U.S. States</h2>\r<br />\nFollowing through on a previous announcement from Apple, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/iphone-drivers-license-wallet-app-california/\">California last week became the seventh U.S. state</a> to support digital driver's licenses and IDs in Apple Wallet, rolling out its mDL pilot program to iOS. The feature is also currently supported in Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, Ohio, and Hawaii.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-wallet-drivers-license-feature-iPhone-15-pro.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn addition, Apple announced that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/apple-lists-3-more-states-committed-to-wallet-ids/\">Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia have signed on</a> to support the feature. A time frame for those new states is unclear, as it has been several years since other states like Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Utah were announced as planning to support it but have yet to do so.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/sep-26-2024\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/28/top-stories-iphone-16-features/\">Top Stories: iPhone 16 Features, iOS 18.1 Improvements, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-16-features-ios-18-1-improvements-and-more.2438455/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"175b5904ef32380635ce65c414172ccabaa04b84a20e8732667f170bc87455fa","category":"Apple"}
