Kolide has seen cyber insurance premiums go up by 40 percent in just the last two years, and got curious about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What’s driving the increases?</li>\n<li>Who really needs cybersecurity insurance?</li>\n<li>How can the average company reduce their premiums?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What Kolide found was that insurance companies themselves can help get us out of this crisis, by mandating some (pretty basic) security requirements for their customers — things like MFA, endpoint security, and retiring end-of-life software. <a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3Vz6w45\">Read their full report to learn more about their findings</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/30/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8d9475b4207a1bd1091593a6724ef3c0b3339f762d147ec73519ab521bd4a6fc","category":"Tech"}
