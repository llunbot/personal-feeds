It’s a stark reminder that life can be very short and our thoughts go to his family and loved ones. Many fans have been paying tribute by donating to environmental charity Justdiggit, which he championed and raised money for, <a href=\"https://justdiggit.org/news/dedicated-regreening-area-for-gino-mader/\" target=\"_blank\">Justdiggit has pledged to dedicate a regreened area to Mäder</a> with the funds raised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On cyclist.co.uk this week, our own Emma Cole has been valiantly crusading onwards atop her two wheeled steed towards her final destination in Tunisia. Now in Italy, she has given us a few insights into <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-kit-review\" target=\"_blank\">what gear has and hasn’t been working so far</a> as well as how she’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/motivation-on-long-rides\" target=\"_blank\">managing to stay motivated</a> on her epic voyage. The trip looks phenomenal and I am incredibly envious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will has been listening to the new <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/marco-pantani-death-of-a-pirate-podcast-review\" target=\"_blank\">BBC podcast about Marco Pantani</a> and gave us his thoughts, and Sean Meager highlighted the senselessness of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pinless-number-pocket-uci\" target=\"_blank\">the UCI’s quest for a pin-less number system</a> (spoiler: one already exists).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fara-f-road-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fara F/Road</a> got a glowing review as did the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/moots-vamoots-crd-review\" target=\"_blank\">Moots Vamoots CRD</a> – yes, we know the price is eye-watering – and we got the first few in what will be a deluge on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/le-col-cycling-mitts-review\" target=\"_blank\">mitts reviews</a> to come in the next few weeks.

The range is designed for those after premium kit with a selection of bold colour options. I’m a fan of bright jerseys in particular and the Women’s Signature Pro is available in bright orange – as shown here – as well as lilac, blue, brown and black. The jersey has a race fit, with raw cut sleeves and reflective detailing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seamless construction is carried over to the Signature Pro LTD bib shorts which also have soft straps and smooth leg grippers. The bib shorts are made from Canyon’s Push+ technical fabric, which it says has high sweat-wicking properties and is paired with Exteondo’s Urraki chamois for quality comfort for long days in the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gear/clothing/jerseys/canyon-women-s-signature-pro-cycling-jersey/9101984.html?dwvar_9101984_pv_farbe=LC\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon (£121.95)</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out the whole <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gear/signature-pro-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">Signature Collection</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Condor Italia RC frameset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Condor Italia RC disc\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Condor_Italia_RC-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m currently doing a long-term test on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-di2\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano 105 Di2 groupset</a> and Condor kindly lent us this Italia RC to build it on to.

The former World and Olympic Champion has teamed up with Le Col to make the Wiggins collection and this latest addition uses designs inspired by the curved lines of the velodrome where he started his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Women’s Pro Aero jersey uses tripping fabric and a compressive fit, which Le Col says smooths the airflow around the rider and helps reduce drag. The Pro Collection uses work done in collaboration with the Bora-Hansgrohe pro team and aerodynamic experts at McLaren. Does it make me as fast as Sir Bradley Wiggins? I’ll leave that up to your imagination.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy the Wiggins Pro Aero jersey from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=15692&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flecol.cc%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-le-col-by-wiggins-pro-aero-jersey%3Fvariant%3D40091501625407\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col (£160)</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out the whole <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=15692&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flecol.cc%2Fcollections%2Fle-col-by-wiggins\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col by Wiggins collection</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Posedla saddle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Posedla Joyseat saddle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Posedla_joyseat_saddle-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever wanted a saddle that was specifically tailored just to you and your bum? Well Posedla can do just that for you with the world’s first 3D-printed made-to-measure saddle. You start by filling out a brief questionnaire, explaining your ride style, mileage etc to create a user profile, and this informs the build and shape of the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fun part is sitting on the imprint box to get a bespoke outline of your behind, which Posedla then uses to create a 3D-printed upper tailored to you. The TPU padding sits on a carbon shell and rails, all of which Posedla says culminates in a ride that has ‘no pressure, just joy’. A perfect excuse to not lend your nice bike to anyone, eh?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Configure now at <a href=\"https://posedla.com/en-uk\" target=\"_blank\">Posedla</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: Feel Good Club Instagram</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COYbu8QDc6b/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COYbu8QDc6b/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Feel Good Club.

Life can be difficult, the world can feel dark and social media can often be a place of comparison or jealousy, so to have a dedicated pocket of positivity on a platform is a real breath of fresh air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite posts are the ‘Sunday Reminders’, which feature several different thoughts and, without fail, there’s always one that resonates and makes me feel a little bit better. It might sound silly but don’t knock it till you try it – it’s a genuinely lovely space and couldn’t we all do with a little more brightness in our lives?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wearefeelgoodclub/\" target=\"_blank\">Feel Good Club Instagram</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/CYCLIST\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter-970x485.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter-970x485.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter-300x150.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter-768x384.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter-360x180.jpg 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter-750x375.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter-1140x570.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/cyclist-survey-newsletter.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>As a loyal reader of <em>Cyclist</em>, we value your opinion</strong>.
