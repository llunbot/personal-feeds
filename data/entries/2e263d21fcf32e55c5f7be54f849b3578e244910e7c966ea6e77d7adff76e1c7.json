Obviously, robots can be made that are stronger, faster, and better than humans, but do you think there is a limit to how much better we can make them?</p>\n<p>Thanks to the ongoing developments in material science and soft robotics, scientists are now developing new technologies that could allow <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/sick-of-picking-up-toys-dysons-future-robots-want-to-do-it-for-you/\">future robots</a> to push the limits of non-human biology. For instance, a team of researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder recently developed a material that could give rise to soft robots capable of jumping 200 times above their own thickness. Grasshoppers, one of the most astonishing leapers on Earth, can leap into the air only up to 20 times their body lengths.</p>\n<p>Despite outperforming the insects, the researchers behind the rubber-like jumping material say they took their inspiration from grasshoppers. Similar to the insect, the material stores large amounts of energy in the area and then releases it all at once while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/05/mits-cheetah-robot-can-now-autonomously-detect-and-jump-over-hurdles/\">making a jump</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923423#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923423&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e263d21fcf32e55c5f7be54f849b3578e244910e7c966ea6e77d7adff76e1c7","category":"Tech"}
