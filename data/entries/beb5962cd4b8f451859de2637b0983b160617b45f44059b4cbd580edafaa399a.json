{"title":"The Diamondback Haanjo gravel bike gets an overhaul","link":"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/04/diamondback-haanjo-gravel-bike/","date":1681747795000,"content":"<p><span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/diamondback/\" target=\"_blank\">Diamondback</a> isn’t the first name in modern gravel bikes, which means that their Haanjo gravel bike has flown under the radar. Those who ended up on one found a well-considered and smartly-equipped gravel bike that exceeded expectations. And now, the Diamondback Haanjo has been updated with suspension and dropper post options, a choice of alloy or carbon frames, and more. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Haanjo lineup is split into three themes over eight different builds. Builds with a ‘C’ at the end denote a carbon frame. ‘EXP’ means the build gets a beefed-up build kit, usually with some combination of wider, knobbier tires, a suspension fork, or a dedicated dropper post. Other builds without these modifiers denote an alloy frame build.</span></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-sideprofile-1340x759.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-sideprofile\" width=\"1340\" height=\"759\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-sideprofile.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-sideprofile.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>The top-spec Haanjo 8C with a carbon frame, carbon wheels, a dropper post, and a Redshift stem.

Not the case here; ‘C’ is for carbon. Helpful updates include an increase in tire clearance to 700c x 45 mm, fork mounts for a double-bolt cage or water bottle, and mounts for a bolt-on toptube bag. This is in addition to the outgoing Haanjo featuring fender mounts, a rear rack mount, and two bottle cage mounts around the bike. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-downtube.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-downtube\" width=\"1500\" height=\"999\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-downtube.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-downtube.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Interestingly, the downtube of the alloy frames eschews a downtube bottle cage mount for a rubber cover for cables and hoses. (Image: Diamondback)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Geometry has been updated as well to fit a wider range of riders. There are five sizes now, going from 47 cm to 59 cm. The 59 cm bike has a considerably longer reach and taller stack that is more befitting a 59 cm frame, but all sizes use more linear reach and stack measurements across the range. Diamondback claims riders five foot, 1 inch to 6 foot, six inches should fit the Haanjo nicely.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-toptube-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-toptube\" width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-toptube.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-8c-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-toptube.jpg?width=190 190w\" /></p>\n<h2><span>Meet the Haanjo Alloy</span></h2>\n<p><span>The Diamondback Haanjo alloy frame has also received updates. Some Haanjo alloy frames receive the same full-carbon fork as the Haanjo Carbon with fork mounts. The alloy frame gets three bottle cage mounts on the frame, a toptube bag mount, and the same 45 mm tire clearance as the carbon model. </span></p>\n<p><span>Geometry is slightly different between the alloy and carbon frames, but they achieve the same goal of offering a linear progression of five sizes, from 47 cm to 59 cm. Alloy frames are said to fit the same rider height range as well.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-3-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Diamondback-Haanjo-3-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips\" width=\"1078\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-3-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-3-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span>The Haanjo 3 features an alloy frame and carbon fork. Expect the build to differ slightly from this image. (Image: Diamondback)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Alloy frames still use a quick-release rear wheel as opposed to the increasingly popular thru axle that makes rear wheel removal and installation a bit more seamless. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note for the frame’s future upgradeability down the line. </span></p>\n<h2><span>Meet Haanjo EXP</span></h2>\n<p><span>The Diamondback Haanjo EXP is frame agnostic and available in both alloy and carbon versions. EXP models receive aforementioned wider and knobbier tires as well as dropper posts. Models like the Haanjo 4 EXP receive a Suntour GVX32 fork with 60mm suspension travel, a 60mm dropper post, 44mm WTB Raddler tires, and a 1x SRAM Apex mechanical drivetrain. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-7C-EXP-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-frontside-custom-bike-1340x1092.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"1092\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-7C-EXP-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-frontside-custom-bike-scaled.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diamondback-Haanjo-7C-EXP-gravel-bike-at-CyclingTips-frontside-custom-bike-scaled.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>A one-off colorway specifically for Sea Otter Classic this year.
