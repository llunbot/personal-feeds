And we’ve found a great one today: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.nike.com/t/apple-watch-series-6-gps-cellular-with-nike-sport-band-44mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-33vP38/MG2J3LLA-060&amp;xcust=1-1-556578-1-393068-9934&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Nike is selling the 44mm Apple Watch with cellular connectivity for $380.78</a>, a savings of nearly $150 when you use the code <strong>CYBER</strong> for an extra 20 percent off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re missing out on a slightly larger screen and faster charging, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/358065/apple-watch-series-7-vs-series-6-design-display-features-price.html\">Apple Watch Series 6</a> has the same health sensors as the Apple Watch Series 7, including ECG, blood-oxygen, and heart rate, as well as fall detection, noise and sleep tracking, and an always-on display. It’s also compatible with every Series 7 band and gets you three months of Apple Fitness+ for free. It even has the same processor as the Series 7 and of course, you’ll be able to install watchOS 8 and receive future updates for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nike version of the Apple Watch is identical to the standard version but has a Nike Sport band and exclusive watch faces as well as the Nike Run Club app pre-installed. It has cellular connectivity, which requires monthly service to operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deal is only available while supplies last and with the 40mm models already sold out, you should probably act fast if you want one.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a9028180582ee43ec25ad72c404c03c0a00d3425877bbb1a0ab8a75de9488cb7","category":"Apple"}
