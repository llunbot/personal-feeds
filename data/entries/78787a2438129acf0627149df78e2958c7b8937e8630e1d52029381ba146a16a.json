In orbital mechanics, this reduction in velocity will bring the apogee, or high point, of the X-37B's orbit closer to Earth.</p>\n<h2>Bleeding energy</h2>\n<p>The Space Force called the aerobraking a \"novel space maneuver\" and said its purpose was to allow the X-37B to \"safely dispose of its service module components in accordance with recognized standards for space debris mitigation.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/the-us-militarys-x-37b-spaceplane-is-preparing-for-a-novel-space-maneuver/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/the-us-militarys-x-37b-spaceplane-is-preparing-for-a-novel-space-maneuver/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78787a2438129acf0627149df78e2958c7b8937e8630e1d52029381ba146a16a","category":"Tech"}
