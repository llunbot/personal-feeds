{"title":"iOS 17's StandBy Mode Turns a Charging iPhone Into a Home Hub","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/ios-17-standby-mode/","date":1686001376000,"content":"Apple in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> is introducing StandBy mode, which is a new display experience designed for a charging <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that's placed in a horizontal orientation. An ‌iPhone‌ in this position is able to display an array of full-screen widgets, turning it into a useful home hub.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/standby-mode-1.jpg\" alt width=\"3070\" height=\"1727\" />\r<br />\nStandBy mode activates automatically on an ‌iPhone‌ running ‌iOS 17‌ that's placed horizontally on a charger. You can see information such as the time, weather, a calendar, music controls, your photos, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can swipe left or right through the available StandBy options, and long press or swipe up/down to customize. With the time, for example, you can choose from an analog view, a digital view, a bubbly font, and a solar view where the background color shifts based on the time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/standby-mode-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nThere are options to add <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> widgets to the main StandBy view, which is the first option you see when activating StandBy. In this view, you can select two widgets to display side-by-side, so you can control your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> products, see your calendar events, keep an eye on the stock market, check on device battery life, see the weather, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf a Live Activity is active, it will be displayed full screen, as will results from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> requests.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt night, StandBy mode will get darker if the room you're in is dark, so that it is not distracting at night while you're sleeping. StandBy mode is akin to Nightstand Mode on the Apple Watch, and it functions in much of the same way. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that having the ‌iPhone‌ continually show information requires an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> or Pro Max with always-on display technology. On other iPhones, a tap is required to see what's on the screen. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/ios-17-standby-mode/\">iOS 17's StandBy Mode Turns a Charging iPhone Into a Home Hub</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17s-standby-mode-turns-a-charging-iphone-into-a-home-hub.2391717/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51826c5990919523bf6057ec297586aaf63f6b35fc230e20abae165211370de7","category":"Apple"}
