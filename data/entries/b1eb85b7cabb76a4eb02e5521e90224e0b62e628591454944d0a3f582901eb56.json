Signing in with an account does get you some benefits, at least if you're a regular user of other Microsoft products like OneDrive, GamePass, or Microsoft 365 (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rip-to-microsoft-office-henceforth-to-be-known-as-microsoft-365/\">aka Office</a>). But if you don't use those services, a lot of what a Microsoft account gets you in Windows 11 is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-11-has-made-the-clean-windows-install-an-oxymoron/\">repeated ads and reminders</a> about signing up for those services. Using Windows with a traditional local account is still extremely possible, but it does require a small amount of know-how beyond just clicking the right buttons.</p>\n\n<p>On the know-how front, Microsoft has taken one more minor, but nevertheless irritating, step away from allowing users to sign in with local accounts. This <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20\">official Microsoft support page</a> walks users with local accounts through the process of signing in to a Microsoft account. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240612104753/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20\">As recently as June 12</a>, that page also included instructions for converting a Microsoft account into a local account. But according to Tom's Hardware and the Internet Wayback Machine, those instructions <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240617103839/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20\">disappeared on or around June 17</a> and haven't been seen since.</p>\n<p>Despite the documentation change, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/\">most of the workarounds</a> for creating a local account still work in both Windows 11 23H2 (the publicly available version of Windows 11 for most PCs) and 24H2 (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/\">available now on Copilot+ PCs</a>, later this fall for everyone else). The easiest way to do it on a PC you just took out of the box is to press Shift+F10 during the setup process to bring up a command prompt window, typing <code>OOBE\\BYPASSNRO</code>, rebooting, and then clicking the \"I don't have Internet\" button when asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033155#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033155&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b1eb85b7cabb76a4eb02e5521e90224e0b62e628591454944d0a3f582901eb56","category":"Tech"}
