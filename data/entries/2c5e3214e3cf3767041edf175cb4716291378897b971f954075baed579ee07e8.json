The unavoidable fact is that the more we use our phones, run apps, and take/edit/share photos and videos, the less time we get between charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re near a power source and have your charger and cable to hand, this is not much of a problem. We’ve even rounded up the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-iphone-fast-charging.html\">best iPhone chargers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2051607/usb-c-charging-cables-iphone-ipad-mac.html\">best iPhone charging cables</a> (or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668656/best-lightning-cables-for-iphone.html\">best Lightning cables</a> for older iPhones) and these should be your go-to when in need of a quick recharge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the launch of the iPhone 12, you can also conveniently charge wirelessly using Apple’s efficient MagSafe technology—and again we have reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MagSafe wireless chargers</a> so you can choose the best one for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re out and about away from a charger, Apple is less help as it no longer makes an iPhone battery case or even MagSafe battery pack. There are still many quality third-party options for battery packs that magnetically clamp to the back of your iPhone, and, yes, we have rounded up the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html\">best MagSafe power banks</a> for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But since the iPhone 11, there hasn’t been an Apple-branded iPhone battery case, and major third parties such as Mophie have also stopped producing them for the latest versions of the iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can still find a host of Chinese battery cases for the iPhone, but our trusted brand of choice is Newdery, which has been making reliable battery cases for the iPhone for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has four iPhone 15 battery cases on offer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF9G84NH?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Newdery 5000mAh Battery Case for iPhone 15 and 15 Pro</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF5BNBDH?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Newdery 10000mAh Battery Case for iPhone 15 and 15 Pro with Qi wireless charging</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NEWDERY-Protective-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable/dp/B0CF8N7KN7?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Newdery 5000mAh Battery Case for iPhone 15 Plus and 15 Pro Max</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NEWDERY-Protective-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable/dp/B0CDGGS2W6?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Newdery 10000mAh Battery Case for iPhone 15 Plus and 15 Pro Max with Qi wireless charging</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The versions with Qi wireless charging allow you to recharge the case’s battery rather than the iPhone itself, which in all versions recharges inside the case. A USB-C connector at the bottom of the case fits into the encased iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Battery case design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the old <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667979/apple-smart-battery-case-for-iphone-11-family-review.html\">Apple Smart Battery Case</a>, the battery section of the Newdery battery cases is a noticeable hump on the back of the case compared to regular cases that usually try to stay as slim as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5000mAh battery case is certainly deeper (0.79 inches / 2cm) than most cases but adds around the same bulk as the old Apple Smart Battery Case. It weighs 4.66oz (132g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10000mAh battery case (1.09 inches / 2.77cm deep) is a bit of a tank with a protrusion and weight that would appall Apple’s designers. That bulk is necessary to fit so much extra battery capacity, however, and the case will still slip into most trouser side pockets, as long as they’re not too tight. It weighs 7.16oz (203g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The slimmer top half of each case is softer and more flexible, allowing for easy insertion of your iPhone into the case. You need to be careful not to be too forceful when attaching or removing the case so that the USB-C connector isn’t bent. We found this to be quite easy compared to some stiffer battery cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any decent phone case should offer robust protection. The Newdery Battery Case feels tough and should offer cover from everyday scratches and scrapes and impact resistance from falls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen lip is enough to rescue the screen from a short drop. The camera ring has no protective ring and the material around it isn’t rigid, but the protruding battery hump should take the brunt of any fall—so we pass the Newdery Battery Case for iPhone 15 as an able protective case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case can be recharged using a USB-C charging cable. The 10000mAh battery cases can also be charged wirelessly. The 5000mAh case cannot be charged wirelessly; you can charge with the phone in the case provided you use a cable, or remove the phone and wirelessly charge it separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four LEDs at the back of the case indicate remaining battery capacity.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Case-1000mAh-bump.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Newdery Battery Case for iPhone 15 10000mAh battery bjump\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Case-1000mAh-bump.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Case-1000mAh-bump.jpg?resize=300%2C115&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Newdery-iPhone-15-Battery-Case-1000mAh-bump.jpg?resize=768%2C295&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"393\" /><figcaption>The 10000mAh Newdery Battery Case for iPhone 15 has a significant battery bump but will charge your fading iPhone over 1.5 times.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Battery case performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While protection is a key requirement for any case, a battery case lives or dies by its recharging performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested the Newdery Battery Case with an iPhone 15 Pro. Our method is to let the phone battery fall to 10%, then recharge it within the case; when the phone is back to 100% we wait until the phone drops to 10% again and then use whatever is left of the battery case juice to start the recharge process again until the battery case can offer no more without itself being recharged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5000mAh Newdery Battery Case gave us 95%, so effectively a full iPhone cycle of recharging, which is probably enough to get you to a power socket and battery relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10000mAh Newdery Battery Case gave us 168%, not twice as much as the 5000mAh case but a decent battery backup for longer periods away from your normal phone recharging points.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alternatives to an iPhone battery case</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t tested any battery cases for iPhone 15 that match the trustworthiness of the Newdery models—so if it’s a battery case you want, then this is our recommendation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can choose a slimmer non-battery case and add a MagSafe battery pack that you clamp to the back of your iPhone only when you need that recharge power. We have tested the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2064242/best-iphone-15-cases.html\">best cases for iPhone 15</a>—choose one that is MagSafe compatible to pair with a magnetic battery pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of a MagSafe battery pack over a battery case is that your iPhone remains slim and protected in a standard case, and you get a much wider choice of case designs by not choosing a battery case. When you need a recharge, you simply clamp the portable power bank to the phone and start recharging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of using a battery case is that it is always with you so you don’t need to remember to keep a separate power bank charged and within reach for when you require it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5000mAh Newdery Battery Case for iPhone 15/15 Pro and for iPhone 15 Plus/Pro Max cost <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF9G84NH?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$29.99</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.amazon.ca/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF9G84NH?th=1&amp;xcust=1-1-2189562-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CA$39.99</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF9G84NH?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">£26.99</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10000mAh Newdery Battery Case costs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF5BNBDH?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$49.99</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.amazon.ca/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF5BNBDH?th=1&amp;xcust=1-1-2189562-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CA$59.99</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/NEWDERY-Charging-Portable-Rechargeable-Protective/dp/B0CF5BNBDH?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">£52.99</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former Apple Smart Battery Case used to cost $129/£129 with just a 1430mAh battery capacity, so the Newdery cases offer a lot more for a lot less cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the cheapest decent non-battery iPhone case will set you back about the same as the 5000mAh Newdery battery case, so the price really is a bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A reliable portable MagSafe power bank also starts at around the same price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Newdery Battery Case for iPhone 15 you get protection and portable backup power at around the same price as either a standard case or a battery pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it adds bulk to your slim iPhone. But when you need extra battery power readily to hand while away from a power source and don’t want the nuisance of also carrying a portable power bank, a protective battery case is a neat and highly functional solution.</p>\n\nMobile Phone Accessories, Power</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2c5e3214e3cf3767041edf175cb4716291378897b971f954075baed579ee07e8","category":"Apple"}
