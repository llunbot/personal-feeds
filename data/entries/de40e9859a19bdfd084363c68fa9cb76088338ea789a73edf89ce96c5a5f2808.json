It now appears that after completing the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors by bringing one to the telephoto camera on next year's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> Pro models, the next significant camera upgrade will be the introduction of a variable aperture.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe information comes from Kuo's latest <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/舜宇光學可望顯著受益於未來兩年apple光學訂單成長與規格升級-216067d2c06f\">post on Medium</a>, where he outlined how upcoming products such as the ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Slim,\" M5 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone‌ 18 will affect Apple supplier Sunny Optical. Kuo believes that Sunny Optical and Luxshare will be the primary and secondary shutter suppliers for the ‌iPhone‌ 18 Pro's new main camera, while the variable aperture lens will be supplied by Sunny Optical and Largan Precision.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro, 15 Pro, and 16 Pro's main cameras feature a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78. A variable aperture on future ‌iPhone‌ models would allow the main camera to control the amount of light entering the lens, allowing it to adjust to different lighting conditions. It also would provide more control over depth of field, enabling sharper focus on subjects or smoother background blur. The ‌iPhone‌ 18 is expected to launch in 2026.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/largan/\">Largan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luxshare/\">Luxshare</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/variable-aperture-rumored-for-iphone-18-pro/\">Variable Aperture Rumored to Bring Major Camera Upgrade to iPhone 18 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/variable-aperture-rumored-to-bring-major-camera-upgrade-to-iphone-18-pro.2442310/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"de40e9859a19bdfd084363c68fa9cb76088338ea789a73edf89ce96c5a5f2808","category":"Apple"}
