The newest version of Mozilla's increasingly privacy-focused browser adds improved print-to-PDF functionality, individual exceptions to HTTPS-only mode, an about:third-party page to help identify compatibility issues introduced by third-party applications, and a new SmartBlock feature that cranks up protection from cross-site tracking while making sure site logins still function.</p>\n<p>There's also a new <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-background-updates-firefox-windows\">background updater</a> for Windows, which allows a small background application to check for, download, and install Firefox updates while the browser is not running.</p>\n<h2>SmartBlock 2.0</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/etsy-login.gif\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          SmartBlock 1.0 prevented using Facebook authentication to log into other websites—for example, Etsy.

The updated version seems to especially target Facebook login, which is increasingly used around the web as a third-party authentication and login tool.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779865#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779865&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6d8458ff855e8fe6a704941f38f27c0bdc8f1084bf7b9218c74edb5ccc2a2a56","category":"Tech"}
