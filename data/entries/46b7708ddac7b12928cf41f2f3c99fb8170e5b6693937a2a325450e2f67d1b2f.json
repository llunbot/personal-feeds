These include \"wellied,\" \"trousered,\" and \"ratarsed,\" to name a few. McIntyre's bit rests on his assertion that pretty much any English word can be modified into a so-called \"drunkonym,\" bolstered by a few handy examples: \"I was utterly gazeboed,\" or \"I am going to get totally and utterly carparked.\"</p>\n<p>It's a clever riff that sparked the interest of two German linguists. Christina Sanchez-Stockhammer of Chemnitz University of Technology and Peter Uhrig of FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg decided to draw on their expertise to test McIntyre's claim that any word in the English language could be modified to mean \"being in a state of high inebriation.\" Given their prevalence, \"It is highly surprising that drunkonyms are still under-researched from a linguistic perspective,\" the authors wrote in their <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/gcla-2023-0007/html\">new paper</a> published in the Yearbook of the German Cognitive Linguistics Association. Bonus: the authors included an extensive appendix of 546 English synonyms for \"drunk,\" drawn from various sources, which makes for entertaining reading.</p>\n<p>There is a long tradition of coming up with colorful expressions for drunkenness in the English language, with the Oxford English Dictionary listing a usage as early as 1382: \"merry,\" meaning \"boisterous or cheerful due to alcohol; slight drunk, tipsy.\" Another OED entry from 1630 lists \"blinde\" (as in blind drunk) as a drunkonym. Even Benjamin Franklin got into the act with his 1737 <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-02-02-0029\"><em>Drinker's Dictionary</em></a>, listing 288 words and phrases for denoting drunkenness. By 1975, there were more than 353 synonyms for \"drunk\" listed in that year's edition of the <em>Dictionary of American Slang</em>. By 1981, linguist Harry Levine <a href=\"https://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~hlevine/Vocabulary-of-Drunkenness-Levine.pdf\">noted 900 terms</a> used as drunkonyms.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004735#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004735&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"46b7708ddac7b12928cf41f2f3c99fb8170e5b6693937a2a325450e2f67d1b2f","category":"Tech"}
