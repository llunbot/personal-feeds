It measures 5.6 inches high, and 4.6 inches both wide and deep (13.9-x-11.7-x-11.7cm), which is smaller even than the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch charger juts out of the left side of the charging station as you face it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not tiltable like the HiRise 3 Deluxe, the MagSafe iPhone charging pad can hold the device in either landscape or portrait—so works well in StandBy mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with a 36W power adapter and a long 6.6ft (2m) power cable.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-charging-station-magsafe-white-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station white\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-charging-station-magsafe-white-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-charging-station-magsafe-white-1.jpg?resize=300%2C282&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-charging-station-magsafe-white-1.jpg?resize=768%2C723&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"963\" /></figure><p>OtterBox</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charging all three devices at the fastest possible speeds means the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station offers faster charging than most competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its closest competitors are the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2135180-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HR1Z2ZM/A/twelve-south-hirise-3-deluxe-3-in-1-wireless-charging-stand\" target=\"_blank\">Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe</a> and the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.belkin.com/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-magsafe-15w/P-WIZ009.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2135180-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin Boost Up Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charger Stand with MagSafe</a>, both of which are similarly priced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really must have a white charger, the OtterBox is smaller than the Belkin and will charge a Watch faster; the HiRise 3, which matches it on charging speed, comes in black only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can cope with the black-only color, the HiRise 3 Deluxe wins with its tiltable MagSafe iPhone charging pad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fy1811%3Fref%3Dsearch_Cube%26variant%3D42206465327254%26discount%3DWSCPGZ3PPU&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2135180-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube</a> is smaller still and can fast-charge an iPhone but is not as fast as the OtterBox at charging a Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have reviewed more products in our roundups of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MagSafe chargers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668468/best-apple-watch-chargers-stands-docks.html\" target=\"_blank\">best Apple Watch chargers</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-Charging-Station-top.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-Charging-Station-top.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-Charging-Station-top.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-Charging-Station-top.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OtterBox-3-in-1-Charging-Station-top.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station costs $149.99 direct from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/magsafe-3-in-1-charging-station-with-magsafe-white/78-80870.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2135180-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">OtterBox</a>.
