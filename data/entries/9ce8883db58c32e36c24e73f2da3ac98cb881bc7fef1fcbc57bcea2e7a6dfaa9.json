Like the \"Action\" button on the Apple Watch Ultra, users would be able to assign the new button to system functions like Ring/Silent, Do Not Disturb, or Flashlight.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMechanical buttons move when pressed, while solid-state buttons would rely on Taptic Engines inside the iPhone to simulate the feeling of movement. Apple analyst Jeff Pu believes solid-state buttons have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons/\">postponed until the iPhone 16 Pro next year</a> due to unspecified \"design issues\" encountered during iPhone 15 Pro development.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has included a Ring/Silent switch on every iPhone since the original model in 2007, so the switch's removal would still be a fairly significant change this year. The standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models are still expected to have the switch, however, as the \"Action\" button is rumored for iPhone 15 Pro models only.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new CADs also reveal that the rear camera bump on iPhone 15 Pro models will not protrude quite as much as the publication initially expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 15 lineup in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/iphone-15-pro-action-button-cads/\">iPhone 15 Pro Still Expected to Feature 'Action' Button Instead of Mute Switch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-still-expected-to-feature-action-button-instead-of-mute-switch.2387891/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ce8883db58c32e36c24e73f2da3ac98cb881bc7fef1fcbc57bcea2e7a6dfaa9","category":"Apple"}
