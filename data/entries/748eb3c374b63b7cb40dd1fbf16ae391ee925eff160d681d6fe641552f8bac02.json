The other option is that Apple is working on a new version of the ‌Apple Pencil‌ with a USB-C connector.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could in theory refresh the original ‌Apple Pencil‌ to replace the Lightning connector with a USB-C connector without too much hassle, allowing the company to carry on offering the higher-end, slimmer magnetic ‌Apple Pencil‌ that works with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and other iPads, and the lower-cost, rounder ‌Apple Pencil‌ that charges via a connector and works with Apple's low-cost ‌iPad‌ lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA USB-C port might not make sense if Apple has plans for a third-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ compatible with all iPads, as the new version would likely take after the second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ and charge magnetically via an ‌iPad‌. A single ‌Apple Pencil‌ that has no connector at all and is able to work with all iPads would simplify the ‌Apple Pencil‌ lineup and cut down on any confusion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is transitioning its products to USB-C because of new European Union regulations that require electronics to use a universal port. Apple could opt for a USB-C charging option for fast charging purposes, but a future ‌Apple Pencil‌ would also be able to skirt the USB-C requirement with wireless charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhether or not a new ‌Apple Pencil‌ has USB-C, there seems to be a third-generation version in the works. Earlier this week, a rumor suggested that the next ‌Apple Pencil‌ would feature magnetic tips with different shapes for drawing, sketching, and painting.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-apple-pencil-usb-c/\">iOS 17.1 Code References Apple Pencil With USB-C</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-code-references-apple-pencil-with-usb-c.2406180/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"748eb3c374b63b7cb40dd1fbf16ae391ee925eff160d681d6fe641552f8bac02","category":"Apple"}
