But Twitter’s self-reported data shows that, under Musk, the\ncompany has complied with hundreds more government orders for\ncensorship or surveillance — especially in countries such as\nTurkey and India.</p>\n\n<p>The data, drawn from Twitter’s reports to the Lumen database,\nshows that between October 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023, Twitter\nreceived a total of 971 requests from governments and courts.\nThese requests included orders to remove controversial posts, as\nwell as demands that Twitter produce private data to identify\nanonymous accounts. Twitter reported that it fully complied in 808\nof those requests, and partially complied in 154 other cases. (For\nnine requests, it did not report any specific response.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Free speech!</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/26/twitter-turns-in-its-transparency-homework-late-and-incomplete/\">Mike Masnick at TechDirt</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This isn’t a transparency report. It’s an obfuscation report. And,\nif Elon is correct that “transparency is the key to trust,” this\nreport suggests you shouldn’t trust Twitter one bit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/28/twitter-rest-of-world\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0d20188cb65370ca28c6ef7603228cc57400cfce4c961be38cbffd4091552d20","category":"Tech"}
