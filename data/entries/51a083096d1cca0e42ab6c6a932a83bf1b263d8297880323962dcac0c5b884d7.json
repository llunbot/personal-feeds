The show's fictional studio executive, Matt Remick, encounters Sarandos in a bathroom at the Golden Globes, where Remick expresses confusion over the frequency with which Sarandos is thanked by winners during their acceptance speeches. Sarandos replies that the gratitude is not spontaneous, but required by contract.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRogen told <em>Business Insider</em> that Apple executives asked if the role could instead be filled by Apple CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ instead. \"They asked if we could use ‌Tim Cook‌ instead, and we said no,\" he said. Sarandos's appearance on a rival platform is notable given the unusual nature of such cross-company collaboration at the executive level. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple TV‌+ has already ordered a second season of \"The Studio\" ahead of the series finale, which will be released on May 21. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/08/apple-wanted-tim-cook-to-appear-on-the-studio/\">Apple Wanted Tim Cook to Appear as Himself in Comedy Show 'The Studio'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wanted-tim-cook-to-appear-as-himself-in-comedy-show-the-studio.2456717/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51a083096d1cca0e42ab6c6a932a83bf1b263d8297880323962dcac0c5b884d7","category":"Apple"}
