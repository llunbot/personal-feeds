The reason? An order from US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who alleged that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-orders-halt-construction-new-york-offshore-wind-project-2025-04-16/\">the project was rushed through review</a>.</p>\n<p>The move comes as the US's nascent offshore wind industry is facing uncertainty, with all future leases <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/\">placed on hold</a> by an executive order issued on the day of Trump's inauguration. The hold was ostensibly put in place to allow time to review the permitting process. But Burgum's move comes the same week a report from the Government Accountability Office, done in response to the executive order, found only minor issues with the existing permitting process.</p>\n<h2>On hold</h2>\n<p>The Equnior project, termed <a href=\"https://www.empirewind.com/ew-1/\">Empire Wind</a>, is a key part of New York's plans to meet its climate goals. Combined with a second phase that's currently in planning, Empire Wind would have a rated capacity of two gigawatts, or over 20 percent of the state's planned offshore wind capacity. The initial construction, combined with the development of shore facilities, already has an estimated value of $2.5 billion, Equinor estimates, and is currently employing roughly 1,500 people. Construction was expected to be complete in 2027, although energy production from a subset of the 54 planned 15 MW turbines could have begun before then.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/us-interior-secretary-orders-offshore-wind-project-shut-down/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/us-interior-secretary-orders-offshore-wind-project-shut-down/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9486aac76b0c63edd0b399b3a10adee817f5f49d4eec8d2f128bc681f1c2ab3f","category":"Tech"}
