It’s a word that gets used a lot when describing the grouping of people around a common hub or ideology. Perhaps it’s a shared activity, like bikes, or a supportive network, like grassroots racing. Sometimes, “community” describes the bond found between common interests. We hear it and say it a lot. Just today, I counted how many times I interacted – hearing, reading, saying – with the word. Twenty-three times.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-113.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-113.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-113.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-113.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-121.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-121.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-121.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-121.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This social cohesion has intrigued me, or rather, how we speak about it has perplexed me. Like modern vernacular, words get absorbed into the zeitgeist and the definition becomes hard to distill. Then, there’s the subjective nature of interpretation. What one views as community, another might view it through a different lens.</p>\n<p>Even the common thesaurus doesn’t offer much clarity, as synonyms often carry social stigmas of their own. “Fraternity,” “clique,” or “clan” feel unwelcoming or exclusive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-95.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-95.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-95.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-95.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-87.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-87.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-87.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-87.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-68.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-68.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-68.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-68.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjclYneSuVY\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Yang’s fixed gear</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LlMxiz7BPw\" target=\"_blank\">Justin’s single speed Moots YBB</a> and Jim from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/outer.shell/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Outer Shell</a>‘s <a href=\"https://huntercycles.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hunter Cycles</a></em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-62.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-62.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-62.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-62.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Matt from <a href=\"https://passandstowracks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pass and Stow Racks</a> and his commuter…</em></p>\n<p><strong>“I know it when I see it.”</strong></p>\n<p>And I have witnessed it a lot, particularly in big cities like San Francisco.</p>\n<p>In cities and dense urban fabric, communities are bound and woven together, often culturally. This is how we end up with Japantowns, Koreatowns, and Chinatowns. The Mission District used to be a haven for punk and grassroots art movements, and while it has gotten slightly more commercial feeling, it still maintains its vibrant collage aesthetic.</p>\n<p>Talking with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nicholasmha/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick</a> after the event, he <span>mentioned that the city reminded him of the Japanese fiber art technique <em>boro</em>, where the patchwork repairs of an article of clothing transform the object into a new kind of beauty — beauty through usage — similar</span> to <em>wabi-sabi</em>, or accepting something for its imperfection.</p>\n<p>That’s how SF feels — like a comfortable old pair of jeans with so many repairs that they’re more patch than pants. While the Mission and other artist-flocked neighborhoods have shifted over the past twenty years, they still retain a lot of the grit and color that they’ve always had. There is beauty in the usage of these spaces.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-41.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-41.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-41.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-41.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-55.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-55.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-55.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-55.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Frequencies of common interests, coupled with creative endeavors, objects made by hands, colors laid down by brush, threads woven through fabric forming stronger patchwork — all these movements attract commonalities, and through these synergies, people congregate. More than anything in this world, humans want to find commonality and comradeship. We want to feel welcomed and part of something, all adding a different patchwork to this quilt.</p>\n<p>Bikes are a great thread that connects these fabrics of interests.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-30.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-30.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-29.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-29.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In the compound that houses the Outer Shell, Tunitas, McNally, and Sklar offices and studios, countless other artists share this space beneath a highway overpass.

This patchwork feels stronger than before.</p>\n<p><em>Boro.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-58.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-58.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-58.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-58.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-57.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-57.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-57.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-57.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>At the open house, I counted around one hundred folks rolling in throughout the afternoon. The bikes outside ran the gamut, with Hunter Cycles taking the award for highest frequency, and baskets abound. Is this a community? I’d say so, in the purest, most concentrated sense of the word. You didn’t have to buy into this space. No one cares what you wear or what bike you ride in these spaces. In fact, the more patchwork your bike, the better.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-94.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-94.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-94.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-94.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-61.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-61.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-61.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Outer-Shell-Tunitas-McNally-Sklar-Open-House-61.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Opening the door to your studio is all about finding synergies, meeting internet friends, petting dogs, and being inspired by the work these artists produce and the environments they create and inhabit. This open house was the perfect way to end my stay in the Bay.</p>\n<p>Thank you, San Francisco, this was a lovely trip and a much-needed break from the day-to-day grind.
