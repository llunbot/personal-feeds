{"title":"Meta Won’t Bring Future Multimodal AI Models to EU","link":"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/17/meta-future-multimodal-ai-models-eu","date":1721418207000,"content":"\n<p>Ina Fried, reporting for Axios:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months,\nbut not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European\nregulatory environment,” Meta said in a statement to Axios.</p>\n\n<p>Apple similarly said last month that it won’t release its\nApple Intelligence features in Europe because of regulatory\nconcerns. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Meta plans to incorporate the new multimodal models, which are\nable to reason across video, audio, images and text, in a wide\nrange of products, including smartphones and its Meta Ray-Ban\nsmart glasses. Meta says its decision also means that European\ncompanies will not be able to use the multimodal models even\nthough they are being released under an open license. It could\nalso prevent companies outside of the EU from offering products\nand services in Europe that make use of the new multimodal models.</p>\n\n<p>The company is also planning to release a larger, text-only\nversion of its Llama 3 model soon. That will be made available for\ncustomers and companies in the EU, Meta said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another big win for Thierry Breton and Margrethe Vestager. I’m sure EU tech companies will do just fine sitting out the AI boom, and EU customers will be happy to wait for years before getting features available to the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/19/meta-eu-multimodal-ai-models\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"569c7055b907963a2eef29fbb25be222f4b0dfa617169f2b742e7ff520263bbc","category":"Tech"}
