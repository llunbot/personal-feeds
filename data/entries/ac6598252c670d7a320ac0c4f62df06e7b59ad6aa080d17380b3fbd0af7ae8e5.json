After landing a full-time seat in IndyCar, he was named rookie of the year at the Indy 500 in June, finally showing the world his talent in a single-seat race car. F1's loss was IndyCar's gain, and the prospect of championships seemed certain. But <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/23411/here-are-the-injuries-indycar-star-robert-wickens-suffered-during-vicious-pocono-crash\">a bad wreck</a> derailed all of that, leaving Wickens paralyzed from the waist down. This past weekend, he made his return to the cockpit of a single-seater, testing a Formula E car with hand controls at Portland International Raceway.</p>\n<p>It wasn't his first time in a racing car since 2018—for the last few years he's been running in IMSA's Michelin Pilot Challenge series, taking the 2023 TCR championship in a Hyundai Elantra N. But Formula E's GenBeta car weighs almost 900 lbs less than Wickens' Hyundai and boasts far more power and that immediate electric torque. More power than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/porsche-unveils-smaller-lighter-faster-formula-e-race-car-the-99x/\">the Gen3 Formula E cars</a> that lined up to race the following day, too—the 530 hp (395 kW) GenBeta machine is Formula E's test bed and is able to deploy energy from its front electric motor (in addition to the rear motor) instead of just regenerating energy under braking.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Wickens a few hours before his test and asked what he was expecting in terms of performance. \"It's an entirely different beast to an IndyCar,\" he said. \"So I know here in Portland that they actually had the exact same straight line speed as IndyCar [170 mph/275 km/h], obviously achieving in very different ways. The aerodynamic differences between the two and the whole philosophy of the series are entirely different. You'll never really compare them, apples to apples, I don't think, but, I'm really excited to give the Gen beta car a go,\" Wickens said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035123#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035123&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
