The bags are available with a WaveLock closure for drop bars or a traditional roll-and-buckle for flat bars. With plenty of mounts for accessories and pockets for everything, it’s an entire front storage system! Check out all the details below.</em></span><em> </em><span></span></p>\n<p>The launch of the new Tailfin Bar Bag System finally completes the set, and we can now offer a full Tailfin setup for your bikepacking adventures; as with all Tailfin products, we have taken our time to create the most stable and user-friendly bar-mounted storage system out there. With four options to choose from, specifically designed for either drop or flat handlebars, we have been at pains to create the perfect solution for carrying extra gear on your bars in a design that will enhance your ride experience.</p>\n<p>The two-piece system has been chosen to provide incredible stability, adjustable positioning, and rapid attachment, the key performance features that make our approach the best.</p>\n<p>Four volumes provide options for all riders. Whether you are keeping it light and fast on a weekend road tour or planning a multi-month wilderness expedition, there is an option for you. The good news for riders who may be interested in multiple options is that the system is modular, allowing you to swap out different bag sizes to match your current requirements without needing to purchase a whole new system.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle24.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle24.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle24.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Social4.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Social4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Social4.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Social4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Social4.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Bar System Highlights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Available in drop and flat (MTB) handlebar versions, each with features and sizes specific to its style.</li>\n<li>Two volume/size options for each version:\n<ul>\n<li>Small Drop Bar – 4 → 9.1L &amp; 160mm Diameter</li>\n<li>Large Drop Bar – 6.7 → 12.5L &amp; 180mm Diameter</li>\n<li>Small Flat Bar – 5.8 → 14.7L &amp; 160mm Diameter</li>\n<li>Large Flat Bar – 8.7 → 18.9L &amp; 180mm Diameter</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Drop Bar bags feature unique patented WaveLock closure to maximise capacity and eliminate closure guesswork when fatigued.

The materials are strategically used to maximise their individual properties; durable Hypalon is used where wear can occur, and the lighter, more flexible Ripstop Nylon is used for the main body.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle2.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle2.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle1.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The new bar system is the first Tailfin product range to incorporate external expandable storage. Finalising the perfect mesh material was one of the most complex parts of the project. The chosen material features the optimum combination of stretch and durability to provide years of consistent performance. Each bag incorporates multiple front-facing pockets, including a zipped security pocket and an expandable cavernous front pocket – an ideal place for storing and drying wet jackets (something removable pockets can’t offer). We also incorporated a TPU strap to allow for adjustment of the volume and additional peace of mind when carrying extra gear. At the rear of each bag, you will also find a kangaroo-style pocket that can provide the perfect place to stow food, rubbish, or tent poles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle20.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle20.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle20.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle16.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle16.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle16.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>One of the key performance features of the bag design is its internal aluminium cage. This provides the mounting points for the X-Clamp attachment mechanism and also adds a level of stability not normally associated with this style of pack. The internal structure and X-Clamp are user-replaceable, and a full range of replacement parts, including bag skins, will be available.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HANDLEBAR-WIDTHS-03.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HANDLEBAR-WIDTHS-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HANDLEBAR-WIDTHS-03.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HANDLEBAR-WIDTHS-03.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HANDLEBAR-WIDTHS-03.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Drop Bar</h3>\n<p>The drop bar version features the most radical design of the range, incorporating our unique new WaveLock closure system. Designed to eliminate guesswork, make bag symmetry easy, and maximise capacity, all whilst being friendly on the hands when in the hoods and drops, WaveLock is a little stroke of Tailfin genius. Simply roll the bag as per a standard dry bag (two complete folds make it waterproof) and then clip the metal bars into the corresponding wave shape for a solid and secure lock. To keep things symmetrical on the other side, simply repeat and utilise the same positioned wave shape. Positioning of the WaveLock has been deliberately chosen to eliminate any hard edges that could catch on shifters and hands.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle22.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle22.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle22.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle22.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle25.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle25.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle25.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Two volumes are available: 9.1 litres and 12.5 litres, measuring 160mm and 180mm in diameter, respectively. Keeping with the Tailfin philosophy of providing an almost universal fit, the smaller volume bag can effectively fit a narrower 36/38cm handlebar width. Further volume is added through the multiple external pockets found on all sizes. The external pockets are sized to allow full entry even when the bag is in its smallest volume setting. When full, the pockets add an additional 1.6 and 2.75 litres of storage.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HEAD-ON-BAR-BAG-SHOT-FLAT.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HEAD-ON-BAR-BAG-SHOT-FLAT.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HEAD-ON-BAR-BAG-SHOT-FLAT.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HEAD-ON-BAR-BAG-SHOT-FLAT.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/HEAD-ON-BAR-BAG-SHOT-FLAT.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Flat Bar</h3>\n<p>Flat/MTB handlebars are less restricted regarding the available usable space, so we opted to create two larger capacity versions to maximise this advantage. Our bags are wider than most due to the extra stability of the system. Since tyre buzz can be such a huge problem, it’s better to have a smaller diameter but wider for additional storage. Available in 14.7 and 18.9-litre volumes with diameters of 150 and 180mm, the flat bar versions can swallow the bulkiest sleep kit. We opted to keep it simple with the double clip closure mechanism, providing a completely waterproof storage solution without limiting available space.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/WATERPROOF.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/WATERPROOF.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/WATERPROOF.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/WATERPROOF.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/WATERPROOF.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Large-capacity external pockets provide a huge amount of additional storage and enable quick access to your kit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle13.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle13.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle13.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle12.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle12.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle12.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle11.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Lifestyle11.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Optional Accessories</h3>\n<p>A complete range of optional accessory mounts is available to enable interference-free fitting of typical handlebar-mounted accessories such as lights and GPS devices.
