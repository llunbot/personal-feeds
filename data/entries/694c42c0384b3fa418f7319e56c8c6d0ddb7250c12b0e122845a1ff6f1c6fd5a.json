And today it’s an even better value: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75ZRQLB/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 15-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage for $1,099</a>, a savings of $200 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air has Apple’s refreshed design that looks a lot like a MacBook Pro. It’s all built around an amazing 15.2-inch Liquid Retina display and is only slightly thicker than the 13-inch model. And has the same features, including a speedy M2 processor, 18 hours of battery life, MagSafe for fast charging, two Thunderbolt ports, a fantastic keyboard, and a 1080p webcam. And of course, it’ll be ready for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma</a> when it arrives this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we loved the 15-inch MacBook Air’s display and performance and loved its “big, bright display” and “awesome battery life.” And today you can add “insanely great price” to that list as well.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"694c42c0384b3fa418f7319e56c8c6d0ddb7250c12b0e122845a1ff6f1c6fd5a","category":"Apple"}
