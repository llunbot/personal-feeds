{"title":"Amazon Elasticsearch Service Is Now Amazon OpenSearch Service and Supports OpenSearch 1.0","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elasticsearch-service-is-now-amazon-opensearch-service-and-supports-opensearch-10/","date":1631138081000,"content":"<p>In 2015, we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-elasticsearch-service/\">launched</a> Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES), a fully managed service that makes it easy for you to perform interactive log analytics, real-time application monitoring, website search, and more.</p> \n<p>Amazon ES has been a popular service for log analytics because of its ability to ingest high volumes of log data. Additionally, with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/general-availability-of-ultrawarm-for-amazon-elasticsearch-service/\">UltraWarm</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-cold-storage-for-amazon-elasticsearch-service/\">cold storage tiers</a>, you can lower costs to one-tenth of traditional hot storage on Amazon ES. Because Amazon ES integrates with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ko/elasticsearch-service/the-elk-stack/logstash\">Logstash</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/\">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html\">Amazon CloudWatch Logs</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iot\">AWS IoT</a>, you can select the secure data ingestion tool that meets your use case requirements.</p> \n<p>Developers embrace open-source software for many reasons. One of the most important reasons is the freedom to use that software where and how they want. On January 21, 2021, Elastic NV announced that they would change their software licensing strategy. After Elasticsearch version 7.10.2 and Kibana 7.10.2, they will not release new versions of Elasticsearch and Kibana under the permissive 2.0 version of the Apache License (ALv2). Instead, Elastic NV is releasing Elasticsearch and Kibana under the Elastic license, with source code available under the Elastic License or Server Side Public License (SSPL). These licenses are not open source and do not offer users the same freedom.</p> \n<p>For this reason, we decided to create and maintain <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/\">OpenSearch</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/\">a community-driven, open-source fork</a> from the last ALv2 version of Elasticsearch and Kibana. We are making a long-term investment in the <a href=\"http://opensearch.org/\">OpenSearch project</a> and recently <a href=\"https://www.opensearch.org/blog/updates/2021/07/opensearch-general-availability-announcement/\">released version 1.0</a>.</p> \n<p>OpenSearch provides a highly scalable system for providing fast access and response to large volumes of data with an integrated visualization tool, <a href=\"https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards\">OpenSearch Dashboards</a>, that makes it easy for users to explore their data. OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards were originally derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2 and Kibana 7.10.2. Like Elasticsearch and <a href=\"https://solr.apache.org/\">Apache Solr</a>, OpenSearch is powered by the <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/\">Apache Lucene</a> search library.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Announcing Amazon OpenSearch Service </u></strong><br /> Today, we rename Amazon Elasticsearch Service to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/\">Amazon OpenSearch Service</a> because the service now supports OpenSearch 1.0. Although the name has changed, we will continue to deliver the same experiences without any negative impact to ongoing operations, development methodology, or business use.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/04/2021-opensearch-service-1.png\" /></p> \n<p>Amazon OpenSearch Service offers a choice of open-source engines to deploy and run, including the currently available 19 versions of ALv2 Elasticsearch <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-elasticsearch-service-announces-support-for-elasticsearch-version-7-10/\">7.10 and earlier</a> and OpenSearch 1.0. We will continue to support and maintain the ALv2 Elasticsearch versions with security and bug fixes. We will deliver all-new features and functionality through OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards. Amazon OpenSearch Service APIs will be backward-compatible with the existing service APIs, so there is no need for you to update your current client code or applications. We will keep <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/keeping-clients-of-opensearch-and-elasticsearch-compatible-with-open-source/\">clients of OpenSearch compatible</a> with open source.</p> \n<p>To get started, in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/\">AWS Management Console</a>, choose <strong>Create a domain</strong>. In <strong>Step 1: Choose deployment type</strong>, select <strong>OpenSearch 1.0 (latest)</strong>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/04/2021-opensearch-service-2.png\" /></p> \n<p>We recommend OpenSearch 1.0 if you are deploying a new cluster and want access to the latest features and enhancements. OpenSearch 1.0 is compatible with the open-source Elasticsearch 7.10 APIs and most clients.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Upgrading to OpenSearch 1.0</u></strong><br /> Amazon OpenSearch Service offers a seamless in-place upgrade path from existing Elasticsearch 6.x and 7.x managed clusters to OpenSearch. To upgrade a domain to OpenSearch 1.0 in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/es/\">AWS Management Console</a>, choose the domain that you want to upgrade, choose <strong>Actions</strong>, and then select <strong>Upgrade domain</strong>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/04/2021-opensearch-service-4.png\" /></p> \n<p>Next, you can select a version to upgrade to <strong>OpenSearch 1.0</strong> for your existing domain without creating a separate domain and migrating your data.</p> \n<p>The upgrade process is irreversible. It can’t be paused or canceled. During an upgrade, you can’t make configuration changes to the domain. Before you start an upgrade, you can perform the pre-upgrade checks for issues that can block an upgrade and take a snapshot of the cluster by selecting <strong>Check upgrade eligibility</strong>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/04/2021-opensearch-service-3.png\" /></p> \n<p>Amazon OpenSearch Services starts the upgrade, which can take from 15 minutes to several hours to complete.
