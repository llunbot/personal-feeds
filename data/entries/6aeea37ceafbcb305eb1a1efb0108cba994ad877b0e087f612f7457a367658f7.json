The company also said that by accessing those \naccounts, hackers were also able to access “a significant number \nof files containing profile information about other users’ \nancestry.” But 23andMe would not say how many “other users” were \nimpacted by the breach that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/23andme-resets-user-passwords-after-genetic-data-posted-online/\">the company initially disclosed in \nearly October</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, there were a lot of “other users” who were \nvictims of this data breach: 6.9 million affected individuals \nin total. </p>\n\n<p>In an email sent to TechCrunch late on Saturday, 23andMe \nspokesperson Katie Watson confirmed that hackers accessed the \npersonal information of about 5.5 million people who opted-in to \n23andMe’s DNA Relatives feature, which allows customers to \nautomatically share some of their data with others. The stolen \ndata included the person’s name, birth year, relationship labels, \nthe percentage of DNA shared with relatives, ancestry reports and \nself-reported location. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s a real shocker: <a href=\"https://stackdiary.com/23andme-updates-tos-to-force-binding-arbitration/\">23andMe has updated their terms of service in attempt to prevent a class action lawsuit</a>. Good luck with that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/06/23andme-hack\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6aeea37ceafbcb305eb1a1efb0108cba994ad877b0e087f612f7457a367658f7","category":"Tech"}
