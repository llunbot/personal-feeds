{"title":"Like Apple, Meta is Working on Humanoid Robots","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/meta-humanoid-robots-development/","date":1739575371000,"content":"Facebook parent company Meta is investing heavily in AI-powered humanoid robots, according to a report from <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/meta-plans-major-investment-into-ai-powered-humanoid-robots\">Bloomberg</a></em>. Meta wants to create robots that can act like humans and help people with physical tasks, and has developed a new team in its Reality Labs hardware to work on the project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-Robot-Emoji-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nMeta's first focus will be on robots that can do household chores, but the company's overarching goal is to develop AI, sensors, and software for robots that can be manufactured and sold to third-party companies to allow those companies to develop their own robots. Meta is aiming to be the Android of robots.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRobot technology is not currently advanced enough to allow robots to fold clothes, do dishes, or complete other household chores, but Meta feels that its work in artificial intelligence and virtual reality could boost robot development.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2025, Meta will spend around $65 billion on artificial intelligence infrastructure, robotics, and virtual reality products. Meta plans to build some of its own hardware, and work with robotics manufacturers to build prototypes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf Meta does end up creating a humanoid robot, it could compete with an Apple-designed robot in the future. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/kuo-apple-robots-likely-2028-or-later/\">is working on</a> both humanoid and non-humanoid robots, but the company's work on humanoid robotics is in the proof-of-concept stage and years away from launching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNon-humanoid robots could come sooner. Apple is said to be working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/\">a tabletop robot</a> with an iPad-style display that's attached to a robotic arm, and such a product could come as early as 2026 or 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple robotics researchers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-prototypes-tabletop-robot/\">recently shared details</a> on a lamp-like robot prototype with lifelike movements and human-like interaction capabilities.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/meta-humanoid-robots-development/\">Like Apple, Meta is Working on Humanoid Robots</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/like-apple-meta-is-working-on-humanoid-robots.2449398/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"99a249fc3055da361df4be36a1158e75199ee798467042a96cc015d25e951365","category":"Apple"}
