But now that Niftski has pushed that time even lower—setting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khu9BB2g4Ks\">a new world record of 4:54.631 for a live, human-controlled full game run</a>—we're left grasping for metaphors that accurately capture the performance.</p>\n<p>Niftski's new record perfectly matches a \"perfect\" TAS of the game (i.e., a \"tool-assisted speedrun\" that uses frame-by-frame input recordings using an emulator) through seven of the run's eight levels. His best time is now running ahead of the \"theory limit\" of 4:54.798 that runner Bismuth set <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CgC2g43smA&amp;t=1750s\">back in 2018</a> as the ideal human performance standard.</p>\n<p>In the battle of man versus machine, Niftski is now just 0.35 seconds away from standing up, John Henry-style, against the standard of machine-made automation. Hey, I guess I did come up with a good metaphor after all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966742#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966742&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"82c4e88f041c5db4110593898681e30887f4e8b60d049134e0632525ed959023","category":"Tech"}
