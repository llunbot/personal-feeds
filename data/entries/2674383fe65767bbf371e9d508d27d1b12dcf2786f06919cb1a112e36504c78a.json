Apple updates the iPhone every year, but it doesn’t always change the design—sometimes the significant changes are on the inside, such as faster new components. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various reasons why you might be wondering what iPhone I have. Not everyone walks into an Apple shop to buy the latest model. You might have been handed down an iPhone by a family member who was unclear about which model it is, in which case you might be wondering if it would be a good idea to update the iOS on it. This can be an issue because only certain models can run <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675711/ios-15-latest-version-problems-new-features-for-iphone.html\">the latest version of iOS</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re struggling to identify one of your other Apple devices, we also have guides to finding <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671220/which-ipad-model-have-i-got.html\">which iPad you have</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671943/what-mac-do-i-have.html\">which Mac you have</a>. Read on to find out how to tell which iPhone you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Check your iPhone Name in Settings </h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The simplest way to tell which iPhone you have is to open up the Settings app. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>At the top of the list, you’ll see <em>Model Name</em>, which tells you exactly which iPhone model you have.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tip: You can also scroll down to check the capacity of your iPhone, which is something you will want to share if you are thinking of selling it.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iphone-name.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"How to find iPhone Name\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iphone-name.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1169w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iphone-name.jpg?resize=300%2C275&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iphone-name.jpg?resize=768%2C704&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"939\" /><figcaption>As long as you can get into Settings it’s easy to see what iPhone you have. </figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check the Model number</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below <em>Model Name, </em>you will also see <em>Model Number</em> in Settings. This can tell you a little more than the name of the device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually even more useful because the number that is displayed by default is actually the part number (it probably begins with an M, though if you have a replacement phone it may start with an N). If you pop that part number into a search engine it will tell you exactly which model you have including capacity and color. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a huge number of possible M numbers, far more than we can list here. Check <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models#iPhone&amp;xcust=1-1-671941-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">the iPhone Wiki</a> for a full list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find the Part Number</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to find that iPhone part number in Settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Below <em>Model Name</em> you will see <em>Model Number</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Model Number</em> to see the Part Number (it will begin with an A).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iPhone-A-number-.png\" alt=\"How to find the A number on iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iPhone-A-number-.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1170w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iPhone-A-number-.png?resize=300%2C276&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iPhone-A-number-.png?resize=768%2C708&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"943\" /><figcaption>The A number is hidden – you have to tap on the Model Number section. </figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to identify an iPhone if you couldn’t turn it on used to be to check the part number that was etched onto the back. But Apple hasn’t printed part numbers on the back since the iPhone 7. If you have a recent model, or find the number too small to read, there are other ways to identify the iPhone A number, which we will discuss below.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model number can give you useful information like the country it was sold in, which may be important for warranty reasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you have an older iPhone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an older iPhone (iPhone 7 and earlier) you will see a small identification number printed on the back. When we say “small number,” we really do mean small, and you may find it hard to read the number with the naked eye. A magnifying glass will help if you’ve got one!</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 3GS model number\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-3gs-model-number.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>Apple used to print the model number on the back of iPhones.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you have a SIM tray</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another way to find the A number if you can’t turn your iPhone on and it’s not on the back, but you may need a magnifying glass!

(Note, Apple stopped putting SIM trays in iPhones with the iPhone 14.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Find-A-number-in-Sim-Slot.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"The  iPhone A number is hidden in the SIM slot\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Find-A-number-in-Sim-Slot.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1169w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Find-A-number-in-Sim-Slot.jpeg?resize=300%2C170&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Find-A-number-in-Sim-Slot.jpeg?resize=768%2C436&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Find-A-number-in-Sim-Slot.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" /><figcaption>If you have a poky thing for opening the SIM card slot you can find the A number. </figcaption></figure><p> </p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Look for design differences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you simply can’t turn the iPhone on to check Settings for the information above, don’t worry.
