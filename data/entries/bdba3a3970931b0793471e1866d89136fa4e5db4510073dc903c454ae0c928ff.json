So this year, we're once again running a special Twelve Days of Christmas series of posts, highlighting one science story that fell through the cracks in 2020, each day from December 25 through January 5. Today: the surprisingly complex physics of two simply constructed instruments: the Indonesian bundengan and the Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo (or didjeridu). </em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The bundengan is a rare, endangered instrument from Indonesia that can imitate the sound of metallic gongs and cow-hide drums (kendangs) in a traditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan\">gamelan</a> ensemble. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo\">didgeridoo</a> is an iconic instrument associated with Australian Aboriginal culture that produces a single, low-pitched droning note that can be continuously sustained by skilled players. Both instruments are a topic of scientific interest because their relatively simple construction produces some surprisingly complicated physics. Two recent studies into their acoustical properties were featured at <a href=\"https://acoustics23sydney.org/\">an early December meeting</a> of the Acoustical Society of America, held in Sydney, Australia, in conjunction with the Australian Acoustical Society.</p>\n<p>The bundengan originated with <a href=\"https://www.auralarchipelago.com/auralarchipelago/bundengan\">Indonesian duck hunters</a> as protection from rain and other adverse conditions while in the field, doubling as a musical instrument to pass the time. It's a half-dome structure woven out of bamboo splits to form a lattice grid, crisscrossed at the top to form the dome. That dome is then coated with layers of bamboo sheaths held in place with sugar palm fibers. Musicians typically sit cross-legged inside the dome-shaped resonator and pluck the strings and bars to play. The strings produce metallic sounds while the plates inside generate percussive drum-like sounds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990299#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990299&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bdba3a3970931b0793471e1866d89136fa4e5db4510073dc903c454ae0c928ff","category":"Tech"}
