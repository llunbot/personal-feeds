Yes, that’s real hand-laid gold leaf. They aren’t exceptionally modern with an 18mm internal width and flat sides. But at least they are tubeless, disc brake with thru-axles, fitted with CeramicSpeed bearings, and truly light…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lightweight Meilenstein EVO S.E.

But spotting them again made me ask myself, “how much do these things really cost?” Lightweight has always been the <em>de facto</em> ultra-expensive, ultra-premium, ultralight carbon wheelset in my mind. But as I see more and more wildly expensive bikes and fancy wheels, are they really that much more expensive? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of this summer’s Paris 2024 games, Lightweight is using these limited edition gold-encrusted wheels to remind us of reigning Olympic road champion Richard Carapaz’s Tokyo 2020 win on Lightweight wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a tribute set of Meilenstein EVO Signature Gold Edition wheels seemed like an appropriate refresher on how exclusive these are. And to rethink how relevant Lightweight wheels might be?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair.jpg\" alt=\"Lightweight Meilenstein EVO Signature Edition Gold carbon road wheels, angled pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_angled-pair-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These Signature Edition Gold carbon road wheels start out as a standard set of Lightweight Meilenstein EVO road wheels. That means they are centerlock disc brake wheels with a 48mm deep hooked tubeless rim that is just 18.2mm wide internal, and full-carbon permanently-bonded spokes. With completely flat sides at 24mm wide outside, they’re probably not exceptionally aero with any modern-width road tires. But at least they are quite light at a claimed 1380g for the pair. Not ultralight, but Lightweight do apparently approve them for some gravel riding, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Lightweight Meilenstein EVO Signature Edition Gold carbon road wheels, gold logos\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lightweight-Meilenstein-EVO-Signature-Edition-Gold-carbon-road-wheels_23k-gold-leaf-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes these limited edition Meilenstein EVOs so special are the hand-laid 23-carat (95.8% pure) gold leaf logo graphics created for Lightweight by Rie:Sel Design.

Officially, Lightweight won’t tell us how much they cost, because “prices are set by the dealers”. But that’s what these are likely to set you back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweight only made 99 pairs of the Gold-edition wheels. And they’ve split them up with 33 sets for Europe, 33 sets for Asia/Pacific, and the final 33 sets for the Americas. First come, first served.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snap a pair up if you have almost ten grand burning a hole in your pocket. And if you need the most ostentatious way to show off your disposable income on a not-quite-up-to-date set of uber fancy carbon hoops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://lightweight.info\" target=\"_blank\">Lightweight.info</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/how-much-could-23k-gold-leaf-lightweight-meilenstein-evo-carbon-wheels-really-cost/\">How Much Could 23k Gold-Leaf Lightweight Meilenstein EVO Carbon Wheels Really Cost?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"11e9b9793b1a385452e368fcb0c81818ddf891aea0df19879db96ad315107a05","category":"Cycling"}
