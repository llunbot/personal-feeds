What if that same tiny pump also included storage for a tire plugger? Sounds good, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does to us, which is why we were excited to check out the latest EnCase pump from Wolf Tooth Components. Called the 30cc in reference to its size, the newest addition joins the existing 40cc and 85cc EnCase pumps to round out the lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smaller and lighter than CO2?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components EnCase 30cc pump actual size weight review -2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-2-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components EnCase 30cc pump actual size weight review -2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-1-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WTC calls the 30cc one of the smallest pumps in the world, and that doesn’t seem like a stretch. It’s certainly the smallest pump we’ve tried that also includes internal storage. Without retooling their internal tire plugger storage, the 30cc pump is about as short as WTC could make it and still offer room for storage. Comparing it to a 25g CO2 cartridge with a micro-inflator, the 30CC pump is actually a bit shorter – it’s only when you screw the inflator down on the cartridge to activate it that they would be similar length. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components EnCase 30cc pump actual size weight review -2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-5-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components EnCase 30cc pump actual size weight review -2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-3-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components EnCase 30cc pump actual size weight review -2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth-Components-EnCase-30cc-pump-actual-size-weight-review-4-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 30cc pump is also lighter (as long as the tire plugger is removed). For comparison purposes I’m using a 25g cartridge because it’s what I would carry for large volume tires and a very light-Lezyne inflator head. The CO2 combo checks in at 109g, while the pump alone weighs just 82g. Once you add the tire plugger, it’s still close – 113g for the pump and plugger combo. Once you consider that the pump is reusable and that weight includes the ability to plug the hole, it seems like a no-brainer. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inflation Speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth EnCase 30cc pump in use\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_4-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photo/WTC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, CO2 still has the advantage when it comes to inflation speed. With that said, the 30cc pump is surprisingly quick for its size. I tested it on a completely-flat 29 x 2.4″ tubeless tire on a 30mm rim and it took two minutes to get to 18psi. Importantly, it didn’t require much effort at all, just easy but constant pumping. Even more important, the push-on/pull-off pump head won’t ever unthread your valve stem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the other EnCase pumps, the 30cc includes smart features like their Enviro-Lock that prevents the pump internals from getting dirty when it’s not in use. It also has a simple press fit cap for the pump head to keep it clean there too. If you’re not using the internal storage there is a plug for the bottom as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do manage to damage any of the pieces, the pump is covered by the WTC Right to Repair principle which ensures that spare parts will be available down the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the difference between the 30cc and 40cc pumps?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth EnCase 30cc pump storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_5-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth EnCase 30cc pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_7-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth EnCase 30cc pump size comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_3.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photos/WTC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the 30cc and the 40cc pumps are both priced at $64.95, what’s the difference between the two? The main difference is the size, which gives the 40cc pump 10cc of air volume more per stroke, which should make it slightly faster to inflate your tire. That size difference is also crucial because it’s just enough to allow the 40cc pump to store either the WTC chain tool/tire plugger or hex bit multi-tool or the tire plugger. The smaller 30cc pump can <em>only</em> fit the tire plugger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the absolute smallest pump possible, go for the 30cc version. If you want a slightly larger pump with the option to carry a multi-tool or chain tool, then the 40cc is still your best bet. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WTC 30cc EnCase Pump Pricing &amp; Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_5.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_5-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth EnCase 30cc pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_5-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_5-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_5-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_5-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_5.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_2-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth EnCase 30cc pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_2-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_2-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_2-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_2-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_30cc_Studio_2.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Base pump with mount, left. Shown with optional tire plugger, right. (Photos/WTC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, the 30cc EnCase pump starts at $64.95 which is the same as the 40cc version. Note that this is the price for just the pump itself, and the price will increase as you add options like the tire plugger. The base price does include a multi-position mount which allows easy positioning on bikes regardless of the diameter downtubes or seat tubes. The inner mount position is designed to work with the Wolf Tooth B-RAD Bottle Shift for even tighter positioning. Wolf Tooth Claims that with the pump mounted next to a bottle cage and a tire plug pre-loaded on the Tubeless Tire Plugger inside the pump, a puncture can be plugged and reinflation can begin within seconds. That means less time on the side of the trail and more time riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 30, 40, and 85cc EnCase pumps are available now from WTC directly, or any stocking dealer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/tools?gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACraZvvTALJfno4NYNDS_VcXvK75b&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-ty8BhA_EiwAkyoa3zUMeJapgK-ipooK5IqpQ291J3MRL87j5y0po9B_GggeISIiOP5tsBoCWw4QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">wolftoothcomponents.com<br /></a></em><br /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtc-encase-30cc-smallest-pump-internal-strorage-tire-plugger/\">New WTC EnCase 30cc is the Smallest Pump with Internal Storage We’ve Seen</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1b3831223224536aaeca43c9feec3319bc56d6fff005c3fb1b134af5b28645a4","category":"Cycling"}
