Apple is apparently planning to roll out adjustments to comply with the new legal requirements in the coming weeks, including splitting off the ‌App Store‌ in the EU from the rest of the world. The deadline for Apple to comply with the DMA is March 7, so the company has just over seven weeks to enact the changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> met the European Union's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a>. Vestager <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/12/tim-cook-meets-eu-antitrust-chief/\">reminded Cook</a> of Apple's impending obligation to allow users to install third-party app stores and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/\">sideload apps</a> under the DMA.
