The investigations, which were conducted in conjunction with nonprofit groups Citizen Lab, Forbidden Stories, Amnesty International, and other human rights groups, found that military grade spyware was used to hack dozens of phones belonging to “journalists, human rights activists, business executives and two women close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it was extremely unlikely that the spyware had infected more iPhones that the small number that were targeted, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/351546/pegasus-spyware-ios-14-7-1-iphone-amnesty-mobile-verification-toolkit-nso-group.html\">Apple patched the vulnerability in iOS 14.7.1</a>.
