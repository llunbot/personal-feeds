The Apple Store app is also down at the current time. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe'll update this article when the online Apple Store is back up and functional, and we'll let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know if there are any notable changes. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update:</b> The online Apple Store is back up. Apple has re-added a \"Store\" tab to its main site, but that appears to be the only change, suggesting the outage was mostly a behind-the-scenes maintenance update. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-store-new-website-section.jpg\" /><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-online-store-temporarily-down/\">Apple's Online Store Temporarily Down [Update: Back Up]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-online-store-temporarily-down-update-back-up.2306426/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LdNGdLJwSVg:lTVPRZH7nFA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LdNGdLJwSVg:lTVPRZH7nFA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LdNGdLJwSVg\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"071ca953818ee88bdd54d4f5c1909bb3565ea21a225591e35c9477b44a1a04ac","category":"Apple"}
