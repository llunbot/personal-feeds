{"title":"Puzzmo Is Getting a Native iOS App Monday","link":"https://www.theverge.com/games/668478/puzzmo-is-finally-getting-an-app","date":1747440766000,"content":"\n<p>Scheduled to drop Monday, but you can click-through to <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puzzmo-solve-smile-share/id6714482734\">pre-download it now</a>. If you’re not familiar, Puzzmo is sort of a collection of “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage\">newspaper puzzle games for the online age</a>”. (Which is also a good description for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/lex-games\">recent DF sponsor</a> <a href=\"https://lex.games/df\">Lex.Games</a>.) One of Puzzmo’s cofounders is <a href=\"http://stfj.net/\">Zach Gage</a>, whose hits include <a href=\"http://www.reallybadchess.com/\">Really Bad Chess</a> and <a href=\"https://playknotwords.com/\">Knotwords</a>, and who was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/05/09/ep-346\">my guest on The Talk Show back in 2022</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, if casual puzzle games are your jam, you should check out Puzzmo. My suggestion is check them out now, see how you like it as a web app on your iPhone, and then compare when the app hits the App Store on Monday. Puzzmo is a really good web app. I bet, though, the app is better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/02/06/digging-into-perf/\">This blog post from Puzzmo developer Orta Therox</a> from February, discussing some of the engineering changes they made while developing the app. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/16/puzzmo-native-app\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8f3db6804a381e1c23ab4a2d4384af29146ae4995cd30653463315ad39fa1fa3","category":"Tech"}
