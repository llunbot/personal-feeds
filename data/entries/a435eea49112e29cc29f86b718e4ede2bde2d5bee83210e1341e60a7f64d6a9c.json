A force restart can be initiated by simultaneously holding down the side button and the Digital Crown for 10 seconds. AASPs have also been asked to make sure affected Apple Watches are running the latest version of watchOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first began looking into the touch-related problem affecting some Apple Watch models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/10/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-touch-screen-issue/\">in February</a>. At the time, it was a bug that had been seen on the Series 9 and the Ultra 2. Apple Watch owners were experiencing \"false\" or \"ghost\" touches on the display, which could cause the screen to \"jump erratically\" or exhibit unexpected behavior without user interaction.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA fix for the ghost touch issue was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-watchos-10-4/\">added in watchOS 10.4</a>, so presumably that version of the software addresses the issue on all impacted models. If not, the wording of Apple's memo suggests a further fix will be coming in the near future.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/apple-watch-ghost-touch-issue-series-7/\">Apple Suggests Solution for 'Ghost Touch' Issue on Apple Watch Series 7 and Later</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-suggests-solution-for-ghost-touch-issue-on-apple-watch-series-7-and-later.2423963/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a435eea49112e29cc29f86b718e4ede2bde2d5bee83210e1341e60a7f64d6a9c","category":"Apple"}
