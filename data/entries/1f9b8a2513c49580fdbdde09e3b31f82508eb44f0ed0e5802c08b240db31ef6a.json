I also almost crashed, but the team did a very good job, keeping me in the front. We were aware that we would have needed to pull the peloton from the beginning, it was all on us to make the race demanding in the end and it was as planned.”</p>\n<p>Mattias Skjelmose (Trek-Segafredo) and Mikel Landa (Bahrain Victorious) rounded out the podium, with Michael Woods (Israel Premier Tech) coming through fourth.</p>\n<p>High speeds and blustering winds kept the favorites group together over the final lap, and the remnants of an early break were swept up for 1,000-meter uphill sprint.</p>\n<p>Pogačar and his UAE Team Emirates teammates hovered at the front all day, but never budged until the Mur.</p>\n<p>Magnus Sheffield, celebrating his 21st birthday, led the bunch onto the lower steep ramps. Woods and Pogačar were well-positioned, and Woods was still at the front with 400m to go when Romain Bardet (Team DSM) almost ran into his rear wheel.</p>\n<p>Pogačar looked almost blocked until he exploded with under 200m to go. No one could answer, and he blazed across the line victorious to back up his win at Amstel Gold Race on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) said he paid for the efforts Sunday at Amstel Gold Race, when he dug deep to finish third behind the winning Pogačar, and could only must 18th.</p>\n<p>“I think this is where [Pogačar] is beatable on this climb, but today it was not me,” Pidcock said. “I was not good today. I just didn’t have any explosivity. I went really deep on Sunday and I haven’t recovered. I think I can win this race on my day, but I didn’t have the strength when it really mattered.”</p>\n<p>Pogačar’s victory sets up a possible Ardennes treble on Sunday and a showdown against defending champion Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step) at Liège-Bastogne-Liège.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=10&amp;y=2023\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p>\n<h2>Following the script early</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.velonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1483286861.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption><span>The group was still together after two of three climbs up the Mur de Huy.</span> (Photo: Luc Claessen/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If anyone was expecting a long-distance bomb from Pogačar, they tuned in too early.</p>\n<p>The first two of three passages over the Mur played out to script. Taking a page from the traditional playbook, an early move peeled away, with an eight-rider group forging clear. The gap was about 1 minute to the favorites over the first passage up the Mur de Huy.</p>\n<p>Georg Zimmermann (Intermarché-Circus-Wanty) and Søren Kragh Andersen (Alpecin Deceuninck) were the last two standing, nursing a lead of about 50 seconds going into the bell lap.
