{"title":"Daring Fireball Weekly Sponsorships for Q4","link":"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/","date":1633885045000,"content":"\n<p>Speaking of DF weekly sponsorships, there are still a few openings in the October-December quarter. <em>Plus</em>, this coming week’s spot, starting Monday, remains open.</p>\n\n<p>One sponsor per week, with a sponsor-written entry in the RSS feed to start the week, a thank-you post right on the homepage from me at the end, and the one and only graphic ad on every page of the site all week long. No tracking or other privacy-invasive bullshit. Just plain honest ads. That’s not new — that’s the way the ads on DF have <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2004/09/sponsor_this\">always been</a>.

So if you’ve got a product or service you’d like to promote to DF’s discerning audience, <a href=\"mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship\">I’d love to have you as a sponsor</a>. And if you’re ready to grab next week’s opening, let’s go.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/10/df-sponsorships-q4-redux\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c626a3ac45d73414441f2ff01053fd4f327a435167500ff884ee9d7bdd3ebd47","category":"Tech"}
