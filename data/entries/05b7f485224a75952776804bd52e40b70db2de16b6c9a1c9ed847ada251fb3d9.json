{"title":"Alba Optics: Delta Ultra Sunglasses","link":"https://theradavist.com/2021/07/alba-optics-delta-ultra-sunglasses/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=alba-optics-delta-ultra-sunglasses","date":1627568466000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/DELTA_ULT_GO_VZUM_ML_ALU-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://albaoptics.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Alba Optics</a>, an eyewear company based in Italy, began when its founders looked for an original mold for sports shades from the 80s. Once they found it, they began producing sunglasses in Italy, starting with the Delta. A little while later, they took the Delta and refined it, offering wider, 360º panoramic views. This new lens is called the U-Lens and it offers a more streamlined silhouette. The frames are made from a material called Tr90, a hybrid material fabricated from nylon and carbon fiber, organically compatible and safe to the skin, even after prolonged use. It is 20% lighter than other conventional materials and it offers more protection against crashes.</p>\n<p>So what are the Delta Ultra sunglasses for? Gravel? Road? MTB? Whatever you want. The Delta Ultra sunglasses come with a carrying pouch, retention straps, and retail for €179,00 with free shipping to the USA.
