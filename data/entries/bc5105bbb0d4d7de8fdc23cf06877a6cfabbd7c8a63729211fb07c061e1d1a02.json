Apple received the first-ever <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-over-counter-hearing-aid-software\">FDA authorization for hearing aid software</a> on September 12. There has been some evidence that the latest iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 include the code for this feature, but it is not yet activated in the beta. It is quite possible that Apple will enable it with a server-side switch when it is ready, and these frequent AirPods Pro 2 firmware updates may be the result of rigorous internal testing of the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>AirPods Pro 2 USB-C</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1218\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 USB-C\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1218w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=244%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 244w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C946&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=974%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 974w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" alt=\"Editors' Choice\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2022-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$249\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/used/1787391/BI/0000/KBID/0000/BI/21318/KBID/22251/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$182.95 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6447382&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6447382%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831\" target=\"_blank\">$189.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJV3AM/A/airpods-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$249 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Updating your AirPods firmware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There isn’t a way to force an upgrade to the new firmware; it will automatically install when the AirPods are in their case and charging. It can take hours or even days to get the latest firmware. If you haven’t used your AirPods in a long time, taking them out of their case and using them for a few minutes before putting them back in and on the charger may help speed things up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see what firmware version your AirPods are running, you can open the Settings app, select your connected AirPods (near the top), scroll down past all the options to the <em>About</em> section, and look at the <em>Version</em> line. You can also find this information in <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em> &gt; <em>[name of your AirPods]</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"bc5105bbb0d4d7de8fdc23cf06877a6cfabbd7c8a63729211fb07c061e1d1a02","category":"Apple"}
