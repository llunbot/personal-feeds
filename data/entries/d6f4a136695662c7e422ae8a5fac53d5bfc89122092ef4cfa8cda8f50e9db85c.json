For the AirPods and ‌AirPods Pro‌, Apple will update the design of the earbuds and the case, while also improving audio quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the AirPods are refreshed, Apple will phase out the second-generation and third-generation models, offering two fourth-generation models at different price points instead.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth of the fourth-generation AirPods models will look like a cross between the current AirPods and the ‌AirPods Pro‌, with Apple introducing shorter stems. The higher-end version of the standard AirPods will feature Active Noise Cancellation, a feature that has thus far been limited to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ and the ‌AirPods Max‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFit will be \"improved,\" but it is unclear if Apple plans to add silicone ear tips. As for the case, it will gain speakers for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> alerts, similar to the current ‌AirPods Pro‌, and a USB-C charging port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods Max‌ will see the inclusion of a USB-C port for charging purposes instead of a Lightning port, and Apple will also debut new colors. No other notable features are expected at this time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2025, the ‌AirPods Pro‌ will be updated with a new design and a faster chip, plus the earbuds could get some previously-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/12/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features/\">hearing health features</a>. Rumors have suggested Apple is working on functionality that would let the ‌AirPods Pro‌ collect hearing data and better serve as a hearing aid replacement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no clear word yet on when in 2024 and 2025 we might see AirPod refreshes, but Apple typically introduces new models in the latter half of the year around when new iPhones come out. Gurman says that the AirPods will come out \"later next year\" and the ‌AirPods Max‌ will come out \"around the end of next year.\"<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/\">New AirPods and AirPods Max Launching in 2024, Updated AirPods Pro Coming in 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airpods-and-airpods-max-launching-in-2024-updated-airpods-pro-coming-in-2025.2408657/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d6f4a136695662c7e422ae8a5fac53d5bfc89122092ef4cfa8cda8f50e9db85c","category":"Apple"}
