That suggests the feature will be released as part of an iOS 19.4 update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his newsletter, he revealed that additional features have been \"postponed\" until iOS 19.4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"I'm told that a larger-than-usual number of features scheduled for iOS 19 (beyond the new Siri) are already postponed until spring 2026 (when iOS 19.4 debuts),\" he wrote.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe did not provide any details about those other planned features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the meantime, iOS 18.2 adds <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/ios-18-2-hands-on/\">ChatGPT integration to Siri</a>, and Gurman expects an integration with Google's Gemini to follow in a later update. Apple previously confirmed that iOS 18.2 will be released to the public in December. And <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/22/apple-intelligence-features-timing/\">with iOS 18.4</a>, Siri will gain on-screen awareness, deeper per-app controls, and a few other enhancements, but it will still not offer fully-fledged ChatGPT-like conversational abilities directly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce the new Siri is released, iPhone users should not have to tap into third-party services like ChatGPT and Gemini as often. iOS 19.4 is still around a year and a half away from being released, though, so a long wait remains.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/ios-19-rumors/\">iOS 19 Rumors: More ChatGPT-Like Siri, Some New Features 'Postponed'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-rumors-more-chatgpt-like-siri-some-new-features-postponed.2443865/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee5d349a4fc78147cc25faa4103a773ce1b350e4ab62f86212249206c4af4fc1","category":"Apple"}
