The more a virtual character looks like a human, the more our brains squarely focus on the CGI inaccuracies.</p>\n<p>I kept thinking about this concept after seeing <em>Free Guy</em>, a new film from the combined Disney-Fox borg that takes gaming authenticity very seriously. But I didn't feel that way because the movie, starring Ryan Reynolds (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/deadpool-movie-suffers-for-and-hilariously-mocks-its-major-licensing-issues/\"><em>Deadpool</em></a>) and Taika Waititi (<em>What We Do In The Shadows</em>), resembles the CGI tragedy of 1999's <em>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</em>.</p>\n<p>Rather, <em>Free Guy</em>'s insistence on gaming-universe authenticity, which it takes damned seriously, means it approaches a conceptual uncanny valley. How much that'll annoy you is arguably the biggest question mark attached to an otherwise solid, fun, and family-friendly action flick.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786924#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786924&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aa3f44a3edb480db1e8ae9093e8697ff67c691b980ece6701a60a3f47ec2e6e5","category":"Tech"}
