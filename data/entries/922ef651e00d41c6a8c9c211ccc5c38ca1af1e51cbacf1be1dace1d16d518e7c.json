This precluded Delta from having any other customers than the US government. I didn't love the low flight rate, just 16 missions in 20 years. This prevented the rocket's operator, United Launch Alliance, from ever approaching anything remotely like efficient operations.</p>\n<p>But there were two things I adored about the Delta IV Heavy rocket, which made its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/after-a-fiery-finale-the-delta-rocket-family-now-belongs-to-history/\">final launch on Tuesday</a>. I loved watching it take flight. And I love that, warts and all, it demonstrated that private companies could develop a heavy lift rocket. The Delta booster, although the product of decades of traditional space development, offered a glimpse of the commercial launch future that we're living in today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015968#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015968&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"922ef651e00d41c6a8c9c211ccc5c38ca1af1e51cbacf1be1dace1d16d518e7c","category":"Tech"}
