Four of Steam's top five GPUs are 60-series cards, and the only one that isn't is an even lower-end GTX 1650.</p>\n<p>All of this is to say that, despite all the fanfare for high-end products like the RTX 4090, the new GeForce RTX 4060 is Nvidia's most important Ada Lovelace-based GPU. History suggests that it will become a baseline for game developers to aim for and the go-to recommendation for most entry-level-to-mainstream PC gaming builds.</p>\n<p>The RTX 4060, which launches this week starting at $299, is mostly up to the task. It's faster and considerably more power efficient than the 3060 it replaces, and it doesn't come with the same generation-over-generation price hike as the higher-end Lovelace GPUs. It's also a solid value compared to the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cj28R4MTR6w\" target=\"_blank\">4060 Ti</a>, typically delivering between 80 and 90 percent of the 4060 Ti's performance for 75 percent of the money.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950229#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950229&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a2eb7ffcf61d9689940cd57becdae0c164b751ae23def8ab49fa9667bd546761","category":"Tech"}
