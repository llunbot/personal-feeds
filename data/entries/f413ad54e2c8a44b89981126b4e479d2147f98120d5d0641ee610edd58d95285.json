The Pinarello Dogma F12, gifted to the Pope by Ineos Grenadiers’ Egan Bernal in 2021, is on auction until Sunday 24th March 2024 via the online marketplace <a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/en/l/78951653\" target=\"_blank\">Catawiki</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinarello’s colour scheme is a baby blue and white dedicated to the Pope’s native Argentina and is estimated to go for between €20,000-€30,000. When the Colombian gifted the bike in 2021, he did so as a then-24-year-old Giro d’Italia champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope-970x728.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope-970x728.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope-1140x855.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Pinarello-Dogma-F12-Pope.jpeg 1600w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernal is a Roman Catholic and described the meeting as ‘the most beautiful’ experience of his life, eclipsing his two Grand Tour victories. In addition to the 2021 Giro d’Italia title, the Ineos Grenadiers rider also won the Tour de France in 2019 and became the first Latin American rider to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello is synonymous with success in cycling and the brand has sponsored Ineos Grenadiers since their inception as Team Sky in 2010. So far, 12 Grand Tour titles have been won by the team on Pinarello bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catawiki has previously been used to sell bikes such as <a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/en/l/68100821-banesto-tour-de-france-1994-miguel-indurain-1994-bicycle\" target=\"_blank\">Miguel Indurain’s 1994 Tour de France Pinarello</a>, <a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/nl/l/64280903-team-jumbo-visma-tour-de-france-2022-jonas-vingegaard-cervelo-r5\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard’s Cervélo R5</a> and Thibaut Pinot’s <a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/en/l/77168217\" target=\"_blank\">Lapierre Symbiosis</a> bike from the 2023 Tour de France prior to his retirement, which became the most favourited Tour de France-related object on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinarello Dogma F12 is on auction until Sunday 24th March on <a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/en/l/78951653\" target=\"_blank\">Catawiki</a>. At the time of writing, the highest current bid is just €2,200.
