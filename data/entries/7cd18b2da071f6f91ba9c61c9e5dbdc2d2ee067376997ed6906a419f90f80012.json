He also reiterated that \"we need to make products in the United States.\" Trump is expected to announce some kind of semiconductor tariff in the coming days.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump has suggested that Apple could manufacture the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and other products <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/trump-apple-us-iphone-manufacturing/\">in the United States</a>, but even if such a move were not wildly expensive, Apple would not be able to find enough people with the necessary skillset to assemble devices in the quantities needed.
