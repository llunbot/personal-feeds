A small robotic capsule was on the way back to Earth with rocks scooped from an asteroid, and Lauretta was eager to get his hands on the samples.</p>\n<p>Led by Lauretta, scientists carefully designed the billion-dollar mission to bring home pieces of a carbon-rich asteroid thought to contain organic molecules, the building blocks necessary for life to take hold. This NASA mission, known by the acronym OSIRIS-REx, launched from Earth in 2016, collected samples from a roughly 1,600-foot-wide (500-meter) asteroid named Bennu in 2020, then set a course for return to Earth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/nasa-spacecraft-returns-to-earth-with-pieces-of-an-asteroid/\">On September 24</a>, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft released the canister containing the asteroid samples to plunge into the Earth's atmosphere, while the mothership steered onto a course to take it safely back into deep space for a follow-up mission to explore a different asteroid at the end of the 2020s.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989304#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989304&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e12c99403fee81903c471239a93582f0903a309f6960701fa38b8007bbd6a812","category":"Tech"}
