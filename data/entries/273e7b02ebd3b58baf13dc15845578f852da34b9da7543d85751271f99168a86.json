Avalanches and sand dunes exhibit similar dynamics. But scientists at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania have discovered that applying a magnetic torque can actually cause sand-like particles to collectively flow uphill in seeming defiance of gravity, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41327-1\">September paper</a> published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>\n<p>Sand is pretty fascinating stuff from a physics standpoint. It's an example of a granular material, since it acts both like a liquid and a solid. Dry sand collected in a bucket pours like a fluid, yet it can support the weight of a rock placed on top of it, like a solid, even though the rock is technically denser than the sand. So sand defies all those tidy equations describing various phases of matter, and the transition from flowing \"liquid\" to a rigid \"solid\" happens quite rapidly. It's as if the grains act as individuals in the fluid form, but are capable of suddenly banding together when solidarity is needed, achieving a weird kind of \"strength in numbers\" effect.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980391#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980391&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"273e7b02ebd3b58baf13dc15845578f852da34b9da7543d85751271f99168a86","category":"Tech"}
