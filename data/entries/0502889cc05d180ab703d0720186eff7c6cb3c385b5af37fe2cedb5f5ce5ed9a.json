The sheer number of options—keyboard size, the type and the manufacturer of the switches, the style and material of the keycaps, among others—can make it hard to know where to start. And yet, once you <em>do </em>start using a mechanical keyboard, there’s a lot to love, from the excellent key travel and typing feel to the satisfying clackity-clack of the switches to the customizability of the keycaps.</p>\n\n<p>As we talked about in our review of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/razer-pro-type-ultra-review-a-fresh-and-pricey-wireless-mechanical-keyboard/\" target=\"_blank\">Razer Pro Type Ultra</a>, good wireless mechanical keyboards are still hard to come by. That’s doubly true if you’re looking for one from a more established company that can provide US-based technical and warranty support and well-maintained, actually useful software. Which is why I’m glad to see Logitech expanding its mechanical keyboard offerings with the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/pop-keys-wireless-mechanical.920-010708.html\" target=\"_blank\">$100 Pop Keys Bluetooth keyboard</a>.</p>\n<p>The Pop Keys is definitely not for everyone. Its high-contrast, high-saturation color palette, rounded typewriter-style keycaps, and dedicated emoji keys will instantly turn off people who just want a keyboard-looking keyboard. Its keycap quality leaves a bit to be desired, too. But as a starter mechanical keyboard, or as a mechanical alternative for other Logitech Bluetooth keyboards like the budget-minded K380 or the MX Keys Mini, it’s an aesthetically striking option with reliable connectivity and a decent feel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812102#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812102&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0502889cc05d180ab703d0720186eff7c6cb3c385b5af37fe2cedb5f5ce5ed9a","category":"Tech"}
