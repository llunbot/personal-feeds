But at Visma-Lease a </span><span>Bike’s</span><span> 2025 team presentation, there was a noticeable confidence and conviction that their quiet, understated Danish superstar is hungry to get his own back. </span><em><span>I’m</span><span> coming for you, Tade</span></em><span>j, was the message.</span></p>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<p><span>“I</span><span> think my crash had a big impact on my season last year,</span><span>” </span><span>Vingegaard said, referencing his horror fall at </span><span>April’s</span><span> Itzulia Basque Country,</span><span> “</span><span>and I still made it back [for the Tour] to be there in a super high level after only six weeks of preparation.</span><span>” </span><span>He lost the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france?srsltid=AfmBOopxk-fhMGGn9Y7PESeO5DhC19BDgvIBa98TxkbXr3osxzkyRzaK\">Tour de France</a> to Pogačar by six minutes but won a stage and was comfortably the </span><span>Slovenian’s</span><span> strongest challenger.</span><span> “</span><span>Because of the crash, so many things happened, and it </span><span>gives me motivation</span><span> to try again,</span><span>” </span><span>he said.</span><span> “</span><span>My big goal is to go for the third win in the Tour de France, and I still believe I can fight for victory there</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Vingegaard, who turned 28 in December, was honest that he </span><span>wasn’t</span><span> capable of beating</span><span> Pogačar in 2024, </span><span>largely</span><span> because of injury.</span><span> But since then, </span><span>he’s</span><span> been on a mission to make sure that the Tour – the</span><span> “</span><span>holy grai</span><span>l”,</span><span> as he calls it – becomes his race once again.</span><span> “</span><span>I do believe I can do </span><span>a lot</span><span> better, especially in the preparation three months before,</span><span>” </span><span>he said. The rarefied air of the high mountains has typically been </span><span>Vingegaard’s</span><span> strong point despite hailing from one of </span><span>Europe’s</span><span> flattest countries. But at the Tour in 2024, </span><span>it was Pogačar who</span><span> excelled above 2,000m. Vingegaard </span><span>is focused</span><span> on turning that specific dial back in his favour.</span><span> “</span><span>I still believe I can beat him, yes, and it might be at altitude,</span><span>” </span><span>he said.</span><span> “</span><span>Of course, if you had asked me two years ago, </span><span>I’d</span><span> have said that was my strength and where he was a bit less strong, but last year </span><span>it</span><span> seemed like he was strong in all aspects. </span><span>I think we</span><span> have to believe my strength is where we can make the difference</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Jonas Vinegaard\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Vingegaard04_visma_camp_01_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736933022\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image by James Startt</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Pogačar, the man he will always </span><span>be compared</span><span> to, changed his coach and training after the 2023 season, but Vingegaard has resisted doing something similar. Evolution rather than revolution will bring him back to his best form.</span><span> “</span><span>Normally, I never do any gym work because I normally gain muscle quite quickly, but </span><span>to try</span><span> to regain what I lost last year, </span><span>I’ve</span><span> been doing a bit of gym sessions,</span><span>” </span><span>he said. </span><span> “</span><span>You have </span><span>to always keep</span><span> improving, see what you can do. </span><span>I </span><span>do think in the small details</span><span> you can make a step, but basically, I still do the same training.</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>Of what </span><span>he’s</span><span> done so far this winter, </span><span>he’s</span><span> bullish.</span><span> “</span><span>I do feel like I have improved compared to last year and </span><span>that I</span><span> can get even better,</span><span>” </span><span>he added.</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>We also still believe I can improve as a cyclist, but </span><span>it’s</span><span> more about focusing on yourself, getting better every day, and seeing </span><span>what the outcome will be</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The plan for Vingegaard is that </span><span>he’ll</span><span> begin his season at the Volta ao Algarve in February, before then racing Paris-Nice and Volta a Catalunya. Interspersed between two blocks of altitude training ahead of the Tour will be the Critérium du Dauphiné. </span><span>That stage race-heavy programme,</span><span> in the absence of any one-day races, is a method that Visma believes in steadfastly.</span><span> “</span><span>In my eyes, Jonas is the best GC rider in the world, and Tadej is the best rider in the world who can do everything,</span><span>” </span><span>Visma’s</span><span> lead sports director, Grischa Niermann, said.</span><span> “</span><span>For Jonas, </span><span>it’s</span><span> not </span><span>that easy</span><span> to show up at Liège and Lombardia and drop everybody. </span><span>We want to win races</span><span>, want to</span><span> use </span><span>everyone’s</span><span> qualities in the best way, and using </span><span>Jonas’s</span><span> qualities in the best way is making him do stage races</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard during the 2024 Tour de France\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20240710TDF0081-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters_f997523d-130e-48c7-b1bf-08545d513f1d_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736933420\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Image by ASO</span></em></p>\n<p><span>What Visma have discarded – for now – is Vingegaard copying </span><span>Pogačar’s</span><span> 2024 calendar and attempting the Giro-Tour double. Regaining yellow is just too important.</span><span> “</span><span>We were actually talking about going to the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia?srsltid=AfmBOopnr7bSOm11GdADYWfv7_thazttyuUSH0f6SRCjBFewzo6LBKb2\">Giro </a></span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia?srsltid=AfmBOopnr7bSOm11GdADYWfv7_thazttyuUSH0f6SRCjBFewzo6LBKb2\"><span>d'Italia</span></a><span>,</span><span>” </span><span>Vingegaard admitted.</span><span> “</span><span>But pretty soon, we realised that the main goal would always be the Tour de France. We were thinking about taking the Giro as a kind of preparation, but there are so many factors </span><span>when</span><span> you go to the Giro. How is the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/giro-ditalia-route?srsltid=AfmBOoqBmxGZ1RJsj6C8K8jP5Xrxk6e9TuFUKRsMSLzbCRqomVwVgtpQ\">Giro [route]</a>? How is the weather? How hard do you have to go every day? There are a lot of things you </span><span>can’t</span><span> control yourself. Then we realised that if you go on a training </span><span>camp</span><span> you can control every training [session] you do, and </span><span>that’s</span><span> probably better</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<p><span>So, a schedule </span><span>he’s</span><span> happy with, a training plan </span><span>he’s</span><span> got</span><span> dialled in, what about the seven support riders?</span><span> “</span><span>I believe </span><span>it’s</span><span> </span><span>a very strong</span><span> team,</span><span>” </span><span>he said. Sepp Kuss, Matteo Jorgenson, Christophe Laporte, new signings Simon Yates and Victor Campenaerts, and either Wilco Kelderman or Steven Kruijswijk will </span><span>be alongside</span><span> him.</span><span> “</span><span>It’s</span><span> maybe even stronger than </span><span>it ever has been</span><span> before,</span><span>” </span><span>Vingegaard added. Everything is in place for the battle to recommence this July. </span></p>\n<p><em><span>*Cover image by James Startt</span></em></p>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"3a71f62942f7b515b81757664c0b5e3b49847c2eaf721b7a856beed974ad4e0b","category":"Cycling"}
