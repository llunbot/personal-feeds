In a report <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-intelligence-service-wwdc/\">outlining his WWDC expectations</a>, Gurman said these iconsÂ will look more colorful on iOS 18, whereas they currently have very basic designs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore significantly, he said the Tapback system will work with any emoji starting on iOS 18, providing users with hundreds of new options to choose from. This means the Messages app would finally support in-line emoji reactions, a feature that other messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and Telegram have offered for a long time. Currently, the Messages app only allows emoji to be added to messages as stickers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if the revamped Tapback system will also work with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">AI-generated emoji</a> feature previously reported to be coming with iOS 18.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother much-requested feature coming to the Messages app with iOS 18 is the ability to schedule a message to be sent later, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will unveil iOS 18 and other major software updates for its platforms during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-june-10/\">WWDC keynote</a>, which will be live streamed via the Apple Events website, YouTube, Apple TV app, and Apple Developer app on June 10 starting at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. The new Messages features would extend to the iPad and Mac.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/\">Messages</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/ios-18-emoji-tapback-rumor/\">Rumor: iOS 18 Will Finally Let You React to iMessages With Any Emoji</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-ios-18-will-finally-let-you-react-to-imessages-with-any-emoji.2428373/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f99bd01eb26cbb200ffd534b13753bb2d6e363bf08f133b8d78fe0d3bcbbe43","category":"Apple"}
