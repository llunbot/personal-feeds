{"title":"F1 in Spain: Now that was a lapse in judgment","link":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/f1-in-spain-now-that-was-a-lapse-in-judgement/","date":1748874403000,"content":"<p>Formula 1 held its annual Spanish Grand Prix this past weekend at the Catalunya circuit near Barcelona. It's a good place to test a modern F1 car, as you need <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/how-a-day-driving-high-downforce-cars-at-vir-taught-me-im-ok-being-slow/\">great aerodynamics</a> to be fast around here, especially now that the awkward chicanes are gone. You also need good mechanical grip. Races used to be processional here, but the re-profiled turn 10 and the flat-out nature of the last turn have changed all that.</p>\n<p>This was to be the weekend of new front wings, the result of a \"technical directive\" meant to stop excessive flexing as part of the sport's ongoing antipathy toward creatively movable aerodynamics <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/lighter-nimbler-more-hybrid-power-he-f1-car-of-2026/\">outside a tightly described domain</a>. The competitive order would be reset, some hoped, as their rivals would be forced to give up unfair advantages. In fact, the new wings turned out to be a nothingburger. McLaren's advantage remains, and that was clear on a circuit that tests every aspect of a racing car.</p>\n<p>But there's only one story that anyone really cares about after Spain, and it's the one about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. For much of the race, Verstappen held onto third place, behind the too-fast McLarens. This required using one more set of tires than they did, and for his last stint, all that was left for the Red Bull driver was a set of the too-hard compound, giving him little in the way of grip.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/f1-in-spain-now-that-was-a-lapse-in-judgement/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/f1-in-spain-now-that-was-a-lapse-in-judgement/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
