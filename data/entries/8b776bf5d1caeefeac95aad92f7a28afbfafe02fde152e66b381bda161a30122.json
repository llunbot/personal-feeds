ANC means the ‌AirPods 4‌ have a feature set that rivals the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2, so we thought we'd compare the two for those undecided on which to get.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods 4‌ are Apple's first open-ear earbuds to include ANC, and the major difference between the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 and the ‌AirPods 4‌ is the silicone tips. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 have silicone tips for a tighter seal in the ear, while the ‌AirPods 4‌ don't.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou're not going to get the same level of ANC with the ‌AirPods 4‌ that you get with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 because there's no sealing mechanism to block out noise, but the ‌AirPods 4‌ still perform impressively well. The new earbuds are able to cut down on plane and road noise even without the tight ear seal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSound quality is about the same because the ‌AirPods 4‌ now have the same H2 chip as the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2. The ‌AirPods 4‌ have a much smaller case than the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2, but both cases have a speaker that can play a sound when you need to track them down using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a>. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> wireless charging is exclusive to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2, though. The ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC can wirelessly charge, but not with the strong magnetic connection available with the ‌AirPods Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a few other differences that are worth knowing about, which we go over in the video above.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChoosing between the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 and the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC mostly comes down to fit. For some people, the silicone tips for the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 are more comfortable, and others find an open-ear design to be better for long wear. Price is also a factor, as the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 4 with ANC are $179 and the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 are $249. Of course, if you don't need ANC at all, you can get the ‌AirPods 4‌ without ANC for $129.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLet us know which earbuds you prefer in the comments below.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/28/airpods-4-vs-airpods-pro-2/\">AirPods 4 With ANC vs. AirPods Pro 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-with-anc-vs-airpods-pro-2.2438460/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b776bf5d1caeefeac95aad92f7a28afbfafe02fde152e66b381bda161a30122","category":"Apple"}
