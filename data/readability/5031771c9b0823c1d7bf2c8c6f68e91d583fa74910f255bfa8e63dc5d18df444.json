{"title":"Gallery: André Greipel, gentle giant of the sprints","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/gallery-andre-greipel-gentle-giant-of-the-sprints/","date":1633398472000,"content":"<div><div><p>In the rain of Münster, one of the great sprinters of his generation pedalled toward the finish line, sat up, and applauded. André Greipel had just completed his final race, after a distinguished 19-year career.</p><p>The fairytale would have been for a win, but it didn’t turn out that way. The German finished 10th in his retirement ride. “It’s finished now”, Greipel reflected at the finish line, “but I did my maximum. There was nothing more in the legs today, so I’m happy now that this day has finished. Now I’ll try to continue thinking positively for the future, and see what happens.”</p><p>Greipel might be looking to the future, but he has a long string of highlights to look back on in his past. Across his long innings as a pro cyclist, Greipel has ridden 19 Grand Tours, picking up 22 stage wins – 11 at the Tour, seven at the Giro, four at the Vuelta. He retires with 158 wins to his credit, most of them in sprints.</p><p>His career has seen him rise as part of a crop of legendary sprinters – among them Marcel Kittel and Mark Cavendish – and decline as younger, hungrier and more versatile rivals have taken their place.</p><p>Greipel broke through to the pro ranks with T-Mobile, which morphed into HTC-Columbia. In his four years at this squad, he picked up his first Grand Tour stage wins and two Tour Down Under titles.</p><p>The friendly German then left for greener pastures at the team best known as Lotto-Soudal, where he rode from 2011-2018 and collected some of his most memorable victories – including back-to-back stage wins on the Champs Elysées.</p><p>A short, unsuccessful one year stint at Arkea-Samsic followed, before Greipel ended his career with a two year contract at Israel Start-Up Nation.</p><p>Over almost two decades as a pro, the big German was feared in the sprints but beloved by the public. Successful fast-men are often wired a particular way – brash, sometimes abrasive – and Greipel was neither.</p><p>Cycling loses a faded sprinter, but the peloton loses a friend.</p><hr><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00004341-009-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Once upon a time, in the mid-2000s, there was a German with a dream. His name was André, and at the 2005 Rheinland Pfaltz Rundfahrt, he stood on a podium as winner of the sprint classification, riding for the continental Wiesenhof team.<p>He was yet to take his first pro win, but that would change by the end of the year …</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00005868-032.jpg\"><figcaption>… along with his hair, which I am lost for words to describe.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00006751-003-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>“Hey André, how do you think that look will age?”</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00011648-087-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Having shed the weight of his diamond studs, Greipel got the call-up to his first Grand Tour – the 2008 Giro d’Italia – where he took his biggest win to date on stage 17, finishing one position ahead of his teammate, a young up-and-comer called Mark Cavendish.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00012328-002-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Our intrepid hero was on a path to greatness.

At his first Vuelta a España, Greipel won four stages – this being the first. Four Columbia-HTC riders finished in the top seven that day.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00014107-016-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>He backed it up in nicer conditions the next day, ahead of Belgium’s #1 Party Starter, Tom Boonen.<p>(Excuse the blurriness of the picture, we are deep in the archives at this point.)</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00015829-021-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>By 2010, Greipel and a supple-faced Tony Martin were teammates. Martin at this point was yet to commit to a pro career – he was still a part-time cop – but, if you were a criminal, would you be afraid of that dreamy smile, those pristine blue eyes? You would not.<p>(Like Greipel, Tony Martin has called the 2021 season his last.

As you are about to learn, that is a team that was not shy about getting The Boys into some ridiculous promo shots.<p>On which note, here’s Greipel on the bonnet of a Skoda Roomster, a car so unlovely that it was introduced and then discontinued from sale in Australia <em>twice</em>.</p><p>Does the front half look like it was designed by a different team than the back? Yes. Do I know so much about Skoda Roomsters because I’m currently looking at one in my driveway? I’ll never tell.</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00016600-061-1340x884.jpg\"><figcaption>André Greipel and Jurgen van den Broeck cup the elbows of Philippe Gilbert, because who the hell knows.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00016610-003.jpg\"><figcaption>And now André Greipel cups the calf of Gilbert in the boot of a Skoda Octavia, a much less idiosyncratic vehicle.<p>Jurgen van den Broeck keeps his hands to himself.
