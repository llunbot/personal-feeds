Both bikes share the same aero <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a>.</p>\n<p>The integrated bar-stem is carbon and mimics the aero design of the one found on the Filante SLR.

You can configure the system via the Mahle app.</p>\n<p>The battery that powers the hub motor is integrated in the down tube and has a 236Wh battery capacity. Wilier claims the battery life is around 100km with 1,000m of elevation.</p>\n<p>If that’s not enough, an additional 171Wh battery can be installed on the seat tube bottle cage.</p>\n<p>There’s also a new torque and frequency sensor at the bottom bracket, which communicates with the motor. Wilier says the way the assistance is delivered is more progressive because it’s based on the power you’re putting into the cranks.</p>\n<p>The X20 hub motor is claimed to weigh 3.3kg and has 24 holes to accept straight-pull spokes.</p>\n<p>Unlike other systems, the bike uses a conventional thru-axle. Wilier has achieved this by integrating a slider with a built-in electrical connector to ensure the hub positions itself directly in contact with the battery without the risk of misalignment.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wilier Filante Hybrid against a wall\" title=\"Wilier Filante Hybrid against a wall\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The charge port is integrated neatly into the junction of bottom bracket and down tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The charging point for the system is found at the junction of the down tube and seat tube.</p>\n<p>The Pulsar One 2.1in display sits in front of the integrated cockpit and connects via ANT+ to the X20 system.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The 'iWoc' lives on top of the bar-stem.\" title=\"Wilier Filante Hybrid against a wall\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ‘iWoc’ lives on top of the bar-stem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Mahle’s ‘iWoc’ button is located flush on top of the bar-stem, enabling you to turn the system on and off and monitor your remaining battery life.</p>\n<p>You can also change between the four pedal assistance modes – ‘Automatic’, ‘Eco’, ‘Sport’ and ‘Boost’.</p>\n<h2>A spec fitting for the price tag</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wilier Filante Hybrid against a wall\" title=\"Wilier Filante Hybrid against a wall\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s a full Dura-Ace R9200 groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Our test bike in this classy ‘Silver Glossy and Matt’ colourway comes equipped with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9200-review/\">Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200</a> groupset.
