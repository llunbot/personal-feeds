In response, he said Apple has increased the specifications of the tetraprism lens supplied by Largan Precision in order to compensate for this. As a result of this change, and to meet strong demand for the iPhone 15 Pro Max overall, Kuo said Largan Precision has expanded its production lines for the tetraprism lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 15 Pro Max shipping estimates range from 3-4 weeks for some configurations to 6-7 weeks for others. Yesterday, Kuo said iPhone 15 Pro Max demand had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/kuo-iphone-15-pro-max-robust-demand/\">outpaced iPhone 14 Pro Max demand</a> during the same period last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the camera-related bottleneck, Kuo previously said that the iPhone 15 Pro Max entered mass production later than the other devices in the iPhone 15 series, which has presumably contributed to the device's lengthy shipping delays. In the U.S., the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the iPhone 15 models are now available to order and launch this Friday.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/kuo-apple-improving-iphone-15-pro-max-production/\">Kuo: Apple Urgently Addressing iPhone 15 Pro Max Production Challenges to Boost Supply</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-urgently-addressing-iphone-15-pro-max-production-challenges-to-boost-supply.2403015/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"78ff77436c6ea4284705669477889e866e21408809ebd4a5f366d65703a025d4","category":"Apple"}
