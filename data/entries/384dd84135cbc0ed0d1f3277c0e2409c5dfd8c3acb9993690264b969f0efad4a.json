Barely a week goes by that another model doesn't arrive in the Gemini app or developer tools like AI Studio, and there's a major release coming to the app today. Google has announced that its faster, more efficient Gemini 2.5 Flash model is rolling out widely in preview. At the same time, developers can begin building with 2.5 Flash using the company's newly announced API pricing, which Google says is much lower than competing products.</p>\n<h2>A gaggle of Gemini</h2>\n<p>The model dropdown in the Gemini app is a bit convoluted, particularly as we see products like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/googles-veo-2-generative-video-creator-is-coming-to-gemini/\">Veo 2</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-gemini-ai-can-now-see-your-search-history/\">Personalization</a> popping up there. Google has been releasing so many preview models and new ways of using Gemini that it can be hard to know which option to choose for a given task. In fairness, Google is far from the only major AI player with this problem.</p>\n<p>Tulsee Doshi is Google's director of product management for Gemini, which means she leads the team building these models. We asked Doshi what version of Gemini she finds herself using, and unsurprisingly, she likes the more powerful option. \"Typically right now, I have been using 2.5 Pro,\" says Doshi. \"I use Gemini throughout the day for my work in a few key areas, like creating documents or slides. That's either for internal consumption or actually sharing externally, and I've found 2.5 Pro to be really helpful for the creative writing element.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/gemini-2-5-flash-comes-to-the-gemini-app-gives-developers-control-over-thinking/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/gemini-2-5-flash-comes-to-the-gemini-app-gives-developers-control-over-thinking/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"384dd84135cbc0ed0d1f3277c0e2409c5dfd8c3acb9993690264b969f0efad4a","category":"Tech"}
