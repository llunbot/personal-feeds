At the time, the analyst said Apple would likely release a large-screen foldable iPad or MacBook in that timeframe before launching a higher-volume foldable iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu had said one Apple foldable with a 20.3-inch display would start production in late 2025, which was sooner than previously expected. However, Pu's latest comments suggest the specific timeline for releasing the foldable iPad may have been delayed or pushed back from its originally anticipated launch date.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-foldable-ipad-delays/\">Report: Apple's First Foldable iPad Could Face Delays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apples-first-foldable-ipad-could-face-delays.2432754/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b693db5af21a113063cca9654ffb284fa3b629cd2ae2d18911f9b260612b98e4","category":"Apple"}
