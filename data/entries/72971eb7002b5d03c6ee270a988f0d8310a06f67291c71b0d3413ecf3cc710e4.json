But they come with one tweak that hasn't been reported on, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/\">per MacRumors</a>: They enable all of the AI-powered Apple Intelligence features by default during setup. When Apple Intelligence was initially released in iOS 18.1, the features were off by default, unless users chose to opt-in and enable them.</p>\n<p>Those who still wish to opt out of Apple Intelligence features will now have to do it after their devices are set up by navigating to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri section in the Settings app.</p>\n<p>Apple Intelligence will only be enabled by default for hardware that supports it. For the iPhone, that's just the iPhone 15 Pro series, iPhone 16 series, and iPhone 16 Pro series.
