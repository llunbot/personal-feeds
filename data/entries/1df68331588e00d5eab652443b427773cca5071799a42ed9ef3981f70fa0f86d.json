After being a prolific winner in the junior ranks, Georgi stormed to success early in her senior career too, winning the British National Championships in 2021 when she was just 20-years-old. As well as being an integral part of Team DSM's lead-out train for Lorena Wiebes last year and Charlotte Kool this season, Georgi has also excelled when given the opportunity to go for a result herself. She proved that earlier this year when she took her first Women's WorldTour win with a brave solo attack at Brugge-De Panne. At the start of this season, she spoke to <em>Rouleur</em> about her love for the cobbles, the wobbly start to her cycling career and much more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\"><strong><em>This article was originally published in Rouleur Issue 118.

Although it wasn’t a race on its own, the result I got within the elites was one I didn't expect, because I thought the course was too hilly for me. I was so happy with how I felt physically that day.</span></p>\n<p><b>When the off-season starts, what’s your go-to food?</b></p>\n<p><span>I went to Rome the day after the season ended last year, so I just had pizza, pasta and gelato every day.</span></p>\n<p><b>If you could only pick one race to win for the rest of your career, which would it be?</b></p>\n<p><span>Paris-Roubaix. I’ve always watched it. It’s so iconic, and doing the first edition in the rain was so monumental and the hardest thing I’ve ever done. To win that would just be like nothing else.</span></p>\n<p><b>People say that women’s cycling has improved greatly over the years, what’s something you still see as needing to change?</b></p>\n<p><span>The introduction of races like the Tour and Roubaix that weren’t on the calendar before, that’s great as they were missing. I think the TV coverage is improving, but we need to have that on par with the men just to get our racing out to a wider audience. That’s where everything lies: it gets people more engaged, and sponsors. That’s where the money comes in and then the professionalism steps up. I think our racing is so exciting to watch and when it is on TV, you can see that people do want to watch it.</span></p>\n<p><b>What’s your most played song?</b></p>\n<p><span>I’m playing Escapism right now, a song from TikTok. I’ve been playing it non-stop.</span></p>\n<p><b>Would you rather spend your time in the mountains or on the beach?</b></p>\n<p><span>In the mountains. I’m really not great with heat, and sunbathing isn’t for me.</span></p>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-Photography-06535_1024x1024.jpg?v=1685022823\" alt />Who is your sporting hero?</b></p>\n<p><span>It was always Marianne Vos and Lizzie Deignan. I remember while I was racing in Assen at about 11 years old, I was watching them come first and second at the 2012 Olympics, I just thought: I want to be like them.</span></p>\n<p><b>What does cycling bring to your life?</b></p>\n<p><span>I would say pretty much everything. My friends, my ability to travel, my life now I live in Girona… I think it’s brought me so many opportunities to meet so many people. That’s what motivates me to keep training and getting better.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any annoying habits?</b></p>\n<p><span>Probably snoring. All my team-mates say I snore.</span></p>\n<p><b>What would you pick for your last meal?</b></p>\n<p><span>I’d go for Wagamama’s chicken katsu curry, chilli squid, chicken gyoza and a brownie.</span></p>\n<p><b>Stage races or Classics?</b></p>\n<p><span>I like the nature of one-day races and the classics in Belgium with the rain, cobbles and the short punchy climbs. It’s the terrain and the conditions I seem to do well in and I think at the moment, they excite me more. I think it’s also what my physicality lends itself to, more than stage races.</span></p>\n<p><b>If you weren’t a cyclist, what would you be?</b></p>\n<p><span>Maybe an artist. I love drawing. That’s what I do when I’m not riding. I like to have one that takes two or three months to complete. I usually draw portraits, hands or animals.</span></p>\n<p><b>What’s your earliest memory of riding a bike?</b></p>\n<p><span>When I was younger I lived near Herne Hill Velodrome, so my parents took me there. They got me on a track bike and I remember on the back straight I stopped pedalling, because I got tired. I flipped over the handlebars and I cut all my arms and legs. That’s a vivid memory for me. I said I was never going to ride a bike again, but two weeks later I was back.</span></p>\n<p><b>You’re well known for your tactical skills and ability to position yourself well in a bunch. What goes through your head when the race is at its most nervous?</b></p>\n<p><span>I find it difficult if I think too much. I just try to follow a team-mate. It’s something I’ve struggled with and I worked with a mental coach, because if I think about the dangers too much, then I just end up losing places. I just try to have a focus point, I choose a wheel and follow it through and try to relax into it. You have to accept the risks but not let them overcome you. What we do is dangerous and there are risks, but you can’t think of the worst-case scenario. </span></p>\n<p><b>Finish this sentence: happiness is…</b></p>\n<p><span>Spending time with people I care about, like my friends, my family, my boyfriend. Just doing what I love, which is cycling, and then being surrounded by people that I love.</span></p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"1df68331588e00d5eab652443b427773cca5071799a42ed9ef3981f70fa0f86d","category":"Cycling"}
