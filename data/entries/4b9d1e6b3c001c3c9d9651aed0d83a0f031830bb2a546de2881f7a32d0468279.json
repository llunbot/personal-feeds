Last week, it announced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/apple-introduces-a-new-pencil-for-the-ipad-its-cheapest-yet/\">an oddball USB-C Apple Pencil</a>, and Bloomberg's usually well-informed Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p\">says</a> that a new Apple Silicon iMac refresh could arrive as soon as next week.</p>\n<p>The iMac was last updated in the summer of 2021, well over two years ago, when Apple replaced the 21.5-inch Intel model with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/24-inch-imac-review-theres-still-no-step-three/\">redesigned M1-powered Apple Silicon model</a>. Aside from the M1 MacBook Air, which Apple continues to sell as its entry-level notebook, it's the only kind of Mac that hasn't gotten some kind of M2 chip.</p>\n<p>Gurman doesn't mention them, but an updated iMac could also give Apple the opportunity to refresh its Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories with a USB-C port to match the new iPhone 15 series and the USB-C version of the AirPods. Right now, these accessories, the older iPhones Apple still sells, the Apple TV's Siri Remote, and the low-end iPad are all still using the Lightning port.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977754#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977754&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b9d1e6b3c001c3c9d9651aed0d83a0f031830bb2a546de2881f7a32d0468279","category":"Tech"}
