{"title":"Adam Engst: ‘Why I Use Mimestream for Gmail’","link":"https://tidbits.com/2023/05/24/why-i-use-mimestream-for-gmail/","date":1685387191000,"content":"\n<p>Adam Engst, writing at TidBITS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Where Mimestream shines is in its attention to visual form and\nfunctional detail — the small interface elements and features\nthat make working with email feel familiar, fluid, and fast. I\nspend hours per day in email, and while I’m willing to tweak my\nworking habits slightly to match what an app can do, I prefer it\nto accommodate my idiosyncrasies.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, I seldom delete messages. My Google account has\nplenty of space, and Gmail’s performance doesn’t degrade with\nmassive email stores, so I prefer to keep everything for posterity\nand focus my attention on unread and starred messages. So it’s\nvital that my email client supports that approach rather than\npushing its own concept of Inbox Zero or whatever philosophy it\nmight have.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t predict what refinements and affordances will make working\nwith your email a joy, so I want to share some of what I find\ncompelling about Mimestream. Many of these aren’t unique, they’re\njust very well done, and the result is that using Mimestream feels\nlike driving a well-engineered automobile instead of a low-end car\nthat feels like it was assembled from cheap, off-the-shelf\ncomponents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/29/engst-mimestream\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ce14c9791c699295f40aaaa4d0a28c0da643f892e98936a5b87413162c89a66f","category":"Tech"}
