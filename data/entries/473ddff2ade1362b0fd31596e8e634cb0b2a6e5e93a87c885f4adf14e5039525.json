Fortunately, after 24 hours of medical observation, she has avoided serious injury with no fractures reported. The cause of the crash is under investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavalli has not had the best of fortunes with injuries in recent years. She was hit from behind by a rider on Stage 2 of the Tour de France Femmes in 2022 in a horrendous crash that resulted in concussion and many months recovering before being able to race again. Cavalli‚Äôs 2023 was also affected by the after-effects, taking more time off the bike before Strade Bianche to prioritise her recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Michael M√∏rk√∏v to retire</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1e9-1f1f0.png\" alt=\"üá©üá∞\" /> VIDEO: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelMorkov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@MichaelMorkov</a> <br /><br />We are really proud and happy that the final year of your career you are spending with us, being part of the cycling history!<br />You are great champion and great teammate, Michael!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AstanaQazaqstanTeam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#AstanaQazaqstanTeam</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AstanaIsMyTeam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#AstanaIsMyTeam</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DljVPGNCjJ\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/DljVPGNCjJ</a></p>‚Äî Astana Qazaqstan Team (@AstanaQazTeam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AstanaQazTeam/status/1810204845862723654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Legendary leadout man Michael M√∏rk√∏v will retire at the end of the 2024 season.

He excelled on the track too, becoming an Olympic Champion in the Madison with Lasse Norman Hansen in 2021 and World Champion in the event in 2009, 2020 and 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video announcing his retirement, he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm very proud of what I‚Äôve achieved as a track cyclist, as a road cyclist. Being a part of the biggest races in the world, being a part of some of the biggest teams as well, being surrounded with great teammates and I‚Äôve made a lot of friendships during the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòI‚Äôm very proud of what I got out of my talent, to be honest. I was never the most talented rider as a young rider but I really managed to work hard and I feel I achieved all I could.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-tour-de-france-2024-week-one\">Was that the best first week of racing in Tour de France history?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-week-one-tour-de-france-2024\">The winners and losers of the first week of the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-women-route-live-coverage-prize-money-teams\">Giro d‚ÄôItalia Women 2024: Route, how to watch, start list and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men‚Äôs Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-andre-drege\">Pro Log: Cycling mourns Andr√© Drege, Marta Cavalli hit by driver, Michael M√∏rk√∏v to retire</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"473ddff2ade1362b0fd31596e8e634cb0b2a6e5e93a87c885f4adf14e5039525","category":"Cycling"}
