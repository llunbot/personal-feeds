Dating from early 1839 when 187 German Lutheran immigrants disembarked in Port Adelaide and negotiated the purchase of land in the Adelaide Hills, Hahndorf is recognised as Australia’s oldest surviving German settlement. How fitting that some 169 years later it was to be the scene of German sprinter André Greipel’s first official stage win at the Tour Down Under, a race he would come to dominate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2008 the event was celebrating its tenth edition as well as its newly acquired UCI ProTour status (the equivalent of a WorldTour race today). Officials were hoping the benchmark and an increasingly international peloton racing alongside the stars of Australian cycling would attract more than half a million spectators to the roadsides during the six-stage event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It would be the best possible tenth birthday present and just reward for an event that has grown in stature every year to now become the first stop in world cycling,’ Michael Rann, South Australia’s Premier at the time, commented before the race. ‘We are joining the world stage of cycling and this is our chance to show the world that our own Tour Down Under is up there with the best races in the world.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an event-opening criterium won by Greipel – a 50km affair dubbed the Down Under Classic but not considered part of the race proper – and a 129km first stage into Angaston claimed by Mark Renshaw, Stage 2 was 148 rolling kilometres among the Adelaide Hills. The route headed south from the town of Stirling, some 15km from the centre of Adelaide, switching east and north before diving back south for four laps of a 20km finishing circuit around Hahndorf.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131409/greipel-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"André Greipel\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A look at the stage profile confirms that there was barely a stretch of flat the entire stage, opening with a sharp descent from Stirling before tackling the lumpy terrain south and east of Adelaide. Yet this was still a day marked by most as one for the sprinters, as indeed was much of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘With shorter than normal stages and the majority of the riders having not raced this season yet, breakaways and big gaps may be expected by some,’ ran the race preview on <em>Cyclingnews</em>, ‘but sprinters Robbie McEwen, Graeme Brown, Mark Renshaw and Alan Davis will be willing their teammates along in the hope that each stage comes down to a mass finish.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pride of Hahndorf</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One absentee from that list of noted sprinters was Greipel. He was 25 years old and in his third season with Team High Road, having joined the then T-Mobile-sponsored outfit in 2006. Greipel had spent his first years with the team mainly riding in the service of other riders but had recorded a brace of stage wins in minor races on home roads in both 2006 and 2007. Now he had the trust of the team to target wins for himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After racing for more than three and a half hours, and having brought back the inevitable break and got over the final hill of the day, which came some 3km from the finish, the sprinters in the peloton readied themselves for the final gallop to the line. Watch the footage and you’ll see that as the line approaches Greipel is right in the mix but hemmed in on the right-hand barrier. With riders tight on his left he looks to have no way round Mark Renshaw who, wearing the ochre jersey of race leader, is at the forefront of the charge to the line, intent on recording back-to-back stage wins. Then, with around 150m to go, fortune smiles on the German.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With the line in sight, Renshaw edges to his left, nudging the door ajar for Greipel. The German doesn’t blink. He powers through the gap and, as space finally opens up, carries his speed over the line – the moment captured in this picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I feel good and I am in good shape,’ Greipel said afterwards while admitting he was lucky Renshaw had moved away from the barrier. ‘I feel like I am in Germany here. Before the race I thought it would be nice to win here. I think the people from Hahndorf are also proud of me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greipel’s Stage 2 win was the beginning of what would become a fruitful relationship with the race. He took another three stages in 2008 and claimed overall victory to record what was at the time the biggest win of his young career. And he was far from done. Over the course of 17 years in the professional ranks, Greipel made nine appearances at the race, twice winning the overall title and claiming a record 18 stage wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Greipel would of course soon be recording far bigger victories – just four months later he took his first Giro stage, opening an account that would stretch to an eventual 22 Grand Tour stage wins – that sprint into Hahndorf remained a fond memory. Talking to <em>Procycling</em> in 2016, he included the stage in a list of his ten best wins, telling the magazine that it meant a lot to him because it was the first time he was allowed to sprint for himself in a ProTour race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I had been the leadout for Gerald Ciolek in previous years, and for Cav, but I knew I could be a good sprinter. I always knew it but never got many chances, so this was the first time I could sprint by myself in a ProTour race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was really hungry to show what I could do. Being the sprinter was what I wanted. On one hand I was surprised to win [an eventual] four stages. On the other, I’d worked really hard for it and had good team support.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 149 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions/offers\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/andre-greipel-tour-down-under\">Pro race history: André Greipel bags his first win Down Under in 2008</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"614f92fc38e4cc822cbffa467028b075a845470ae25774be499f7944fb48b5df","category":"Cycling"}
