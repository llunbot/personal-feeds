The earbuds come in several colors, including a unique transparent design that shows the internals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with most of the latest Beats models, the Studio Buds + do not include an Apple audio chip, and are instead equipped with acustom Beats chip that provides better feature parity between iOS and Android devices. The Beats chip supports one-touch pairing and setup, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> integration, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> support, but automatic switching between devices is not available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe firmware update for the Beats Studio + are delivered over-the-air. Firmware will be installed while the Beats headphones are charging and are in Bluetooth range of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn Android devices, users will need to download the Beats app for Android and connect the Android device to a power outlet to initiate a firmware update.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/beats-studio-buds-plus-firmware-update/\">Apple Releases First Firmware Update for Beats Studio Buds +</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-firmware-update-for-beats-studio-buds.2435100/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60c957ac3fc7102ffffe2302a827f00bb5e224e13f420925a3d13555032b0670","category":"Apple"}
