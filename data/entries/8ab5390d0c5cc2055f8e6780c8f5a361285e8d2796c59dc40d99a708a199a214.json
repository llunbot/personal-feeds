But Precision stands out from its competitors due to a notable split from one of the most high-profile BCI companies, Neuralink, owned by controversial billionaire Elon Musk.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027276#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027276&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ab5390d0c5cc2055f8e6780c8f5a361285e8d2796c59dc40d99a708a199a214","category":"Tech"}
