During their final reviews to certify Starliner for flight nearly a year ago, engineers discovered two technical issues that somehow escaped detection for years.</p>\n<p>One of these issues involved parts of Starliner's parachute deployment system that did not meet required safety specifications. The other was a revelation that Boeing installed flammable tape wrapped around wiring bundles throughout the spacecraft, creating a potential fire hazard. These were the latest in a line of technical problems that have plagued the Starliner program, delaying the new spacecraft's first test flight with astronauts from 2017 until this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005984#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005984&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"850aa7773cad9f6e969f211e3e2f75566719c93df6b73a9b3ffdd826d44298da","category":"Tech"}
