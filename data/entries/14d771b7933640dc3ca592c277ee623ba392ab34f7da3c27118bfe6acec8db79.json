{"title":"‘2023 MLS Cup Highlights’: 5-Minute Apple Immversive Video for Vision Pro Debuts Tonight","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/apples-immersive-mls-highlight-reel-debuts-later-today/","date":1711651705000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple announced today that the first Apple Immersive Video \ndocumentary for Vision Pro, featuring highlights from last \nyear’s MLS playoffs, will debut tonight (March 28) at 6 p.m. \nPacific. [...] </p>\n\n<p>I’m excited to see the finished product — all of Apple’s \nimmersive videos have been pretty amazing — but I have to point \nout that this five-minute highlight packages is being released 110 \ndays after last year’s MLS Cup Final. That’s not <em>great</em> \nturnaround time. If immersive video for sports is going to be a \nthing, turnaround is going to need to be a lot faster. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition to the four-month turnaround time, there’s also the fact that five minutes is pretty short. Perhaps the single most surprising aspect of Apple’s launch plan for Vision Pro is the relative dearth of original immersive content. It’s the most compelling experience with the product but there’s hardly any of it. I would have thought Apple would drop new immersive content at least a few times per month, if not weekly, but this MLS Cup highlight film is the first new one since launch.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/snell-mls-highlights\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"14d771b7933640dc3ca592c277ee623ba392ab34f7da3c27118bfe6acec8db79","category":"Tech"}
