After Epic broke <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> rules by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/fornite-adds-direct-payment-option-on-ios/\">implementing a direct payment option</a>, the game was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/\">removed from the App Store</a> and Epic's developer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/17/apple-terminate-epic-developer-accounts-august-28/\">account was terminated</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA lengthy legal battle ensued, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-vs-apple-decision/\">the verdict</a> while that Apple's anti-steering conduct is anti-competitive, Apple was correct on on all other counts. ‌Epic Games‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-pays-apple-6-million/\">paid Apple $6,000,000</a> in lost royalties but has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-files-appeal-against-apple-ruling/\">appealed the verdict</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn an interview at the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/11/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-speak-app-store-conference/\">Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness</a> in Seoul, South Korea, Sweeney said:<blockquote>What the world really needs now is a single store that works with all platforms. Right now software ownership is fragmented between the iOS App Store, the Android Google Play marketplace, different stores on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, and then Microsoft Store and the Mac App Store.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSweeney added that ‌Epic Games‌ is working with developers and service providers to create a system to allow users to \"to buy software in one place, knowing that they'd have it on all devices and all platforms.\" ‌Epic Games‌ already offers the ‌Epic Games‌ Store, aimed at PC gamers, which also charges a commission.<blockquote>There's a store market, there's a payments market, and there are many other related markets. And it's critical that antitrust enforcement not allow a monopolist in one market to use their control of that market to impose control over unrelated markets.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-app-store-bill/\">South Korea passed a bill</a> that prohibits app distribution platforms from forcing developers to use their payment method alone and. Apple will be required to offer multiple in-app payment methods in South Korea, but the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/04/google-play-will-allow-alternative-billing/\">has not yet made any changes</a> to facilitate this.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nSweeney praised the legislation and accused Apple of complying \"with oppressive foreign laws\" while \"ignoring laws passed by Korea's democracy.\" \"Apple must be stopped,\" he added.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/epic-games-ceo-calls-for-single-app-store/\">Epic Games CEO Renews Attack on Apple and Calls for Single, Universal App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-ceo-renews-attack-on-apple-and-calls-for-single-universal-app-store.2323588/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nteVrKWnI7k:bTdrBfMk9Gk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nteVrKWnI7k:bTdrBfMk9Gk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ed48eecb28f33c0632cd57b4ada119723eeb5948306f0bf4c7a88b38d8152e92","category":"Apple"}
