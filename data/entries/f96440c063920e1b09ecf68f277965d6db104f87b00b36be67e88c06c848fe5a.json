[credit:\n                        Bethesda                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>If you're looking for a simple back-of-box quote about how Bethesda's newest video game works, you won't get one. The list of inspirations in <em>Deathloop</em>, out this week on PS5 and PC, is long: the time-loop conceit of <em>Zelda: Majora's Mask</em>; the multiroute sneak-and-sleuth genius of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/review-dishonored-is-stealthy-steampunk-world-building-done-right/\"><em>Dishonored</em></a>; the aesthetics and trippiness of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/we-happy-few-hands-on-a-solid-lsd-spiked-bioshock-homage-finally-emerges/\"><em>We Happy Few</em></a>; and <em>Metroid Prime</em>'s mix of backtracking and clue-hunting.</p>\n<p>What a mouthful! <em>Deathloop</em> is certainly more ambitious than yet another generic shooter, which I appreciate. The studio behind it (Arkane Lyon, creators of <em>Dishonored</em>) can't be faulted for not playing it safe. But ambition alone isn't enough.</p>\n<p>You may very well enjoy <em>Deathloop</em>'s big swingsâ€”and at their best, they combine into something special. But there's no denying the sloppiness players have to wade through to find the good stuff. Even though its core is compelling, <em>Deathloop</em> simply doesn't feel finished. Instead, it seems unpolished, like it was rushed out the door. And its die-and-retry gimmick doesn't make up for a confusing lack of world building or an egregiously small gameplay universe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793897#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793897&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f96440c063920e1b09ecf68f277965d6db104f87b00b36be67e88c06c848fe5a","category":"Tech"}
