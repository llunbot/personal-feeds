The idea behind this one is the use of CSS’s <code>:target</code> pseudo-class, which allows you to display different page content based on hash URLs (e.g. <code>#home</code>, <code>#about</code>, <code>#contact</code>, etc) and IDs on page elements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4a2dc30c-6c17-4a26-ab88-afd68d3b8e2d/54-johndoe.png\" /></p>\n<p>The only drawback to this method is the fact that search engines generally don’t recognize hash-based URL changes as separate pages.
