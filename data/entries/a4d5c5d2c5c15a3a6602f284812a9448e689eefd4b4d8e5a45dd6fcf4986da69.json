Monica grew up to become a SWORD agent, but thanks to the events of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/review-wandavision-sticks-the-landing-with-a-very-marvel-esque-finale/\"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, she can also absorb and manipulate energy as Spectrum. As for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Khan\">Khan</a>, aka Ms. Marvel, she's a teenage Pakistani American who lives in Jersey City. She's a major comic books fan, worships Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, and fantasized about becoming a superhero someday. Her powers stem from the Terrigen Mists, released globally in a crossover storyline, the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhumanity_(comics)\">Inhumanity</a>.\" The mists activated dormant Inhuman cells in several people, Kamala included.</p>\n<p>Naturally, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) will be on hand to lend some assistance, along with fan-favorite Goose the cat-shaped Flerken (played by two cats, Nemo and Tango). Saagar Shaikh, Zenobia Shroff, and Mohan Kapur will reprise their <em>Ms. Marvel</em> roles as Kamala's older brother Aamir, mom Muneeba, and dad Yusuf, respectively. Lashana Lynch will be back as Maria Rambeau (one assumes in a flashback), and Randall Park returns as Jimmy Woo. There's also a new villain called Dar-Benn, played by Zawe Ashton—the aforementioned Kree revolutionary, who wields an Accuser's hammer. Park Seo-joon (<em>Parasite</em>) has also been cast as a yet-unnamed ally of Carol, and Colin Stoneley plays a Kree scientist named Papp-Tonn.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955747#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955747&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a4d5c5d2c5c15a3a6602f284812a9448e689eefd4b4d8e5a45dd6fcf4986da69","category":"Tech"}
