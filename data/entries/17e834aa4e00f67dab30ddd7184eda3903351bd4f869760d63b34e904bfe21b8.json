Scientists developed it based on evidence and the method still works for many people.</p>\n<p>But you might not be among them. Therefore, you should consider if other types of training periodisation suit you better.</p>\n<h3>Block periodisation</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack Evans slumped over Wattbike during sodium bicarbonate lab trial\" title=\"CZ1_9840\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Block periodisation packs in interval sessions early in a training cycle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles</i></span></div>\n<p>Block periodisation puts interval-heavy weeks at the beginning of the mesocycle.</p>\n<p>The early weeks, or microcycles, of the mesocycle might have four to five interval sessions compared to one in the following weeks (a traditionally periodised training plan would have the same number every week).</p>\n<p>The rationale is that putting extra stress on certain capabilities, such as aerobic capacity, leads to greater improvement than if the training stimulus was more dispersed.</p>\n<p>Matt Fitzgerald, the founder of 80/20 Endurance coaching, says a block of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hiit-interval-training/\">high-intensity interval training</a> in conjunction with carbohydrate restriction can be an effective way to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-cycling/\">lose weight through cycling</a>.</p>\n<p>However, block periodisation can cause excessive fatigue if the athlete cannot handle the concentrated block of intervals.</p>\n<h3>Reverse periodisation</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ALTEA, SPAIN - DECEMBER 10: (L-R) Lotte Kopecky of Belgium and Demi Vollering of Netherlands during the Team SD Worx 2023 - Training Camp on December 10, 2022 in Altea, Spain.
