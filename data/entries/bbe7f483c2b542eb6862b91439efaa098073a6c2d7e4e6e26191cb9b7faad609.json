That includes an apparent practice of hiring and promoting less qualified men to roles over more qualified female applicants.</p>\n<p>The complaint was filed in a US district court in New York by Jeffrey Smith, an engineer who joined Meta in 2018. Smith alleged that Meta was on the brink of promoting him when suddenly his \"upward trajectory stopped\" after he started speaking up about allegedly misogynistic management practices at Meta.</p>\n<p>Smith claimed that instead of a promotion, his Meta manager, Sacha Arnaud, suggested that he resign shortly after delivering Smith's first-ever negative performance review, which reduced his bonus payout and impacted his company stock. Smith has alleged he suffered emotional distress and economic injury due to this alleged retaliation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032420#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032420&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbe7f483c2b542eb6862b91439efaa098073a6c2d7e4e6e26191cb9b7faad609","category":"Tech"}
