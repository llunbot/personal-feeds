There are a few new features in the update but it’s mainly filled with performance and security fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14.5: Release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Apple’s release notes for macOS Sonoma 14.5 state that the update includes the following improvements and bug fixes:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Quartiles is a new and original daily word game that is now available in Apple News+</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Scoreboard in News+ Puzzles gives you access to new player data for Crossword, Mini Crossword and Quartiles, including stats and streaks</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple notes that some features may not be available for all regions or Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14.5: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only known new features for macOS 14.5 are for News+ subscribers. There is a new game called Quartiles that joins the Crossword and Crossword mini games in the Puzzles section. The iOS 17.5 update also includes a new Scoreboard that shows stats and streaks as well as an offline mode that still gives you access to the Today feed and News+ tab when you don’t have an internet connection, so it’s likely the macOS update 14.5 includes those features as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14.5: Bug fixes and security updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sonoma 14.5 update includes <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214106&amp;xcust=1-1-2285650-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">nearly two dozen security patches</a>, including several that may lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, Apple has also fixed the following issues that affected some users: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Users might not be able to approve or decline a FaceTime link call because notifications might not be received on the caller side for them to accept or decline the call.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>macOS might launch the wrong version for (Designed for iPad) apps after double clicking the icon or after building from Xcode.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14.5: How to install the update</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to install the update on your Mac:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to System Settings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to the <em>General</em> tab, then <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Update Now next to macOS 14.5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow the onscreen prompts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Restart your Mac</li>\n</ol>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"20ca8caf0a9b064404265130d9d77988a9e2be57fc7ac1e6afc3107eb3848ceb","category":"Apple"}
