Stored in your Wallet, you can\nmake secure and contactless payments with Apple Pay from your\niPhone or Apple Watch. It’s also a way to receive daily cash back\nfor those who use Apple Card. Previously a Discover card, your\nApple Cash card is now Visa.</p>\n\n<p>Spotted by user <a href=\"https://x.com/Kanjo/status/1517427755553804288\">@Kanjo on Twitter</a>, it’s easy to notice the\ncard has a visible Visa logo in the bottom right corner. Before\nthis change, there was no Discover logo on the card. While not\neveryone will like the addition of the logo, it’s going to be hard\nto forget it’s a Visa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Apple Card is a credit card, with Goldman Sachs as the bank and Mastercard as the network. Apple definitely needs a new banking partner, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses\">as Goldman is exiting the consuming banking business</a>, and is rumored to be listening to offers from Visa and Amex to switch its network too.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Cash is a debit card, which launched on the Discover network but switched to Visa three years ago — presumably with a nice kickback to Apple to get that Visa logo on the virtual cards in Wallet.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/apple-cash-discover-visa\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a21d2a9f08e62698cdd4a23a1d67ef537443ed172c8a62bca43c8b40cd51ea5e","category":"Tech"}
