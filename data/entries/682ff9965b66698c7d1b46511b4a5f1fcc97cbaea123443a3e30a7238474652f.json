{"title":"Apple's 80% Charging Limit for iPhone: How Much Did It Help After a Year?","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/iphone-80-percent-charging-test/","date":1727212194000,"content":"With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models that came out last year, Apple added an opt-in battery setting that limits maximum charge to 80 percent. The idea is that never charging the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> above 80 percent will increase battery longevity, so I kept my ‌iPhone‌ at that 80 percent limit from September 2023 to now, with no cheating.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" />\r<br />\nMy ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max battery level is currently at 94 percent with 299 cycles. For a lot of 2024, my battery level stayed above 97 percent, but it started dropping more rapidly over the last couple of months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nI left my ‌iPhone‌ at that 80 percent limit and at no point turned the setting off or tweaked it. There were some days when I ran out of battery because I was without a charger for most of the day, and there were other times that I had to bring a battery along to make sure I didn't run out of power. It wasn't always convenient to keep it at 80 percent, but there were days when it didn't have too much of an impact.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-15-pro-max-battery-test.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIt was always a treat when the ‌iPhone‌ randomly decided to charge to 100 percent, which is something Apple has baked in to the 80 percent limit to ensure the battery level stays calibrated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the most part, I charged using USB-C rather than <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, but there was some ‌MagSafe‌ charging mixed in. There was probably a 70/30 split between wired charging and ‌MagSafe‌ charging. I did often let my battery get quite low before charging, and it didn't sit on the charger for long periods of time too often. Most charging was done in a room at 72 degrees. I'm adding this context because temperature is a factor that can affect battery longevity, and wireless charging is warmer than wired charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can compare your level battery to mine, but here are a couple other metrics from MacRumors staff that also have an ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max and did not have the battery level limited.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Current capacity: 87%. Cycles: 329</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Current capacity: 90%. Cycles: 271</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nI don't have a lot of data points for comparison, but it does seem that limiting the charge to 80 percent kept my maximum battery capacity higher than what my co-workers are seeing, but there isn't a major difference. I have four percent more battery at 28 more cycles, and I'm not sure suffering through an 80 percent battery limit for 12 months was ultimately worth it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's possible that the real gains from an 80 percent limit will come in two or three years rather than a single year, and I'll keep it limited to 80 percent to see the longer term impact.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nI did set my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max to an 80 percent limit, but I don't know if I want to continue the test given the lackluster results I had from 2023 to 2024. Will the thermal changes in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models make any difference? Maybe, maybe not. There's a 90 percent charge limit option too, and that might be more feasible than 80 percent for most people, especially those that have phones with smaller batteries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLet me know your current battery capacity and cycle count in the comments below, and weigh in on whether you think Apple's limits are worthwhile.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/iphone-80-percent-charging-test/\">Apple's 80% Charging Limit for iPhone: How Much Did It Help After a Year?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-80-charging-limit-for-iphone-how-much-did-it-help-after-a-year.2438027/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"682ff9965b66698c7d1b46511b4a5f1fcc97cbaea123443a3e30a7238474652f","category":"Apple"}
