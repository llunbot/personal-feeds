If you would prefer to use the latest official release of macOS Sequoia, here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">how to update macOS on your Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the developer beta was only available to developers who had paid to join Apple’s Developer Program (which costs $99/£79). However, for a couple of years now, Apple has opened up the developer beta to registered developers with free developer accounts. We explain how to get a free developer account below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that we recommend that you should get the beta if you aren’t a developer. Beta software tends to be buggy and a more stable public beta version is also available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you no longer want to run the beta version of macOS read this: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove the macOS beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS developer beta: Latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple released macOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 2 to developers on April 14, 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the release notes for developers:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The macOS 15.5 SDK provides support to develop apps for Mac computers running Sequoia 15.5 beta. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 16.4, available from the Mac App Store.

The Sequoia 15.5 beta 2 was released on April 14, 2025, so the public beta should be coming soon.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Sequoia 15.4 public beta\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/macos-15.4-public-beta.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sequoia beta timeline</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first version of the Sequoia developer beta of macOS 15 arrived after the WWDC keynote on June 10, 2024. Beta 2 arrived on June 24. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first public beta of Sequoia arrived on July 15, 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer beta 4 was released on July 23. The second public beta also arrived on July 23, 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer beta 5 arrived on August 5 followed by the third public beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 developer beta 6 on August 12. The fourth public beta of Sequoia arrived on August 13, 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer beta 7 and the fifth public beta of Sequoia were released on August 20. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 28, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 beta 8 and the sixth public beta of Sequoia. The release candidate of Sequoia arrived on September 9. The full version of Sequoia arrived on compatible Macs on September 16. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Sequoia 15.1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were actually two versions of the developer beta. A second beta was running concurrently with the macOS 15.0 beta development. The macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta included Apple Intelligence features that are only available on M-series Macs (a iOS 18.1 beta was also in development separately with Apple Intelligence features for compatible iPhones). Apple started work on the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta on July 29. Beta 2 arrived on August 12, beta 3 was released to developers on August 28.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, this beta was only for developers, but Apple released a macOS Sequoia 15.1 pubic beta on September 19, 2024, following the release of Sequoia to the general public. Eventually, the macOS Sequoia 15.1 release candidate was released on October 21, and a second release candidate 2 was released on October 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final version of macOS Sequoia 15.1 arrived on compatible Macs on October 28. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Sequoia 15.2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 23, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.2 beta 1 to developers. Version 15.2 introduced the second set of Apple Intelligence features. On November 20, Apple released the macOS Sequoia beta 4 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 5, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.2 Release Candidate. On December 9, Apple released the Released Candidate 2. The official release of 15.2 was on December 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Sequoia 15.3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 16, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 1 to developers. This beta includes the ability to create Gemoji.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 7, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 2 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 3 of 15.3 came on January 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.3 release candidate (RC) to developers on January 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Sequoia 15.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 19, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.4 beta to developers. It included Mail updates and Proximity Pairing with the iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 10, Apple released beta 3 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 17, Apple released beta 4 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 24, Apple released the Release Candidate 1 to developers. On March 27, Apple released a new RC that replaced the one released on March 24. On March 28, Apple released RC 2 to developers and RC 1 to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Sequoia 15.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 2, Apple released the Sequoia 15.5 beta 1 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 14, Apple released the Sequoia 15.5 beta 2 to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS public beta vs developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2023 the Developer Beta has been available to anyone who registers as a developer, even if they aren’t a paid-up member of Apple’s Developer Program. As a result, people with a basic free developer account are able to download the new macOS developer beta (we show you how to register below).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you should download the developer beta if you aren’t a developer is another question. We don’t recommend you install the developer beta if you aren’t a developer. Instead, our recommendation is to use the public beta (the first verison of which usually arrives in July).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few differences between the public and developer betas. The public beta is not the same as the beta that is released through the developer program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers get updates to their beta first, and possibly more frequently. But you should keep in mind that betas are by nature not stable, and because the public beta comes after the developer beta it could be a little safer to install. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant difference is probably the motive of the testers: Developers usually have the aim of ensuring their apps work when the updated macOS is released to the general public, while public beta testers are essentially helping Apple detect bugs and offering feedback on the features. Because of this developers may get to test new features not available in the public beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get the public beta the first thing you need to do, if you haven’t already, is join Apple’s beta programs read this for more information:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to become an Apple beta tester.</a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"How Get Public Beta Apple \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get a free developer account</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just want a free Apple Developer account so you can access the beta you can get this via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app on an iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get the Apple Developer App <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-developer/id640199958&amp;xcust=1-1-671198-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\" target=\"_blank\">from the App Store</a>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app on your iPhone. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Sign In. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wish to actually publish applications to the App Store or receive support, you’ll need to pay $99/£79 per year for a paid account. You can <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/\" target=\"_blank\">compare the free and paid accounts here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get the macOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sequoia developer beta should show up on your Mac if you are running macOS Sonoma or macOS Sequoia, have paid $99/£79 to enroll in Apple’s Developer program (<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/\">here</a>) or if you have a free developer account (follow the instructions above).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Public Beta becomes available it will also show up on your Mac, as long as you have signed up for the Public Beta program on <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s beta webpage</a>, signed the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/login_to_legal\" target=\"_blank\">NDA</a>, and <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/enroll\" target=\"_blank\">enrolled</a> your Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you download a few warnings: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We strongly advise that if you aren’t a developer you don’t download the developer beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>We also strongly recommend that you back up your Mac before you upgrade to the Sequoia beta. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>We recommend that you do not run Sequoia beta on your primary Mac; ideally, you <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672589/how-to-dual-boot-mac-run-macos-together.html\">run it in a separate volume</a>.  This should minimize any risks to you. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to download macOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Software Updates on your Mac. (System Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Updates.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You should see two options: Automatic Updates and Beta Updates.

We’ll cover that below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is the macOS beta stable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By its nature, a beta has the potential to be unstable. Therefore it’s not advised that you install it on a Mac that you rely on. If you have a second Mac that isn’t mission-critical then install it there. We strongly recommend that you don’t risk all by putting the macOS beta on your primary macOS, especially not in the early days of the beta development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have a second Mac there are a couple of ways you could run macOS beta on your Mac without running the risk of losing data or finding your Mac stops working:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We recommend installing it on a partition – which these days is really a volume (and is much easier to create than a partition was). Read about how to do that here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672589/how-to-dual-boot-mac-run-macos-together.html\">How to dual-boot Mac: Run two versions of macOS on a Mac</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alternatively, you could <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672585/how-to-install-macos-on-an-external-drive.html\">install the macOS beta on an external drive</a> and run it on that.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">safety of the macOS beta and the risks you might be taking</a> in more detail in a separate article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the stability of the beta worries you then you are probably better off waiting until the final version is out, or at least waiting until testing has been happening for a few months before getting the beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to prepare your Mac for the beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update your software</strong>: We recommend you have the latest full version of macOS installed, although Apple says that the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility requires macOS 10.8 or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make space:</strong> We’d recommend at least 15GB of available space because the macOS betas tend to be very large. If you end up requiring more space read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671020/how-to-clear-disk-space-on-a-mac.html\">How to free up space on Mac</a><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674829/how-to-delete-other-storage-on-a-mac.html\">.</a> Note that we always recommend that you have at least 10% space free on your Mac at any time, so if you don’t have that expect problems!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Back up</strong>: Before you install a beta on your Mac you should make a backup of your data and files. You can find <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670470/how-to-set-up-a-time-capsule.html\">out how to use Time Machine to back up your Mac</a>. We also have a round-up<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668696/best-mac-backup-software.html\"> of suitable backup solutions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to send feedback to Apple</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you come across an error or a bug you should use the Feedback Assistant app to provide feedback to Apple. Launch the app and follow the appropriate steps, selecting the area about which you’re providing feedback and then any specific sub-area. Then describe your issue in a single sentence, before providing a more detailed description, including any specific steps that reproduce the issue. You’ll also be able to attach other files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also have to give permission for the Feedback Assistant app to collect diagnostic information from your Mac.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Beta-Feedback-Assistant.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Beta Feedback Assistant\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Beta-Feedback-Assistant.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 758w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Beta-Feedback-Assistant.jpg?resize=300%2C227&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"758\" height=\"573\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p> </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It won’t always be obvious whether something is a bug or just not as easy to use as you might have hoped. Either way, if your feedback is that something appears to work in an illogical way, Apple will want to know that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are having trouble with a third-party app you can let Apple know by reporting it through the 3rd-party Application Compatibility category in the Feedback Assistant. However, we’d suggest that you also provide feedback to the app’s developer who will no doubt be grateful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Will I be able to update from macOS beta to the final version?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta users will be able to install the final build of the OS on release day without needing to reformat or reinstall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I talk about the beta publicly?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Apple and the license agreement all beta testers must agree to, the beta is “Apple confidential information”. By accepting those terms, you agree not to discuss your use of the software with anyone who isn’t also in the Beta Software Program.
