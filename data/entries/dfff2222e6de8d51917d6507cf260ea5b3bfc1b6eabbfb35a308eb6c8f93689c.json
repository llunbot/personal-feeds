This entitlement leads them to get upset with policy proposals that try to increase road safety by prioritizing vulnerable road users over the wants of drivers. But a new study suggests that a common complaint—taking away lanes from cars makes emergency response times go up—about traffic calming isn't actually true.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/the-us-plans-to-reduce-roadway-deaths-with-smarter-road-design/\">American roads aren't particularly safe</a>, and while much of the blame of late has been directed at <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/higher-vehicle-hoods-significantly-increase-pedestrian-deaths-study-finds/\">ever-bigger trucks and SUVs</a>, the problem is more complex than just big cars. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/how-cities-can-stem-the-tide-of-pedestrian-deaths-from-large-cars-and-suvs/\">Like the built environment,</a> standard American road design, with a pair of lanes going in either direction, makes it very easy to drive much faster than the speed limit, which is often over 25 mph.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://highways.dot.gov/safety/proven-safety-countermeasures/road-diets-roadway-reconfiguration\">road diets</a> come in—they're a relatively cheap and simple way to slow traffic and significantly cut the accident rate along a stretch of road. You take a four-lane (two-way road) and repaint it so there are now three lanes for cars: one in each direction, with a center lane in the middle for turning. The remaining space on either side becomes bike lanes (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/05/bike-lanes-need-physical-protection-from-car-traffic-study-shows/\">physically protected ones</a>, please).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039836#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039836&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
