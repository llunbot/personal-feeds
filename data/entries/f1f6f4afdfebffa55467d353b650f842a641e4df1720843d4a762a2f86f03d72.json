The therapy intravenously delivers a transgene that codes for select portions of a protein called dystrophin in healthy muscle cells; the protein is mutated in patients with DMD. Last year's initial approval occurred under an accelerated approval process and was only for use in DMD patients ages 4 and 5 who are able to walk. In the actions Thursday, the FDA granted a traditional approval for the therapy and opened access to DMD patients of all ages, regardless of ambulatory status.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032919#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032919&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f1f6f4afdfebffa55467d353b650f842a641e4df1720843d4a762a2f86f03d72","category":"Tech"}
