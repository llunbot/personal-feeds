A certain Dutchman named Mathieu is frequently seen rolling out of nearby Calpe of a spring morning. And while it might not be the hardest or longest climb in the region, the Coll de Rates – accessible, palatable, suitably challenging and beautiful – might lay claim to being the most popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 50km inland and to the north of its noisier neighbour Benidorm lies sleepy Parcent, a town with scarcely a thousand inhabitants that is still able to maintain a decent number of bike-centric businesses. The almost year-round stream of riders keen to punish themselves on the silken tarmac and recuperate on the beach keeps filling the coffers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you pull away from the town, the distinctive spire of the Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception of Parcent rises above the rest of the low-lying <em>pueblo</em>. An arrow-straight road shoots you towards the square green shoulders that obscure the horizon.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Coll de Rates\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The town boundary of Parcent marks the start of the climb, with the Catholic church of Iglesia de Santa Maria la Mayor, built on the site of an old mosque, always visible.</figcaption><figcaption>Simon Gehr</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Somewhere hidden within is the summit of the Coll de Rates. Season depending, vineyards and orchards stuffed full of grapes, oranges and lemons line the road, wafting zesty scents through the air. Come early in the year and pink-blossomed almond trees will be your consolation for lower temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something of a testing ground for pros and amateur climbers alike due to its shallow gradient and proximity to multiple cycling honey pots, the 6.5km Coll de Rates has a little something for everyone. The fastest pros tick this off in under 15 minutes at over 30kmh.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Coll de Rates\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Simon Gehr</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this category two climb is a regular in the local Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana but has also passed muster for the Vuelta a España organisers in 2001, 2010 and 2016 when ‘The Rat’ featured on stages that sometimes broke 5,000m of climbing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A brief dive into the 2016 road book records Nairo Quintana holding off Chris Froome at the end of a stage featuring the climb to extend his lead in a GC that he would eventually win while riding for Movistar.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Home comforts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Easing away from Parcent, Brits will see an odd reminder of home when passing the Victoria Restaurant, which is bedecked with the sign for the London Underground station of the same name.

Whatever message the sign is attempting to convey, it signals the start of the climbing.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Coll de Rates\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/classic-climb-coll-de-rates-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Coll de Rates summit is hard to miss as it juts out of the landscape like a rocky kneecap.</figcaption><figcaption>Simon Gehr</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Lined by thick pine trees and broken rock, clearly blasted many moons ago to make way for the highway, the road is redolent of many a climb in Spain and the Canary Islands: accommodating gradients, pine tree scent in the air and only the whizz of a freewheel or a puffing overtaker to disturb the tranquillity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking southeast through gaps in the trees, you can catch sight of the 783m Penya de Coll de Rates, a huge kneecap of grey rock that lurches out of the surrounding greenery.

As well as a helipad for those with pressing business elsewhere, 360° views are available, including of the as-yet hidden valley towards Tarbena and Cases de Bernia. If you fancy an additional 3km of climbing at more than 10%, cross the gravel car park and follow the path to the top for an even more stupendous view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warning: while you might not spot any pros on this bonus section, there are wild animals on the prowl.
