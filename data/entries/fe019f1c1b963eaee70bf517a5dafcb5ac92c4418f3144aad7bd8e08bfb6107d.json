Even so, people still created the most exceptional individual examples.</p>\n<p>The research, which will be presented at the <a href=\"https://iui.acm.org/2025/\">2025 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces</a>, reveals a nuanced picture of how AI and humans perform differently in humor creation tasks.
