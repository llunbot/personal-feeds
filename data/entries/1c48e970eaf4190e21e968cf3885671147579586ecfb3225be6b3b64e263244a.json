{"title":"Apple Seeds Fifth Beta of macOS 12 Monterey to Developers [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-5/","date":1628713516000,"content":"Apple today seeded the fifth beta of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>, the newest version of the macOS operating system. The fifth beta comes two weeks after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-4/\">released the fourth macOS Monterey beta</a>, and it is available to both developers and public beta testers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/macOS-Monterey-on-MBP-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRegistered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences. Public beta testers can install the proper profile from Apple's public beta testing website. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices, plus there's a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> to Mac feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari has been redesigned with a new tab bar (with a toggle <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">for two different designs</a> as of the third beta) and support for Tab Groups, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> has gained spatial audio, a Portrait Mode on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs, and Voice Isolation for cutting out background noise. There's also a new SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature that lets Apple users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, a separate feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and collaboration is easier with mentions and an Activity View.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Shortcuts app from iOS is now available on the Mac, and Focus helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions. There's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features, and with Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected. There are many other new features in ‌macOS Monterey‌, with a full rundown available in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">our macOS Monterey roundup</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update</b>: While Apple initially also pushed the update to public beta testers, it appears it was pulled soon after.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-5/\">Apple Seeds Fifth Beta of macOS 12 Monterey to Developers [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fifth-beta-of-macos-12-monterey-to-developers-updated.2307272/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=jz8mGvfAHGk:xC3_ebx1tug:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=jz8mGvfAHGk:xC3_ebx1tug:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/jz8mGvfAHGk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1c48e970eaf4190e21e968cf3885671147579586ecfb3225be6b3b64e263244a","category":"Apple"}
