The driver will step out of the cab and help transfer his trailer to a second rig outfitted with powerful sensors.</p>\n<p>This second truck will head south on Interstate 45 toward Houston. It will move cautiously, mostly cruising in the right lane at 65 mph despite the 75 mph speed limit.</p>\n<p>After three and a half hours, the truck will exit the freeway in Greenpoint, a neighborhood in the north of Houston. It will proceed to a second truck depot, where the trailer will again be transferred to a new rig. A different driver will get in and haul the cargo to its final destination a few miles away.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048055#p3\">Read 64 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048055&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
