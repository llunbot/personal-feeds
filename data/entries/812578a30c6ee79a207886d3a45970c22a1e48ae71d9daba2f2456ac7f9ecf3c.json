Not content with aesthetic, functional and comfort superiority, the Kelion also has green credentials thanks to the bioplastic Rilsan Clear frame. Need more info? You’ve come to the right place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cutting-edge design</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5.jpeg\" alt=\"cyclist in rudy project kelion glasses\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5.jpeg 900w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion5-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Rudy Project</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rudy Project has ensured Kelion ticks all the boxes for a modern pair of cycling glasses, with a big lens and eight colour options to match whatever kit you need. The lens is not only big though but also wraps around the head to provide a huge, unobstructed field of view and protect your eyes from dirt and bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unparalleled functionality</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"Rudy Project Kelion sunglasses optical insert\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion3.jpeg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Rudy Project</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re more than just aesthetics though, Kelion is packed with features that make cycling – and beyond – better. Firstly there’s a photochromic option, perfect for all kinds of riding but especially useful off-road and when riding in changing light conditions. Lenses are easily interchangeable too thanks a quick-change system, so you can go full sunnies in summer and put photochromics or clear lenses on when the time is right. The glasses are also compatible with an optical insert that adds a prescription lens so no one has to compromise vision to get the Kelion benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s no point having a big lens if it fogs up, so Rudy Project incorporated the Powerflow system in the bottom corners and in the top-centre of the Kelion so the lens is always clear and your full focus is always on your ride.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-647x970.jpeg\" alt=\"cyclist wearing Rudy Project Kelion sunglasses\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-647x970.jpeg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-1366x2048.jpeg 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-750x1125.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-1140x1709.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/rudy-project-kelion4-scaled.jpeg 1707w\" /><figcaption>Rudy Project</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Eco-friendly materials</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kelion also features the groundbreaking Rilsan Clear frame, which is made from a bioplastic consisting of 45% castor oil sourced from certified farmers in India. Using castor oil means Rudy Project reduces its reliance on fossil-based materials and boosts its green credentials. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Exceptional comfort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All that would be pointless if it was uncomfortable, and the Kelion has an adjustable nosepad and temple tips to make sure it sits snug, secure and comfortable on anyone who puts it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.rudyproject.com/ww/en/products/performance-eyewear/kelion.html?code=SP857877-0000\" target=\"_blank\">rudyproject.com</a></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vittoria-corsa-pro-tyres\">In The Drops: Vittoria Corsa Pro tyres, Fjällräven × Specialized backpack, Rudy Project sunglasses and The Swimmer (1968) film</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rudy-project-defender-sunglasses-review\">Rudy Project Defender sunglasses review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cycling-sunglasses-the-best-photochromic-sunglasses-for-cycling\">Buyer’s guide: best photochromic cycling sunglasses</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/rudy-project-kelion-sunglasses\">Rudy Project’s new eco-friendly Kelion sunglasses tick every box</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"812578a30c6ee79a207886d3a45970c22a1e48ae71d9daba2f2456ac7f9ecf3c","category":"Cycling"}
