The headphones did not receive Apple's H2 chip that debuted in the AirPods Pro 2 a few years ago, so they continue to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/\">miss out on Adaptive Audio features</a>, and there were no improvements to active noise cancellation either.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis means the AirPods Max continue to have the H1 chip that Apple introduced in 2019, yet the $549 headphones did not receive a price cut.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman believes that AirPods Max sales are too low for Apple to justify allocating more development resources to the headphones. So, if you are hoping for AirPods Max 2 with more significant improvements, keep your expectations low for now.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airpods-max-2-not-yet-planned/\">Apple Has 'No' Plans Yet for AirPods Max 2 With 'Meaningful' Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-no-plans-yet-for-airpods-max-2-with-meaningful-changes.2443869/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8e5c8c3e505b312a8d962a3681f39473ca32dd29f17f9bdf531d41f8d1f69888","category":"Apple"}
