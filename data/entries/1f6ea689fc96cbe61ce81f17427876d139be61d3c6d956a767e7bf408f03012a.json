A feature called “Bandwidth Boost” provides up to 120 Gbps for video content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard is built on USB4 V2, DisplayPort 2.1, and PCI Express Gen 4 and is fully compatible with previous Thunderbolt versions. This performance is achieved using a new signaling technology called “PAM-3” which should enable today’s printed circuit boards and passive cables (up to 1 meter) to achieve this performance.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Thunderbolt 4 vs 5\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thunderbolt5.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption>Intel’s comparison image shows the use cases supported by Thunderbolt 5 compared to Thunderbolt 4.</figcaption></figure><p>Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple includes Thunderbolt 4 connectors on many Mac computers and the iPad Pro, and it’s expected that future models will support Thunderbolt 5. Intel’s press release says, “Computers and accessories based on Intel’s Thunderbolt 5 controller, code-named Barlow Ridge, are expected to be available starting in 2024.” It’s unlikely that Apple will ship a product using its own controller before then, so it’s going to be <em>at least</em> 2024, and possibly 2025 before we see Macs or other Apple products with Thunderbolt 5 ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 Pro is expected to support Thunderbolt 4 when it switches from Lightning to USB-C, but it’s unlikely to support the Thunderbolt 5 standard until at least the iPhone 16.</p>\n\nApple Inc, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1f6ea689fc96cbe61ce81f17427876d139be61d3c6d956a767e7bf408f03012a","category":"Apple"}
