It is going to be very difficult for any human to pull off a John-Henry-like usurping of the new machine record, which is more than 10 times faster, at 0.305 seconds. That's within the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4043155/#RSIF20130227C2\">accepted time frame for human eye blinking</a>, which averages out to one-third of a second.</p>\n<p>TOKUFASTbot, built by Mitsubishi Electric, can actually pull off a solve in as little as 0.204 seconds on video, but not when Guinness World Records judges were measuring.

The first thing is that the world record reported is for \"fastest robot to solve a rotating puzzle cube.\" That intriguingly sidesteps the much better-known \"Rubik's Cube\" identifier. Rubik's notably <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/rubiks-cube-loses-eu-trademark-on-its-shape/\">lost its trademark</a> on any rotating 3×3×3 cube puzzle game in Europe. Perhaps Mitsubishi and Guinness simply wished to avoid touching a trademark registered to a company with a known litigation history.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029479#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029479&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"820e59d78300943daed6aafa8ba740ce96395fc3e90cc6999493f75e7418933c","category":"Tech"}
