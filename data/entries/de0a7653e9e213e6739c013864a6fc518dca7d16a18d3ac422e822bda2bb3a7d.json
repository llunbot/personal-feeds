{"title":"As WWDC nears, what does Apple have up its sleeve in May 2023?","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1799700/apple-releases-may-2023-ios-macos-apple-tv.html","date":1682939700000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s big <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC showcase is coming up on June 5</a>, which means we can probably expect May to be a pretty slow month for Apple releases. Why unveil any major new hardware or software when you have a much better opportunity in just a few weeks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have anticipated a new 15-inch MacBook Air in the spring, and maybe some other new gear, but now we think Apple is almost certainly going to wait until WWDC to release any of those products. The big star of WWDC is said to be the Mixed Reality headset (possibly named Reality Pro) but a few Mac updates might make an appearance, alongside all the new iOS, iPadOS, and macOS announcements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May we can expect the release of iOS 16.5, macOS 13.4, and the other associated OS updates, but those are rather minor. There will be some Apple TV+ releases and Apple Arcade games, but nothing that makes headlines. In fact, the conclusion of the third season of Ted Lasso–possibly the end of the entire series–might be the most notable event in Appleland this May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumored new hardware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With WWDC just around the corner, there are several new products on the way according to the rumors mill. But will we see any of them in May?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>15-inch MacBook Air:</strong> For months now we’ve been telling you of rumors that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> would launch in the spring. Now, with WWDC so close, it seems folly for Apple to simply push it out on the website only a few weeks before Tim Cook takes the stage. We now expect the 15-inch Air in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> Nope, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Apple silicon Mac Pro</a> isn’t coming in May. Wait for WWDC (and we’ve not even very sure about that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> Again, WWDC is when this would happen if it were going to get an M2 refresh. Rumor is, it’s all on hold until the M3 generation of processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reality Pro headset:</strong> While Apple won’t even acknowledge the existence of its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">AR headset</a> until WWDC in June, May will be a fun time to follow the news about it. This is Apple’s biggest product in over a decade, and the rumors are really going to start flying in the lead-up to its unveiling. We might even get a reliable leak showing us what it looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The big software updates are coming at WWDC with the introduction of iOS 17, macOS 14, and watchOS 10. Developer betas for those will start right away, with public betas probably a few weeks later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Apple wraps up the iOS 16 and macOS 13 development, the updates are fairly minor. We’ll get what might be the last update for iOS 16 or macOS 13, outside of security releases and bug fixes, in May. And they’re not terribly exciting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 16.5:</strong> This release doesn’t add much more than a Sports tab in Apple News and some Siri and Shortcuts functions for screen recording, plus the usual bug fixes and security improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‌<strong>tvOS 16.5:</strong> Keeping in line with the iOS release, you’re not going to notice much in the way of new stuff on your Apple TV with this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPadOS 16.5:</strong> The same features coming to iOS 16.5 come to your iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS 13.4:</strong> Bug fixes and security updates, plus macOS gets the simplified beta installation process that came to iOS and iPadOS in 16.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
