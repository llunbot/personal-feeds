The study is published in the Nature Medicine journal.</p>\n<p>“We’ve developed a precision medicine approach that has successfully managed our patient’s treatment-resistant depression by identifying and modulating the circuit in her brain that’s uniquely associated with her symptoms,” said Andrew Krystal, UCSF professor of psychiatry.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801186#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801186&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"31090813487529538b11f393762b3d8cb6e94826dcabcd29c8d427be2ffa5f9d","category":"Tech"}
