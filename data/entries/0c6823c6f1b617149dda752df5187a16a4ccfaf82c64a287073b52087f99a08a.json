Whether it’s logging into Amazon, checking your online banking or settling down to watch something on Netflix, seeing the log-in box appear can make your heart sink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the fact that each site seems to require a different length or combination of certain characters, meaning you need different ones for nearly every site or service (which, sadly, is also a good idea). How are our limited human brains supposed to store all these weird strings of letters, numbers and special characters? All I want to do is stream Star Trek: The Next Generation for the 50th time, not prove my intellectual prowess! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password managers can help you manage all your passwords and login information across your Mac, iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices. Apple offers it’s own Passwords app to keep track of all your passwords, but is that the best password manager for Mac and iPhone, or is there another password manager for Apple devices that would do a better job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve reviewed lots of password manager that work with Macs, iPhone and iPads to see how they compare and whether the extra features on offer are worth the extra expense when compared to Apple’s free Passwords app. In a nutshell, it is wise to get a password manager that isn’t limited to Apple devices, especially if within your family unit there are other kinds of devices. Read on to find our why you need a password manager and which password managers are best for Apple devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><p>PROMOTION</p><p><strong>RoboForm Premium: Just $0.99/Month!</strong></p></div><div><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Desktop-Light-1.png?w=1240&amp;h=697&amp;crop=1\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div><p>\n</p><p>Secure your passwords with RoboForm Premium—now only $0.99/month, a massive 60% off!

If you use a Password Manager you only need to remember one master password, after which the app takes care of logging into all other accounts. Some apps even make recommendations for really secure passwords, others will tell you if there is a risk that your password has been leaked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our round up we’ve included Apple’s Password app at the top because it’s free and already on your device (as long as your Mac or iPhone has iOS 18 or macOS Sequoia or later). However, there are other good password managers, such as the award winning 1Password, feature heavy Dashlane and easy to use NordPass.

It stores and fills login passwords, Wi-Fi passwords, 2FA codes, and passkeys. It warns you of easy-to-guess passwords, reused passwords, and passwords that appeared in major data breaches. It’s also relatively easy to securely share passwords with others. Apple also provides its own suggested passwords for new signups.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t give you much in the way of other features–stored credit card and identification info to autofill in forms, secure document storage or notes, and so on. Apple has other apps that do those things in encrypted ways, but if you use other platforms and browsers, this information is not easily available.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing the font size on the 2FA codes by a few points would help. There’s text at the top of the Codes screen that shows you how long until the codes reset, but it scrolls off the top of the screen when you scroll down your list–it should stay anchored at the top of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s Passwords app gets the job done and is fine for the bulk of Apple users who don’t regularly use other platforms or browsers. If you use the required extrensions it will even work for those who use Chrome, Edge – and even Windows. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2583512/apple-passwords-review-free-and-simple-password-manager.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPasswords review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1Password – Best password manager \t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"1Password - Best password manager \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1Password-Watchtower.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14 day trial.

This recent history makes it harder to recommend.</p>\n\n<p>Not that security measures aren’t there, the company explains that it uses “AES 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes to ensure complete security in the cloud.” The app does all of its encryption locally, so LastPass never knows your master password, and the Premium tier also supports a form of two-factor authentication for another layer of security. </p>\n\n<p>You can either use LastPass locally on your device via dedicated apps (macOS, iOS and iPadOS), or via the web with plugins and extensions available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge all of which allow you to automatically access login details for sites and accounts or have LastPass autofill the login fields on your behalf. </p>\n\n<p>Just like with other managers you have access to a vault where all of your passwords are stored, and these can be changed to more complex alternatives at the touch of a button. LastPass will also advise you on how secure your passwords are for your existing accounts. Getting set up is easy too, as you can import existing passwords from web browsers, email, and other password managers. </p>\n\n<p>The app offers a digital wallet to store your card details, plus another area for official ID such as passports and driving licenses. The Note section is a place where you can keep Wi-Fi passwords, insurance details and any other important documents that you need to access. It’s also possible to securely share account details and logins with friends and family, even if they don’t have LastPass. </p>\n\n<p>There is a free tier, although this is limited to one device, so if you want to sync across your Mac and iPhone you’ll need to move up to the Premium tier, which is a annual subscription. One of the advantages of a paid plan is an Emergency backup which means that, should you suffer an accident or even pass away, your family will be given access to your account.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2281756/lastpass-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLastPass review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnpass\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"Enpass\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Best-password-manager-ENPASS-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFree tier; From $1.99 per month, $23.99 a year\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Enpass (annually)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$23.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.enpass.io\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Those looking for a simple, secure solution that doesn’t break the bank would do well to consider Enpass.</p>\n\n<p>The macOS client is completely free, but if you want to add the same features to your iPhone or Android device then you’ll need to move to the Enpass Premium tier.

Most people don’t use a password manager at all, so getting them in the door this way is a good thing – and Apple Passwords is definitely good enough for most everyday users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more ways to keep your data safe, read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668652/iphone-security-tips-how-to-protect-your-phone-from-hackers.html\">iPhone security</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432223/mac-security-tips-password-find-my-users-lockdown-mode.html\">Best Mac security tips</a> articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need some help coming up with a safe and secure password? Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1807351/create-safe-password-tips.html\">tips to make your passwords even stronger</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need to use passkeys?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple and other tech companies are encouraging the use of passkeys. This is a system that uses encrypted keys for account authentication. You have one key and the website has another and when you attempt to log in the two keys pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys improve security, but for now they haven’t been widely adopted,  but that is likely to change in time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashlane, NordPass, and 1Password already support passkeys. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test password managers </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When evaluating password managers we assess the different features on offer, focussing on ease of use – because let’s face it, if it’s too much hassle people won’t use their password manager and they will ignore its warnings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another area we check is cross-platform compatibility, because a password manager should work across all your devices. If you aren’t only in the Apple ecosystem you need a password manager that will assist you outside as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also important are the security features, so we look out for good encryption, multi-factor authentication, and strong password generation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally we look at the additional features, like how easy it is to share with family and friends, and what happens if you pass away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Price is also assessed. Many password managers have a yearly subscription so we feel it is important to assess whether the password manager will still feel as valuable a year from the date you first start to use it. Especially as moving to an alternative can be a stressful process. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why you can trust Macworld</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld is a team of Apple enthusiasts with decades of experience with, and expertise in, all things Apple. We offer fair and honest reviews and unbiased buying advice based on our own practical experience with the products. Our testing process is rigorous and we frequently look again at software to ensure that it still meets our requirements and the needs of our readers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How password managers work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of password managers is to simplify the way you access your various accounts. Instead of having to memorize multiple complex passwords for each of the services you use you need only recall one password – or provide a fingerprint or Face ID – and the password manager will automatically fill in the required details for you. Just remember this is only as safe as the password you use to unlock access to all your passwords – so don’t lock them all behind an easy-to-guess password, like your pet’s name.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The password managers also offer various other features. For example, they can generate random, highly secure passwords for your accounts, they can warn you if your password has been compromised, and some can advise you about existing insecure passwords and support your efforts to update them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, security is a high priority—as the manager apps have the virtual keys to your kingdom—which is why all of the options listed use high-grade encryption to protect your details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many also feature digital wallets so your bank details can be safely stored and used to make purchases online without having to root around in your pocket or bag for the card number and expiry date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good Password Manager makes it easy to use strong, unique passwords everywhere on the web, no matter what platform or browser you happen to use. But to get the most out of them, you need to pay a subscription fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose the best password manager </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First decide which of the features you need from those mentioned above and then look for a password manager that offers them.

A good password manager will allow you to do that without sacrificing security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important that the password manager has good security, because it holds the key to all of your data, including bank account and address probably. So make sure that you have protection for this information, which is usually two-factor authentication so that your password can’t be hacked without access to a trusted device via a second method of identification. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are password managers safe?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Good password managers will offer enhanced security features beyond basic protection. They encrypt all stored data, making it highly unlikely cybercriminals can decrypt it. Since all passwords will be encrypted, hackers shouldn’t be able to view them even after theft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the strength of your master password is crucial. If you’re concerned, consider choosing a password manager that stores your master password on a separate server, adding an extra layer of security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should there be a security incident, a reputable managers should publicly release details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you suspect a hack, determine if it’s your data or the password manager’s database. If the database is hacked, you can decide whether to continue using the service. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I switch password managers?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Problems can arise if you are trying to switching from an existing Password Manager.
