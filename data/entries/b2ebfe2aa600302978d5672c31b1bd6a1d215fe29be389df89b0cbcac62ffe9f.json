Production generally requires the use of chemicals derived from fossil fuels, and so helps to continue our reliance on them. And the final products are generally not biodegradable, so they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/01/plastic-is-everywhere-including-our-food-and-bottled-water/\">tend to stick around</a> despite breaking down into <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/airborne-microplastics-aid-in-cloud-formation/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">ever smaller fragments</a>.</p>\n<p>Biology might ultimately provide a solution, however. Researchers have identified bacteria that evolved the ability to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/does-newly-discovered-bacteria-recycle-plastic/\">digest some plastics</a>. And improvements in our ability to design proteins have allowed us to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/\">make new enzymes</a> that can chew up plastics.</p>\n<p>This week brings some progress on the other side of the equation, with a team of Korean researchers describing how they've engineered a bacterial strain that can make a useful polymer starting with nothing but glucose as fuel. The system they developed is based on an enzyme that the bacteria use when they're facing unusual nutritional conditions, and it can be tweaked to make a wide range of polymers.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/researchers-engineer-bacteria-to-produce-plastics/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/researchers-engineer-bacteria-to-produce-plastics/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2ebfe2aa600302978d5672c31b1bd6a1d215fe29be389df89b0cbcac62ffe9f","category":"Tech"}
