Whether starting or ending your ride in the cold, or changing elevation or microclimates, a wind vest is an absolute necessity on many rides. But when you’re not wearing it, it’s nice to have one that doesn’t take up much room in your pocket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where products like the Ornot Lightweight Vest come in. Weighing in at just 75g, the vest packs down into its own storage pocket roughly the size of a cell phone. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Golden_02-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Golden_02-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Ornot lightweight vest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Golden_02-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Golden_02-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Golden_02-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Golden_02-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Golden_02-2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Navy_06-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Navy_06-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Ornot lightweight vest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Navy_06-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Navy_06-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Navy_06-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Navy_06-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Mens_LW_Vest_Navy_06-2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Constructed from 40 gsm ripstop fabric with Oeko-Tex certified recycle fibers, the vest also has a CO DWR finish on the front to repel moisture. The back however is a super breathable, open knit to allow heat to escape while the front blocks the wind. The Clement Golden color is highly visible, but both it and the Navy vest have reflective accents for low-light conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Navy_04-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Navy_04-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Ornot lightweight vest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Navy_04-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Navy_04-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Navy_04-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Navy_04-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Navy_04-2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Golden_03-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Golden_03-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Ornot lightweight vest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Golden_03-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Golden_03-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Golden_03-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Golden_03-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ornot_Womens_LW_Vest_Golden_03-2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Available in Men’s or Women’s cuts in the same two colors, pricing is set at $98 with sizes from XS to XXL. We assume this might be part of their upcoming Black Friday sale as well, which is for 36h only. Their website currently lists it as Nov. 22nd, but I’m assuming that’s supposed to say Nov. 29th on the actual Black Friday. We’ll follow up when we hear back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ornotbike.com/products/mens-lightweight-vest-golden\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ornotbike.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ornot-adds-lightweight-vest-75g/\">Ornot Adds Lightweight Vest That Fits in Your Pocket, Weighs 75g</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"2f148125df1a8eab0b5570c9f073208b27a0162c231298abc15ff6480c3271ec","category":"Cycling"}
