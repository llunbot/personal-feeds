Apps in the United States’","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596?cid=mc-ols-bytedance-article_121596-os_ui-12132024","date":1737478591000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Support document, which is linked from the App Store if you search for any of the apps from ByteDance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where\nit operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign\nAdversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance\nLtd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and\nothers — will no longer be available for download or updates on\nthe App Store for users in the United States starting January 19,\n2025. [...]</p>\n\n<p>If you already have these apps installed on your device, they will\nremain on your device. But they can’t be redownloaded if deleted\nor restored if you move to a new device. In-app purchases and new\nsubscriptions are no longer possible.</p>\n\n<p>Users in the United States won’t receive updates for these apps,\nwhich could potentially impact performance, security, and\ncompatibility with future versions of iOS and iPadOS, and some app\nfunctions might become limited or stop working since the app can’t\nreceive updates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok\">My take from Sunday</a> on Trump’s reprieve-by-executive-fiat seems correct: it has no bearing on the law. Really, all his executive order does is instruct the Justice Department (or as he would call it, <em>his</em> Justice Department) not to enforce the law for 75 days, and to promise any company that violates the PAFACA law that they won’t be prosecuted for it. There’s really no question about it: Oracle and Akamai are violating the law by providing services to TikTok users in the United States. They’re simply taking Trump at his word that the law will not be enforced and they will not face penalties for violating it during Trump’s completely arbitrary 75-day grace period.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not like a pardon. Trump’s executive order yesterday carries no more legal weight than a Monopoly “Get Out of Jail Free” card. I don’t think it will happen but there’s nothing that would stop the Trump Justice Department from changing its mind and prosecuting Oracle and Akamai for these violations. It’s up to Trump. There’s also nothing that would stop a future Justice Department under a post-Trump administration from holding them accountable for this.</p>\n\n<p>Apple and Google are both sticking with the actual law. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/21/apple-support-bytedance\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f10b495d4d0dcf7c04b48a9a847f62fb72d789cb86e32909907992e223071bd0","category":"Tech"}
