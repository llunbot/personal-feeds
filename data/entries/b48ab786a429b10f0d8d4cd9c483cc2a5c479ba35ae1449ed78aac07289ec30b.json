This is partly due to the fact that hardware products destined for launch next year require software for testing purposes, but it is currently too early to know what sort of features the new operating systems will offer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also said that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/\">Vision Pro headset should gain Apple Intelligence</a> as soon as next year, so this could make sense for ‌visionOS‌ 3. Meanwhile, the public beta versions of ‌iOS 18‌, macOS 15 Sequoia, ‌watchOS 11‌, and ‌visionOS 2‌ should arrive next month ahead of official release in the fall.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/apple-starts-work-on-ios-19-and-macos-16/\">Apple Reportedly Starts Work on iOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-starts-work-on-ios-19-macos-16-watchos-12-and-visionos-3.2430409/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b48ab786a429b10f0d8d4cd9c483cc2a5c479ba35ae1449ed78aac07289ec30b","category":"Apple"}
