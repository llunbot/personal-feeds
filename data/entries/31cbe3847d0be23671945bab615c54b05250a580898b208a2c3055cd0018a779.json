The studio is dealing with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/ca-state-agency-sues-activision-blizzard-alleges-discrimination-against-women/\">lawsuit</a> filed by the State of California in July over employee claims of sexual discrimination and harassment, and its recent public defense was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-letter-172540779.html\">ill-received</a>.
