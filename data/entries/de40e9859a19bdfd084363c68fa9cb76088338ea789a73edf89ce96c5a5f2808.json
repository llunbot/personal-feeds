Within this, he revealed that one of the main upgrades for the high-end ‌iPhone‌ 18 models will apparently be variable aperture on the rear wide camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro, 15 Pro, and 16 Pro's main cameras feature a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78. A variable aperture on future ‌iPhone‌ models would allow the main camera to control the amount of light entering the lens, allowing it to adjust to different lighting conditions. It also would provide more control over depth of field, enabling sharper focus on subjects or smoother background blur.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo believes that Sunny Optical and Luxshare will be the primary and secondary shutter suppliers, while the variable aperture lens will be supplied by Sunny Optical and Largan Precision. The ‌iPhone‌ 18 is expected to launch in 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/largan/\">Largan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luxshare/\">Luxshare</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/variable-aperture-rumored-for-iphone-18-pro/\">Variable Aperture Rumored to Bring Major Camera Upgrade to iPhone 18 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/variable-aperture-rumored-to-bring-major-camera-upgrade-to-iphone-18-pro.2442310/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"de40e9859a19bdfd084363c68fa9cb76088338ea789a73edf89ce96c5a5f2808","category":"Apple"}
