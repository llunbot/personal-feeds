The company has <a href=\"https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-changes-to-our-device-portfolio-featuring-Nest-Protect-and-Nest-x/ba-p/708064\">just announced</a> two of its home gadgets will be discontinued, one of which is quite popular. The Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector is a common fixture in homes, but Google says it has stopped manufacturing it. The less popular Nest x Yale smart lock is also getting the ax. There are replacements coming, but Google won't be making them.</p>\n<p>Nest launched the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/smoke-alarms-get-smart-four-months-with-the-nest-protect/\">2nd gen Protect</a> a year before it became part of Google. Like all smoke detectors, the Nest Protect comes with an expiration date. You're supposed to swap them out every 10 years, so some Nest users are already there. You will have to hurry if you want a new Protect. While they're in stock for the moment, Google won't manufacture any more. It's on sale for $119 on the Google Store for the time being.</p>\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nestxyale.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nestxyale.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nestxyale-640x436.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nestxyale-768x524.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nestxyale-980x668.jpg 980w\" />\n      The Nest x Yale lock.\n        Credit:\n          Google\n      \n<p>Likewise, Google is done with the Nest x Yale smart lock, which it launched in 2018 to complement the Nest Secure home security system. This device requires a Thread-enabled hub, a role the Nest Secure served quite well. Now, you need a $70 Nest Connect to control this lock remotely. If you still want to grab the Nest x Yale smart lock, it's on sale for $229 while supplies last.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-discontinues-nest-protect-smoke-alarm-and-nest-x-yale-lock/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-discontinues-nest-protect-smoke-alarm-and-nest-x-yale-lock/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b256754b4edfcf1d9fe12fc38ff800187785496146be617a3d82e4640dca3402","category":"Tech"}
