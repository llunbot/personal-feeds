Biden Jr. was diagnosed Friday with an\naggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones,\nhis office said in a statement on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms,\nwhich led doctors to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/biden-prostate.html\">find a “small nodule”</a> on his\nprostate. Mr. Biden’s cancer is “characterized by a Gleason\nscore of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,” the\nstatement said.</p>\n\n<p>“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the\ncancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective\nmanagement,” according to the statement from Mr. Biden’s office,\nwhich was unsigned. “The president and his family are reviewing\ntreatment options with his physicians.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Terrible news about a good man. But, man, does it feel like forever ago that he was president. It was only 118 days ago.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/18/biden-cancer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6467dd0ca4f8a292a05e76269a89e2cd0babcfaf5178aa374c19f3adf89d6c98","category":"Tech"}
