It has been designed to serve as an \"entirely reimagined destination for the LA community\" to learn about Apple's product and services.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the last several years, Apple has been making an effort to redesign and update some of its older stores, and locations like The Grove that have outgrown their original size have been revamped. Apple recently relocated <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/valleyfair/\">Apple Valley Fair</a>, a Bay Area location with higher traffic than could be accommodated at the original location, and it has expanded other flagship stores such as <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/fifthavenue/\">Apple Fifth Avenue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/unionsquare/\">Apple Union Square</a> in San Francisco.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/19/apple-the-grove-reopening/\">Apple Celebrates Opening of The Grove Apple Store in LA With Ted Lasso Appearance</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-celebrates-opening-of-the-grove-apple-store-in-la-with-ted-lasso-appearance.2324114/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j6zWb21YpZ4:lymGdiE9GDA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j6zWb21YpZ4:lymGdiE9GDA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dc79fb6ee056a119542c2b41b8adbb2a5dc06aa7d96d0dace3126c8abb2b84d4","category":"Apple"}
