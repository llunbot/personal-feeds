The negative attention is potentially a sign that OpenAI has entered a new level of public visibility—and is more prominently receiving pushback to its AI approach beyond what it has seen from tech pundits and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/chasing-defamatory-hallucinations-ftc-opens-investigation-into-openai/\">government regulators</a>.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI's rough week started last Monday when the company previewed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/\">a flirty AI assistant</a> with a voice seemingly inspired by Scarlett Johansson from the 2013 film <em>Her</em>. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666\">alluded to</a> the film himself on X just before the event, and we had previously <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/people-are-speaking-with-chatgpt-for-hours-bringing-2013s-her-closer-to-reality/\">made that comparison</a> with an earlier voice interface for ChatGPT that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/chatgpt-goes-multimodal-with-image-recognition-and-speech-synthesis/\">launched</a> in September 2023.</p>\n<p>While that September update included a voice called \"Sky\" that some have said sounds like Johansson, it was GPT-4o's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/is-the-world-ready-for-an-ai-assistant-that-can-laugh-in-your-face/\">seemingly lifelike</a> new conversational interface, complete with laughing and emotionally charged tonal shifts, that led to a widely circulated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVMNvm67Y-A\"><em>Daily Show</em> segment</a> ridiculing the demo for its perceived flirty nature. Next, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPH0HgotIE4\"><em>Saturday Night Live</em> joke</a> reinforced an implied connection to Johansson's voice.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025400#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025400&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"89ae82c20a31f24d785ba59602718e956ec90c51fb56e03cdcfed3ad8d1ec11c","category":"Tech"}
