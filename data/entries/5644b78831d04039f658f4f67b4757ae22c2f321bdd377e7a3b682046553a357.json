They are similar in some ways to early iterations of Snapchat Spectacles but with a more stylish aesthetic that looks right in line with other Ray-Ban glasses.</p>\n<p>The glasses have two front-facing cameras, each at 5 megapixels. Users can take a photo either with a touch gesture or with a \"Hey Facebook\" voice command. In order for people in the room to be able to tell that pictures or video are being taken, a white LED on the front of the frames will light up. Videos can be as long as 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Photos and videos taken with the glasses are sent to a new smartphone app called Facebook View, which offers essential editing and sharing capabilities. In addition to photo and video capture, the glasses allow you to take calls or listen to music and podcasts with built-in speakers and microphones.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793201#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793201&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5644b78831d04039f658f4f67b4757ae22c2f321bdd377e7a3b682046553a357","category":"Tech"}
