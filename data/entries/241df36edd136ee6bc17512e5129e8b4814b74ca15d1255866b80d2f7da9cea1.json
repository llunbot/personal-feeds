The new devices will directly compete with Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup, and unsurprisingly, AI is a major focus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br />\nSamsung hasn't made major changes to the look of its Galaxy S25 devices, but the S25 Ultra has rounded edges for a more comfortable grip, and Samsung says that it is the slimmest, lightest, and most durable Ultra device to date. It continues to have a 6.9-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, while the Galaxy S25+ offers a 6.7-inch display and the Galaxy S25 offers a 6.2-inch display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/samsung-galaxy-smartphones.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nThe smartphone has a titanium shell and Corning's Gorilla Armor 2 for the front display, which Samsung says is more durable than glass. Gorilla Armor 2 is like Apple's Ceramic Shield, and it is made from a glass-ceramic material that is meant to improve drop protection and cut down on scratches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Updated Galaxy Chip</h2>\r<br />\nAll three of the new smartphones are equipped with a customized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip that is built on a 3-nanometer process. There is a 37 percent improvement in CPU performance, a 30 percent improvement in GPU performance, and a 40 percent improvement in neural processing and image processing compared to the S24 lineup. Samsung says that the new chip makes it possible to process more AI experiences on-device, mirroring one of Apple's key artificial intelligence aims.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung added a Vulkan Engine for improved ray tracing to compete with Apple devices on the mobile gaming front, and there is a 40 percent larger vapor chamber along with thermal improvements for better heat dissipation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Camera Technology</h2>\r<br />\nThere is a new 50-megapixel ultra wide lens for the S25 Ultra, which joins the 200-megapixel wide lens and the 50-megapixel 5x telephoto lens with 100x space zoom and 10x AI-powered \"optical quality\" zoom. The upgraded ultra wide lens is an S25 Ultra exclusive, and it makes a big improvement to macro shots.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n10-bit HDR recording is a default option, which provides \"four times richer color expression\" for better detail in any lighting condition. Samsung says that the S25 devices are able to analyze movement and time to better reduce noise, providing clearer low-light videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung mimicked an ‌iPhone 16‌ audio feature, adding Audio Eraser for video. Audio Eraser isolates categories of sounds like voices, music, wind, nature, and crowds to tone down or eliminate excess noise. Apple did something similar with Audio Mix for improving the sound captured in videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung updated its built-in Filters feature to include new analog filters with a film-like aesthetic for photos and videos, which is akin to Apple's Photographic Styles feature for the ‌iPhone 16‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a new Virtual Aperture option for controlling depth-of-field, and Galaxy Log recording is available for precise color grading for professional video production.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AI Improvements</h2>\r<br />\nAccording to Samsung, the S25 series includes a \"true AI companion\" that understands the context of user needs and provides personalized AI experiences. Here are the new AI features:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Personal Data Engine</strong> - Uses on-device learning to provide \"highly tailored experiences\" such as the Now Brief.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Now Brief</strong> - There is a Dynamic Island-like \"Now Bar\" on the that contains a \"Now Brief\" that guides users through their day.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Circle to Search</strong> - This existing AI option now supports phone numbers, email, and URLs. You can call, email, or visit a website with a tap.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Quick GIFs</strong> - Circle to Search works in all kinds of new ways. If you circle a video in the YouTube app, for example, you can create a wallpaper or a GIF, adding the number of frames from the video that you want.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Quicker Photo Editing</strong> - Samsung's generative editing features provide suggestions on what to remove from a photo, and the actual removal is an improvement over what's available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Actionable searches</strong> - The S25 supports interactive search with context-aware suggestions for next steps. When you highlight anything with an Circle to Search, you can get suggested actions.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Natural language</strong> - Samsung says that the S25 series supports a \"breakthrough in natural language understanding.\" Users can ask for things like a specific photo in the gallery, to adjust settings, and more.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Third-party integration</strong> - Gemini, which can be activated by pressing the side button, can perform actions between Samsung apps, Google apps, and third-party apps like Spotify.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Multi-step commands</strong> - Gemini and Galaxy AI work together to complete multiple tasks with a single command. For example, you can ask the S25 to find the next few games for your favorite sports team, and add them to your calendar while also sending a link to a contact.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Portrait Studio</strong> - The Portrait Studio for the camera has been improved for creating personalized avatars that have more true-to-life facial expressions.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nOne of the main new features is the Now Brief, which can be found in the Now Bar. The Now Bar looks a lot like the ‌iPhone‌'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, and it displays information from select apps throughout the day. In the morning, it displays a morning brief with sleep scores, top news headlines, weather, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/samsung-morning-brief.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nLater in the day, it can provide live sports scores, info from Google Maps, timers, and more. It's also interactive, like the ‌Dynamic Island‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Pricing and How to Buy</h2>\r<br />\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is <a href=\"https://howl.link/abx8a0atqckdm\">priced starting at $1,300</a> for 256GB of storage. The S25+ is <a href=\"https://howl.link/z3i0rxxjy4ocj\">more affordable at $1,000</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/z3i0rxxjy4ocj\">the S25 is priced</a> to compete with the ‌iPhone 16‌ at $800.
