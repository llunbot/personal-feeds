Dirtskirt is a simple concept. A small stick-on cover keeps loam out of your lower link – and potentially damaging rocks too. Now a new universal design and an all-new material mean Dirtskirt v2 will protect hundreds of models of bikes from at least 28 different mountain bike brands!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Foxfolk Dirtskirt v2 universal MTB frame protector</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"797\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre-800x797.jpg\" alt=\"fox folk dirtskirt lower link frame protection\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre-800x797.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre-297x296.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre-768x765.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre-1536x1529.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dirtskirt-raisondetre.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c. Foxfolk</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you familiar with the plague of the “Loam Shelf”?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many (<em>dare I say, most?</em>) modern carbon full-suspension mountain bikes suffer from a small gap between the rear triangle/chainstay yoke and the bottom bracket – right in the path of dirt, rocks &amp; debris flying off your rear wheel. Some bike brands make an effort to protect that gap, but many ignore it. There’s almost always cables routed through it, too. Of course dirt, pine needles, and mud are going to get in there. But mostly you can rinse them out. But some inopportunely-placed small rocks can even get wedged inside and wreak havoc on your carbon frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foxfolk’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/foxfolk-dirtskirt-offers-frame-protection-for-stumpjumper-stumpjumper-evo/\" target=\"_blank\">original Dirtskirt</a> was an EVA foam mini-fender that closed the gap on Specialized Stumpjumpers and Stumpy Evos. Now they are back with Dirtskirt v2 for the masses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Foxfolk Dirtskirt v2 universal full-suspension mountain bike MTB frame protector, teaser\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_teaser.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Dirtskirt v2 is a universal fit that New Zealand-based Foxfolk promises will offer “<em>lower linkage frame protection for over 28 premium MTB brands</em>“. That will work because they’ve switched to a new symmetric molded silicone design that they say can adapt to pretty much any symmetric or asymmetric lower link/chainstay yoke configuration. And you can even trim it to fit if needed. So 28 brands of mountain bikes is probably a conservative estimate, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the original, you’ll simply stick it in place. And in return you will get long-lasting frame protection from debris penetration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Foxfolk Dirtskirt v2 – Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"885\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand-800x885.jpg\" alt=\"Foxfolk Dirtskirt v2 universal full-suspension mountain bike MTB frame protector, in-hand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand-800x885.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand-271x300.jpg 271w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand-108x120.jpg 108w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand-768x850.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand-1388x1536.jpg 1388w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Foxfolk-Dirtskirt-v2-universal-full-suspension-mountain-bike-MTB-frame-protector_complete-in-hand.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new universal fit silicone Dirtskirt v2 will sell for $40, including installation adhesive (<em>plus shipping</em>).
