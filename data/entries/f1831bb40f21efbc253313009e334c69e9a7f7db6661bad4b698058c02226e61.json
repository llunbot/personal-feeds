The team will be run by Rick Osterloh, who was previously \nthe SVP of devices and services, overseeing all of Google’s \nhardware efforts. Hiroshi Lockheimer, the longtime head of \nAndroid, Chrome, and ChromeOS, will be taking on other projects \ninside of Google and Alphabet. </p>\n\n<p>This is a huge change for Google, and it likely won’t be the last \none. There’s only one reason for all of it, Osterloh says: AI. \n“This is not a secret, right?” he says. Consolidating teams “helps \nus to be able to do full-stack innovation when that’s necessary,” \nOsterloh says. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m sure this <em>is</em> about AI, but I think it’s also about getting the company’s shit together and forming a cohesive strategy for integration with their consumer devices. Lost amid the schadenfreude surrounding the near-universal panning of Humane’s AI Pin is the question of, well, what <em>are</em> the device form factors we need for AI-driven features? I would argue, strenuously, that the phone is the natural AI device. It already has: always-on networking, cameras, a screen, microphones, and speakers. Everyone owns one and almost everyone takes theirs with them almost everywhere they go.</p>\n\n<p>Putting all of Android under a new division led by the guy in charge of Pixel devices since 2016 says to me that Google sees AI not primarily as a way to make Android better, in general, but to make Pixel devices better, specifically. Best-of-class AI, only on Pixels, could be the sort of differentiation that actually results in Pixels gaining traction.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/18/google-reorg-under-devices\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f1831bb40f21efbc253313009e334c69e9a7f7db6661bad4b698058c02226e61","category":"Tech"}
