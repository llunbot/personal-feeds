Designed to fold in half and pack down to take up less space inside or strapped onto your bikepacking bags, these shoes still manage to deliver off-the-beaten-path durability, with a proper Vibram sole and secure wrap-around bungee cord lacing…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PedalEd lightweight Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd lightweight Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes, photo by Sergio Villaba, camp shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_camp-shoes-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sergiovillalbastudio/\" target=\"_blank\">Sergio Villaba</a>/PEdALED)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best feelings after a long day pedaling on a multi-day bikepacking adventure, is slipping out of your cycling shoes and giving your feet a break. So, bikepackers often carry along a pair of light sandals for their time off-the-bike. I’ve personally been pretty happy with these from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/quoc-x-restrap-bikepacking-sandal/\" target=\"_blank\">Restrap+Quoc</a>. But packing space is limited and weight is always a concern, so more often than not, spare footwear is basic (<em>think</em>: flip-flops) and seldom well-suited for any extending walks beyond the immediate camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, PedalEd might just have a better solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd lightweight Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes, photo by Sergio Villaba, packable and space-saving\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_photo-by-Sergio-Villaba_folded-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A proper full-coverage shoe with a real lugged rubber sole… that still packs down super small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoes are a completely new category for the unique cycling clothing maker. But PedalEd can likely leverage some industry expertise from Fizik with whom they share their Selle Royal Group design HQ in Italy. They already do collaborate on occasional <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fizik-gtx-wet-weather-off-road-bike-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\">special</a> <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pedaled-jary-terra-gravel-shoes-take-fizik-powerstrap-tech-on-off-road-adventures/\" target=\"_blank\">edition</a> Fizik shoes. But these are totally different…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd light &amp; packable Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_pair-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most unique thing about the new shoes is their light fabric upper, which gives them a moccasin-like look and requires a zig-zag of bungee cord straps across the forefoot and around the back of your heel to keep them in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-packable-Vibram-One-Quarter-sole.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-packable-Vibram-One-Quarter-sole.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd light &amp; packable Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes, Vibram One Quarter folding sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-packable-Vibram-One-Quarter-sole.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-packable-Vibram-One-Quarter-sole-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-packable-Vibram-One-Quarter-sole-1536x614.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-packable-Vibram-One-Quarter-sole-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-packable-Vibram-One-Quarter-sole-768x307.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But functionally the most interesting feature is the proper Vibram rubber sole. It’s the same minimal One-Quarter sole that Vibram uses in their own packable slip-on shoes. The “special three-dimensional origami design” and LiteBase structure allow Vibram to make the sole 50% thinner without sacrificing performance or durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-and-packed-flat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-and-packed-flat.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd light &amp; packable Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes, packed pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-and-packed-flat.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-and-packed-flat-297x153.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-and-packed-flat-120x62.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_folded-and-packed-flat-768x395.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for how lightweight they are, we’ve asked PedalEd and will update when we know more… likely after the Italian summer holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd light &amp; packable Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes, top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_top-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>light foldable Ripstop uppers: 85% polyester, 10% polyurethane protective film + 5% plastic insert for structure</li>\n\n\n\n<li>lining is 100% polyester for breathability, with bamboo blended into the insole for better cooling</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vibram One-Quarter LiteBase 100% rubber GumLite Plus lugged outsole</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>PedalEd Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_side.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd light &amp; packable Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_side.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_side-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_side-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_side-768x432.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lightweight new PedalEd Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes sell for 135€ in just this one Grey Ink color.

Offering S, M, L &amp; XL, PedalEd says that each size can fit 4 standard whole EU shoe sizes thanks to the soft nature of how the soft shoe’s upper fabric folds, and the way the bungees cinch down. Overall fit range goes from a small EU 35 up to a big 49 (US men’s 3.5-14.5).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot.jpg\" alt=\"PedalEd lightweight Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes, photo by Sergio Villaba\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PedalEd-lightweight-Odyssey-Foldable-Bikepacking-Shoes_on-foot-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new PedalEd Bikepacking Shoes are technically available starting today, direct from PedalEd.com. But the M &amp; L sizes that would fit many adult cyclists, I think (EU 39-46) are already sold out. So you might find a pair in a local shop or other online retail, or you’ll just have to be patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://pedaled.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PedalEd.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pedaled-slip-on-space-saving-odyssey-foldable-bikepacking-shoes-for-camp-hikes/\">PEdALED Slip-On Space-Saving Odyssey Foldable Bikepacking Shoes for Camp Hikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"eb672e52d7d5196567b54af1a944570bebfb9a19977c586f3a373630717aca9b","category":"Cycling"}
