While it looks very much like a traditional saddle, the dimensions don’t lie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cabrillo comes in two versions, WCS and Comp. Both use Ritchey’s Vector Wing shell design, which isolates the rails from the top, creating a flex zone to suspend the rider without making the saddle squishy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"890\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1.jpg\" alt=\"ritchey cabrillo saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1-800x445.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ritchey-logic-cabrillo-saddle-1-1536x854.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cabrillo WCS gets a nylon &amp; carbon shell with stainless steel rails and lightweight polyurethane foam padding.

That’s 18mm shorter than their Streem saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top profile is flat from tip to tail, making it easier to slide fore/aft on the saddle over technical terrain, which makes it perfect for cyclocross. A slight curve from side to side mimics other popular short-and-wide designs to offer good sit bone support without hindering hip and leg movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unisex design has a slim center channel to reduce pressure on the perineal area. Available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ritcheylogic.com/bike/saddles/wcs-cabrillo-saddle\" target=\"_blank\">RitcheyLogic.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ritchey-cabrillo-road-gravel-saddle/\">Ritchey Cabrillo is Their First Short-Nosed Saddle</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"dce2dda987f5c7b97625f3bb58f15220306c121b8c99c085e45acb2e3ef910b9","category":"Cycling"}
