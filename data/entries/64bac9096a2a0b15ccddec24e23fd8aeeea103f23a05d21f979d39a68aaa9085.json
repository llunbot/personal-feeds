With almost 2 million votes, about 70 percent of users supported reinstating Jones, who was banned by Twitter in 2018.</p>\n<p>\"I vehemently disagree with what he said about Sandy Hook, but are we a platform that believes in freedom of speech or are we not? That is what it comes down to in the end. If the people vote him back on, this will be bad for X financially, but principles matter more than money,\" Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1733535277119918116?s=20\">wrote</a> on Saturday.
