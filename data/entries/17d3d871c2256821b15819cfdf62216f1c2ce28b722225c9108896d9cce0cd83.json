Apple has offered a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-iphone-ban/\">$1 billion</a> investment in the country that includes building an AirTag factory. The offer is a significant increase from its previous offers of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/\">$10 million</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/\">$100 million</a>, which were rejected by the government.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n“I strongly believe it will resolve very, very soon,” the country's investment minister Rosan Roeslani said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos on Tuesday. \"Hopefully within one or two weeks this issue can be resolved.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"The way they calculate it is different I think,\" he said, referring to the local content requirement. \"Now they find a solution on that one, so hopefully they accept the discrepancies so we can have the iPhone 16 sold in Indonesia.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIndonesia represents a significant market for Apple, with the country's population of 280 million operating some 354 million active mobile phones. The company has maintained developer academies there since 2018, but the country currently hosts no Apple manufacturing facilities. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/apple-deal-to-lift-iphone-16-ban-indonesia/\">Apple Reportedly Close to a Deal to Lift iPhone 16 Ban in Indonesia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-close-to-a-deal-to-lift-iphone-16-ban-in-indonesia.2447878/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17d3d871c2256821b15819cfdf62216f1c2ce28b722225c9108896d9cce0cd83","category":"Apple"}
