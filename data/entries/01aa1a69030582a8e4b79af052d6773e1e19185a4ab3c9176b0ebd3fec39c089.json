That would be unsurprising, as the M1 Ultra and M2 Ultra chips both have up to double the number of CPU and GPU cores compared to the M1 Max and M2 Max chips, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNot all patterns at Apple carry on forever, so it is still noteworthy that the M4 Ultra chip will likely follow the same doubling scheme as usual.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen will the M4 Ultra chip be available? In a report last month, Gurman said the next Mac Studio will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/m4-macbook-air-production-beginning-soon/\">likely \"debut between March and June\" next year</a>, and higher-end configurations of that computer should be available with the M4 Ultra chip. He expects a new Mac Pro desktop tower with the M4 Ultra chip to follow <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-studio-m4-mac-pro-2025/\">in the second half of next year</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the Mac Studio and Mac Pro were never updated with M3 series chips, the M4 Ultra chip would give these computers an improved Neural Engine for Apple Intelligence and ray tracing for improved graphics rendering for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA few years ago, Gurman said that Apple had tested a so-called \"M2 Extreme\" chip that would have offered even greater performance than the M2 Ultra chip, but he later said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/mac-pro-m2-extreme-chip-likely-scrapped/\">the chip's release was canceled</a>. Apple could choose to revisit an \"Extreme\" chip for the Mac Pro in the future, but there are no \"M4 Extreme\" chip rumors as of now.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/what-to-expect-from-m4-ultra-chip/\">What to Expect From Apple's M4 Ultra Chip Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-m4-ultra-chip-next-year.2441894/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01aa1a69030582a8e4b79af052d6773e1e19185a4ab3c9176b0ebd3fec39c089","category":"Apple"}
