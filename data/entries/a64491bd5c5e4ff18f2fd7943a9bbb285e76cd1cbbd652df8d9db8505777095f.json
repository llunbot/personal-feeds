Despite the very light 1,510g wheelset weight, these have no rider weight limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"hub closeup and rim profile for rolf prima ares 4 AR all-road wheels with pair spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-297x75.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-800x202.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-120x30.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-768x194.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-1536x387.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires3-2048x516.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new rims are 25mm wide internal, 31mm external, and 40mm deep. The hubs use taller flanges where they can for improved bracing angles, and get the same titanium freehub body as White’s CLD hubs. They’re available in standard road spacing with thru axles or QR, with ceramic bearing upgrades available.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires.jpg\"><img width=\"1370\" height=\"1027\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires.jpg\" alt=\"rolf prima ares 4 AR all-road wheels with pair spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires.jpg 1370w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rolf-prima-ares4-ar-all-road-tires-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to excel in everything from crits to gravel races, the Rolf Prima Ares4 AR wheels are meant to be your all-around, do anything drop bar wheelset with tires from 28mm up to 50mm wide.
