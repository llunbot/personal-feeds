He talks about how social media has impacted his life, why he posts what he does, and how he finds a balance among it all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also chats openly about the potential pressures of coming from a cycling family as well as the enjoyment he gets from riding super-long distances in often super remote places. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liam is the director of his own ride, the SSX Mystery Tour, a 270km Sussex adventure which he explains is based on the concept of riding rather than racing, and is aptly named so there can be a few curve balls thrown in. Gravel taste buds are sure to be tingled. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential for a <em>Cyclist </em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-worlds-what-to-watch\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle-ball </a>team also comes into the mix – watch out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Glasgow World Champs 2023</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview starts at 6:06.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>  </div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 85 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This episode is supported by H.V.M.N, the creators of Ketone-IQ.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We hear a lot about ketones in the pro peloton, but what are they?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>According to the experts at H.V.M.N, ketones are a natural source of fuel for your body. When stored carbs are depleted, your body starts to convert fat into ketones. Studies show that ketones are 28% more efficient than glucose, making them a super-efficient fuel source for the brain and the body.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These benefits led H.V.M.N to create Ketone-IQ: a drinkable ketone designed to support energy, focus and endurance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Developed alongside the U.S. military, Ketone-IQ is one of the most powerful ketone supplements on the market. It’s designed to elevate your ketone levels for up to 4 hours – much longer than other products. Plus, it’s vegan, caffeine free, and compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s guidelines. That’s a major win for athletes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ketone-IQ Shots are the best way to get your ketones on the go. They’re portable, convenient, and fit perfectly in your pocket during a ride or a race.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can save 20% on Ketone-IQ using the promo code CYCLIST at <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?\" target=\"_blank\">https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about achieving your ultimate metabolic potential, subscribe to H.V.M.N’s podcast ‘Health Via Modern Nutrition with Dr Latt Mansor’ on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube.
