But today you can save a bundle: Amazon is selling the 13-inch <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J776JL/?th=1\">M4 iPad Pro M4 with 512GB of storage for $1,300</a>, a savings of $200 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a fantastic price for this extremely thin and extremely powerful tablet. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">our review of the iPad Pro M4</a> concluded with a 5-star review and our expert appreciated that this tablet’s performance rivals that of the M3 MacBook Pro. “The new iPad Pro is the best tablet you can currently get. Its performance and range of functions are first-class, while the new OLED display saves on weight and makes a flatter chassis possible,” we wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 iPad Pro also excels when it comes to battery life. In our tests, the tablet managed to deliver 14 hours of video at full brightness or about 10 hours of surfing the web, both of which are spectacular and more than enough to get through days of use. You can also transform this tablet into a super portable laptop of sorts with the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-magic-keyboard-for-ipad-air-13-m2-black/6340385.p?skuId=6340385\">Magic Keyboard</a>, or you can use it as a drawing pad (or take notes) with the help of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J71RM7\">Apple Pencil Pro</a>, both excellent accessories that we highly recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our only real problem with the M4 iPad Pro is its best price, but this discount certainly helps. So if you’ve always wanted one, now’s the time to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J776JL/?th=1\">get the M4 iPad Pro for $1,300 from Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>The iPad Pro M4 is spectacular and $200 off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J776JL/?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dc094b4b8a72243d2b18f006bb8fb21cab48c75a71e858e1d4803465be1d89cd","category":"Apple"}
