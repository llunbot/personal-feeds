But Microsoft and Activision say they still see a path forward for their proposed merger, even if it's now a longer road than anticipated.</p>\n<h2>An unappealing appeals process</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/microsoft-xbox-chief-seeks-to-reassure-game-staff-on-activision\">Bloomberg reports</a> that in an all-hands meeting for the gaming division Thursday,Â Xbox chief Phil Spencer said Microsoft's interest in the deal \"hasn't wavered\" in the wake of the UK's decision. Spencer reportedly still sees a way forward for the deal despite acknowledging that the UK decision will \"slow the approval process.\"</p>\n<p>Though the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) release was <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/644939aa529eda000c3b0525/Microsoft_Activision_Final_Report_.pdf\">the regulator's final report</a> on the proposed merger, that doesn't necessarily represent the UK government's absolute final say on the deal. The CMA decision can be appealed to <a href=\"https://www.catribunal.org.uk\">the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal</a> (CAT), and both Microsoft and Activision instantly signaled their intent to do so in statements following the report's release on Wednesday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935332#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935332&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f9089512d286303e471c859cb0c266ef51d922a117803852a96f84a760b2395","category":"Tech"}
