The software on board did a credible job of recognizing nearby craters, even with elongated shadows over the terrain. However, the lander's altimeter had failed.</p>\n<p>So while <em>Athena</em> knew where it was relative to the surface of the Moon, the lander did not know how far it was above the surface.</p>\n<p>An important detail, that. As a result, the privately built spacecraft struck the lunar surface on a plateau, toppled over, and began to skid across the surface. As it did so, the lander rotated at least once or twice before coming to a stop in a small, shadowed crater.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/athena-landed-in-a-dark-crater-where-the-temperature-was-minus-280-f/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/athena-landed-in-a-dark-crater-where-the-temperature-was-minus-280-f/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af91de686e481aae69d24c76e50470d8a4b3cbb457c68dde56fbb4a24f99e9cd","category":"Tech"}
