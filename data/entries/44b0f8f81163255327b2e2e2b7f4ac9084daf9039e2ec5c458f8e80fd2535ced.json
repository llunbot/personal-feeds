I am also really interested in time-trialling, and leading up to the Zurich Worlds last year I put a lot of work into it and started to appreciate aerodynamics as an art. I want to see how far I can go with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When did you know you were pretty good?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I won both the road race and time-trial at the European Youth Olympics in Slovakia in 2022. It was the first time I’d raced abroad with girls who weren’t British, and my first time racing against 100 instead of 50. It made me realise that if I could be good at an under-16 level, then I could be competitive as a junior on the international stage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How has Yorkshire shaped you as a cyclist?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s taught me to never give up, to keep trying and to be really determined, and that creates a mental strength that ultimately leads to being more successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The culture of riding in Yorkshire is to look after yourself, to learn how to be independent. From a young age I was doing group rides and chaingangs and no one gave a shit if I was dropped. It’s the centre of cycling in the UK, and when the weather’s nice there’s nowhere better to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could choose, what would be your ideal parcours?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be in Yorkshire of course, and based around Grassington near Skipton. The area is used for chaingangs and ten-mile TTs, so many people know it. There are no flat roads in Yorkshire but this is one of the flatter stretches that still has some punchy climbs. I’d then have the race finishing with a small bunch sprint.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>What did you expect from your stagiaire stint with Movistar at the end of 2024?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I anticipated learning how to be more of a team player – as a junior you don’t sacrifice so much because you’re not paid to do it. So I was surprised when opportunities presented themselves to go for a win a couple of times, and I definitely did not expect to win. But the team believed in and supported me, and it reaffirmed why I joined Movistar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was it like winning two pro races so young?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really crazy. And to be honest, I don’t think I deserved to win. In the first race [Stage 1 of the Tour de la Semois], I was dropped four times and I wasn’t the one getting the group back to the front, so it was a big shock for me. And in the second race [Binche-Chimay-Binche] my teammate Emma Norsgaard was meant to attack in the last kilometre, but in the end I got the chance to sprint and won. I didn’t see it coming. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cat-ferguson-2-776x970.webp\" alt=\"Cat Ferguson\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cat-ferguson-2-776x970.webp 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cat-ferguson-2-240x300.webp 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cat-ferguson-2-768x960.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cat-ferguson-2-750x938.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cat-ferguson-2-1140x1425.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/cat-ferguson-2.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s your secret to nailing big races?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to be a really nervous bike rider and before races I wouldn’t be overly pleasant to be around; I’d be really quiet and not speak with people. I think the reason why I didn’t win the Worlds in my first year as a junior was because of nerves. But now I’ve learned that being nervous is just wasted energy – it’s not helpful and it’s detrimental to performance. I’ve since learned to enjoy the fact that I’m getting the privilege to race my bike and have learned ways to manage pressure and nerves to not let it become too big a thing.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-vuelta-femenina-2025-gallery\">The best photos from La Vuelta Femenina 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/anna-henderson-interview\">‘I really want to make my mark in one-day races’: Anna Henderson Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sarah-gigante-interview\">‘My dreams are bigger now’: Sarah Gigante Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cat-ferguson-interview\">‘I’m just excited to race my bike for a living’: Cat Ferguson interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Will you continue with cyclocross?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest cross season didn’t go how I wanted it to. I had challenges with injuries and not much luck with mechanicals. For me to commit to a cross season, it would take a lot away from the road, and I also know I’m lacking in areas and technically I’m not really that great. But I think I’ll definitely be back because I can’t leave cross forever the way I left it this winter. I’ll come back, fix things and resurrect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cyclocross is expected to be in the Winter Olympics in 2030 – would that be a goal?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a kid my biggest dream was going to the Olympics in any sport, so it’s a big motivator that cross is likely to be included. It would be really cool and amazing to potentially be at the first Winter Olympics for cyclists and then go to a summer Games as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your career goals?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Olympic gold in the road race is my ultimate goal in terms of a race to win – it’s incredibly hard to do but it’s a massive dream of mine. I’d also like to win the elite World Championships and the Tour of Flanders because it was my favourite junior race [she won it in 2023]. I’d love to do well in Roubaix as well but I’m not sure it’s really my style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your hopes for the rest of the 2025 season?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find my feet a little bit more in the bigger races and to be competitive in the smaller races if something presents itself. The Grand Tours will come later once I’ve got more physical attributes to be able to repeat efforts day after day. There’s no pressure on me, and the team is happy for me to come last if it means I’ve done my job for the other girls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are you most fearful of?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not improving year-on-year and plateauing. I had a really successful junior career and I would really love to be competitive at an elite level. I love training and I know that sometimes I do a little too much, so I have to manage that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which rider would you like to get advice from?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark Cavendish. His journey through the sport, all the ups and downs, is really incredible and I’d love to speak to him about it.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cat-ferguson-interview-2025\">‘Being nervous is just wasted energy’: Cat Ferguson Q&amp;A</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"44b0f8f81163255327b2e2e2b7f4ac9084daf9039e2ec5c458f8e80fd2535ced","category":"Cycling"}
