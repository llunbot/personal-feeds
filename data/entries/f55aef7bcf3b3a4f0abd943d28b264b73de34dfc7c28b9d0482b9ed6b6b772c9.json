It has also intensified scrutiny of investments by Chinese firms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to government documents seen by <em>Reuters</em>, a closed-door meeting was attended by representatives from Xiaomi, Samsung, Apple and Vivo to discuss the plan. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe government is said to be giving smartphone makers a year to comply with the rules when it comes into effect, but there are concerns that they could delay launch timeframes for new smartphones and lead to business losses. Currently it takes about 21 weeks for a smartphone and its parts to be tested by India's IT ministry for safety compliance.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/india-new-smartphone-security-rules/\">India to Crack Down on Pre-Installed Apps Under New Smartphone Security Rules</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/india-to-crack-down-on-pre-installed-apps-under-new-smartphone-security-rules.2383654/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f55aef7bcf3b3a4f0abd943d28b264b73de34dfc7c28b9d0482b9ed6b6b772c9","category":"Apple"}
