but as our Big Ride in Cyclist’s July issue details, the Monte Grappa is much more than just a cycling climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a region that still bears the scars of two World Wars, ascending to the summit of this iconic mountain is as much an exercise in bearing witness to its sombre history as it is a test of muscles and resolve on two wheels. Thankfully, unlike the pros on Saturday looking to deny Pogačar yet another stage win, we only had to go up once.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist issue 153, July 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/new-issue-153-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rob Milton</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s a distinctly Italian flavour to the other climb that features in our July issue too. The San Bernardino Pass may be on the other side of the Swiss border, yet its epic switchbacks and gloriously expansive views are a match for any climb on the Italian side. It’s a climb that rises almost 1,700m over 30km, but rewards you for your efforts the closer you get to its Alpine summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won’t find much climbing to speak of in Denmark, but what you will find in its capital city of Copenhagen is what is widely acknowledged as the best cycling infrastructure on the planet. We hit the streets to discover just what makes this ‘the world’s most bike-friendly city’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"
