Now, though, new research claims that locally run bots using specially trained image-recognition models can match human-level performance in this style of CAPTCHA, achieving a 100 percent success rate despite being decidedly not human.</p>\n<p>ETH Zurich PhD student Andreas Plesner and his colleagues' new research, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08831\">available as a pre-print paper</a>, focuses on Google's ReCAPTCHA v2, which challenges users to identify which street images in a grid contain items like bicycles, crosswalks, mountains, stairs, or traffic lights. Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/googles-recaptcha-announces-invisible-background-captchas/\">began phasing that system out years ago</a> in favor of an \"invisible\" reCAPTCHA v3 that analyzes user interactions rather than offering an explicit challenge.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the older reCAPTCHA v2 is <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/reCAPTCHA-v2\">still used by millions of websites</a>. And even sites that use the updated reCAPTCHA v3 will sometimes <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54215482/combining-recaptcha-v2-and-v3/63344009#63344009\">use reCAPTCHA v2 as a fallback</a> when the updated system gives a user a low \"human\" confidence rating.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053063#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053063&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51cde51db6d044e4cb8226a5c162a51572894b90e67945a7edf687b2d8dea1b7","category":"Tech"}
