The vehicles have also returned to Belgium to survey additional regions <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/03/apple-maps-vehicles-belgium-netherlands/\">after focusing on the Brussels area last year</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/apple-maps-vehicle-austria.jpeg\" /><div><em>Apple Maps vehicle in Vienna, Austria.

Introduced in iOS 13, Look Around is similar to Google's Street View, providing 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhere available, Look Around can be accessed by tapping the binoculars icon in the top-right corner of the Maps app. Look Around also appears in the search results for a supported city, below the Flyover and Directions buttons.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple Maps vehicles began surveying efforts in 2015, collecting data in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Croatia, Poland, Germany, Hungary, Singapore, Israel, and select other countries and territories. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn its website, Apple says it is committed to protecting the public's privacy while conducting surveys. For example, Apple blurs out faces and license plates in street-level imagery made available through Look Around.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps-vehicles/\">Apple Maps vehicles</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/apple-maps-vehicles-in-more-countries/\">Apple Maps Vehicles Collecting 'Look Around' Imagery in Several More Countries</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-vehicles-collecting-look-around-imagery-in-several-more-countries.2305540/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AzZcKK2ndV8:Q6HN2ZHz1w8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AzZcKK2ndV8:Q6HN2ZHz1w8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AzZcKK2ndV8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d6329b09517cbde08c36dd1acfd4ac1c03f90c854da8d546f62497a2136b0d47","category":"Apple"}
