We were able to activate a fresh Windows 11 Pro 22H2 install with a Windows 8 Pro product key as of this morning, as was Neowin. But Neowin could not activate a newer Insider Preview build of Windows, suggesting that the change will mostly affect newer Windows versions. We've asked Microsoft for clarification and will update this story if we receive any.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972170#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972170&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0fbcac132b7640067a332fc9292c7500ccc7b2142e758555e367f43cf68f3934","category":"Tech"}
