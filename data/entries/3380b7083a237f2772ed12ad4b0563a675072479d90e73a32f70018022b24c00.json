The wallpapers shown are said to be based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/iphone-15-colors/\">colorway rumors</a> for the iPhone 15 Pro models and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1696309927378407830?s=20\">hand-drawn image</a> allegedly leaked by an engineer in a Chinese iPhone factory. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, as happens every year, Apple fans have gone to work looking for clues in Apple's \"Wanderlust\" event invite, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">dropped on Tuesday</a>, with some suggesting the blue, silver, and gray tones allude to the colors that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be available in. There's also speculation that the matte particle-like texture is a nod to the texture of the devices' new titanium chassis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iphone-15-pro-box-rumor-colors.jpg\" alt width=\"800\" height=\"409\" /><div><em>Concept render representing alleged iPhone 15 Pro boxes</em></div>\r<br />\nThe two higher-end iPhone models this year will feature a titanium frame instead of a stainless steel frame, with a brushed titanium finish that will look different than the shiny stainless steel. Color options are said to include a titanium gray shade (similar to the Apple Watch Ultra), a blue gray color, a black shade, and a lighter silver shade.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/iphone-15-colors/\">Here Are All the iPhone 15 Colors We Expect From Apple</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple's tagline for the event is \"Wonderlust,\" a play on the word wanderlust, meaning \"a strong desire to travel,\" which could be a reference to the upgraded cameras on the Pro models, in particular the periscope telephoto lens expected to be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-15-pro-max-periscope-rumored-again/\">allowing for 5x or 6x optical zoom</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-2023-event.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /><div><em>The image accompanying Apple's official \"Wonderlust\" event invitation</em></div>\r<br />\nFor those unable to watch Apple's September 12 event, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage on MacRumors.com and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.
