Leaker <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@sonnydickson\">Sonny Dickson</a> has revealed a new image of dummy units that purportedly show off the new colors for the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models, due to be released next month. It makes the color choices maybe not exciting, but more interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As previously rumored, there will be a white, black, and grey model (or Natural Titanium perhaps), along with a new option to replace the Blue Titanium in the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. That new color has been rumored to be Desert Yellow in some leaks, and Rose or Rose Gold in others. We have to say, that last color looks decidedly <em>bronze</em> in this image. It’s practically brown. If this is Desert Yellow then it leans heavily on the “Desert” side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The black looks a lot better though, definitely a darker shade of black than the “dark gray” of the current Black Titanium shade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect Apple to introduce the iPhone 16 Pro at an event in September, likely on the second week of the month.
