This is a feature that Apple has offered for some time, but Messenger did not support it until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFacebook is also adding audio and video voice messages, mirroring a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> feature that Apple introduced with iOS 17. Messenger users can leave audio or voice messages when a Messenger call isn't picked up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMessenger now supports HD video calls, background noise suppression, and voice isolation for clearer call quality when using Messenger. HD is enabled by default for calls made on Wi-Fi, and it can be added for cellular calls as well in the Messenger settings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the near future, Messenger will support AI backgrounds in Messenger video calls. Creating a personalized AI background can be done by tapping on the effects icon in the sidebar of a video call and choosing the \"Backgrounds\" option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore information about the new Messenger announcements can be <a href=\"https://messengernews.fb.com/2024/11/20/introducing-ai-backgrounds-noise-suppression-and-more-for-messenger-calling/\">found on Facebook's website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook-messenger/\">Facebook Messenger</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/facebook-messenger-siri-integration/\">Facebook Messenger Gains Siri Integration, Audio and Video Voice Messages and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-messenger-gains-siri-integration-audio-and-video-voice-messages-and-more.2443594/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"da9589def5a3180dad21fda4fc8247f27405fd87df6fd99a79d4073360551e86","category":"Apple"}
