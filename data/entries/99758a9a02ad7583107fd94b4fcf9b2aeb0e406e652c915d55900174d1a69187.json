That being said, Apple has released new colors many more times than it has chosen not to do so since 2017, so a refresh is possible this year, but given Apple didn't do so last year, it's far from certain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has only ever added new \"Pro\" model color options once, in 2022, so while it's theoretically possible this year, it is perhaps more unlikely than likely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16‌ is available in Black, White, Teal, Pink, and Ultramarine. A new red, yellow, purple, or grey seem possible since these have all been offered on ‌iPhone‌ models in the past and are not too similar to any of the existing shades. There are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">usually rumors</a> that point to which new color to expect, but it may still be a little too early for this based on previous years.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/new-iphone-16-colors-this-year/\">Will Apple Release New iPhone 16 Colors This Year?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-release-new-iphone-16-colors-this-year.2449136/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"99758a9a02ad7583107fd94b4fcf9b2aeb0e406e652c915d55900174d1a69187","category":"Apple"}
