Cops would seemingly need to subscribe to each account to monitor the entire platform, one expert who aids in police CSAM investigations, Trey Amick, suggested to Reuters.</p>\n<p>OnlyFans claims that the amount of CSAM on its platform is extremely low. Out of 3.2 million accounts sharing \"hundreds of millions of posts,\" OnlyFans only removed 347 posts as suspected CSAM in 2023. Each post was voluntarily reported to the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which OnlyFans told Reuters has \"full access\" to monitor content on the platform.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035127#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035127&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"39b2c0f98773095f892ded60b508e06e277cfe914d0afe3c1c4af36f872476fd","category":"Tech"}
