The speaker received a few updates in its first several years on the market, with the final revision being a redesigned Beats Pill+ with a Lightning charging port, introduced under Apple's ownership in 2015. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/\">discontinued the Beats Pill+ in early 2022</a>, but a new version now appears to be on the horizon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/beats-pill-f1-daniel-ricciardo.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><em>The new Beats Pill speaker</em></div>\r<br />\nThe new Beats Pill is likely to feature a USB-C charging port, upgraded Bluetooth, and more. Leaked images revealed a built-in lanyard, which was not available on previous models, along with red, black, and gold color options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeats is releasing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/\">new Solo Buds earbuds</a> in June, so perhaps the new Beats Pill will launch next month too, but Apple has yet to formally announce the speaker. The previous Beats Pill+ was originally priced at $229.95 in the U.S. when it launched in 2015, but it had been available for $179.95 prior to being discontinued.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>The listing on Apple's regulatory website was spotted by MacRumors contributor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/\">Aaron Perris</a>.</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/new-beats-pill-speaker-on-apple-regulatory-website/\">New Beats Pill Speaker Listed on Apple's Regulatory Website as Launch Approaches</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-beats-pill-speaker-listed-on-apples-regulatory-website-as-launch-approaches.2427568/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"beaf98a4a1eab0a1457cb8545fff463a1dad3a3f99e2edda9b488156747f3954","category":"Apple"}
