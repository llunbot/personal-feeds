Yet a touch of wheels caused General Classification leader Rein Taaramäe to hit the ground.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Estonian, the golden three-kilometre mark had been and passed, meaning most damage was ultimately done to his pride as opposed to his time advantage.</p>\n<p>Up ahead, a hotly contested sprint finish was forming. High speeds, jostling bikes and jumping positions indicated a free-for-all was on the cards. They were dealt in favour of <a href=\"/tags/deceuninck-quickstep\">Deceuninck-QuickStep</a>’s sprinter, who weaved between EF Education-Nippo’s Magnus Cort and <a href=\"/tags/groupama-fdj\">Groupama-FDJ</a>’s Arnaud Démare to surge ahead of his competitors at the finish in Molina de Aragón.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10017/flanders-uci-road-cycling-world-championships-2021-key-information\">Flanders UCI Road Cycling World Championships 2021: Key information</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nSpeaking afterwards, the 24-year-old said: 'It’s a dream come true. After the crash, I was a long way back, but I’m happy I’m here.</p>\n<p>'A lot of time and effort has gone into this by a lot of people, and it’s also their victory. I’m talking about all the doctors and surgeons and medical staff in Poland, through to my second family here with the team, and everything in between. It’s also their victory. It’s also my family’s victory, because they’re the reason I’m here.'</p>\n<p>His fairy-tale moment stands tall in a year that has witnessed several similarly impressive comeback stories, Mark Cavendish being one of the most prevalent.</p>\n<p>Sometimes cycling can bestow its best moments onto those it previously hurt the most. Jakobsen’s victory was not only the result of his team ensuring his safety throughout the day, but further the culmination of an extensive rehabilitation programme supported by his family and team; his green points jersey now the physical representation of all he has worked through to get back to this point in his career.</p>\n<p>Below, Chris Auld's images of the day:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9994/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-4-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 19</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage4-1.jpg?itok=h8mr7FE6\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>19</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9994/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-4-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 4 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>18 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9994%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-4-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%204%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9994%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-4-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%204%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9994%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-4-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%204%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9994%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-4-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9994/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-4-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 19</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage4-1.jpg?itok=h8mr7FE6\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"17f3aead17d4bd2b4b449b360fe85f2f8f589241c58b5d804e9ef52ba4e911f7","category":"Cycling"}
