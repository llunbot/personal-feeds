Well, it really ought to be, but as a component that’s relatively cheap and easy to produce, practically every manufacturer involved in cycling has had a go at it, and most experienced cyclists will have found some bike bottle holders are simply better than others.</p>\n<p>Like any other component, bottle cages also come in a variety of different materials – from plastic and aluminium, which tend to be the cheapest, to carbon and titanium, which are inevitably more expensive.</p>\n<p>Performance often depends more on the style and construction of the cage, rather than the material it’s made of though, so don’t assume a carbon bottle cage is better just because it costs more.</p>\n<p>While some people swear by innovative solutions involving various types of magnets or studs, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bottle-cages-are-perfect/\">most people just want something simple that works with standard cycling bottles</a>, and holds on to them securely over even the roughest terrain.</p>\n<p>We’ve put together a list of our favourite bike bottle holders on the market in 2023, and included a variety of different styles and price points, so everyone should be able to find something to suit their budget.</p>\n<h2>The best bottle cages in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Arundel Mandible DTR</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Mandible’s svelte design is far tougher than it looks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £65/$75/AU$120</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 22g</li>\n</ul><p>Arundel’s 22g Mandible DTR stands for ‘down tube right’: its recommended position and access side.

Generous bolt slots ease fitting and the cage has great strength, while weighing only 38g.</p>\n<p>The design’s retaining arms wrap around the bottle high up and continue separately until joining in a Y-shape at the base.</p>\n<p>This permits flex that helps easy bottle insertion while providing security. The cage’s engagement lip works best with Fabric and Specialized bottles, but holds everything well.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Lezyne Flow</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The sturdy build means it’s not that light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price: </strong>£12.99</li>\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>48.7g</li>\n</ul><p>An X-Grip design works well on bumpy roads, holding onto bottles with a tenacious grip, though the design means bottles must be pushed directly down into the cage.</p>\n<p>The bolt holes have 10mm of adjustability, allowing the cage to be manoeuvred around frame bags.</p>\n<p>The cage features a smooth, slick finish, as is expected on cages at this price point.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>LifeLine Essential</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> LifeLine’s Essential offers good value.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudrey / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £5/$10/AU$15</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 40g</li>\n</ul><p>Wiggle’s cycling bits-and-bobs brand LifeLine has come up with this elegant, bright design.</p>\n<p>The Essential is made from tough polycarbonate plastic and comes in four glossy colours: black, blue, red and white.</p>\n<p>It does what you need it to, keeping your bottle secure even over rough and cobbled roads, and represents very good value.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Topeak Ninja Master+ X1</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> At 49.7g including levers, this cage isn’t as light as some, but it’s a great price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £9.99</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 49.7g</li>\n</ul><p>Topeak’s Ninja Master+ X1 features two tyre levers that lock into the cage.
