The release dates of major macOS updates in recent years are listed below:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n  <li>OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) – October 22, 2013</li>\r<br />\n  <li>OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) – October 16, 2014</li>\r<br />\n  <li>OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) – September 30, 2015</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 10.12 (Sierra) – September 20, 2016</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) – September 25, 2017</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 10.14 (Mojave) – September 24, 2018</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 10.15 (Catalina) – October 7, 2019</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) – November 12, 2020</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 12.0 (Monterey) – October 25, 2021</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 13.0 (Ventura) – October 24, 2022</li>\r<br />\n  <li>macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) – September 26, 2023</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe release of ‌macOS Sequoia‌ by mid-September this year would be the earliest since OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), which was released on July 25, 2012.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new annual version of iOS has historically always been released at least a week before the new version of macOS. Sometimes, Apple leaves a considerable gap between the releases; in 2020, the company left nearly two months between the release of iOS 14 (September 16, 2020) and macOS Big Sur (November 12, 2020).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew major versions of iOS are always released before the launch of a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup in September. This year, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to launch on Friday, September 20. As a result, ‌macOS Sequoia‌ could not only be the earliest macOS release in over a decade, but also the first simultaneous iOS/macOS release ever, or even the first time a new version of macOS has been released before the new version of iOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is almost certain to share more information about the release of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ at its event on Monday, September 9, where it is also set to unveil the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup, new Apple Watch models, and the fourth-generation AirPods.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/08/macos-sequoia-earliest-release-in-years/\">macOS Sequoia Release Likely to Be the Earliest in Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-release-likely-to-be-the-earliest-in-years.2435348/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88722b77999f7bcfc0b137557d36a7cb503f5ed1e026cbe49d865299f1877d2d","category":"Apple"}
