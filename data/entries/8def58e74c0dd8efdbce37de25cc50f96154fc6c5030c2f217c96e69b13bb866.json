Aside from apparent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-chip-benchmarks/\">faster speeds</a>, RAM and port improvements, and the Space Black color option potentially trickling down to the base M4 version of the machine, it appears the machine <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/macbook-pro-m4-two-external-displays/\">may also support two external displays</a> in addition to the internal display for the first time on a base M-series chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Gurman: Apple to Launch First M4 Macs and Potentially iPad Mini 7 on November 1</h2>\r<br />\nSo when can we expect that M4 MacBook Pro and other new hardware to launch? <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says at least some of the rumored products are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/\">scheduled to launch on Friday, November 1</a>, potentially following an introduction earlier that week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-Real-Feature-Red.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn addition to a full range of 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models variously configured with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, we're also expecting a redesigned Mac mini with M4 and M4 Pro chip options, an M4 iMac, and a seventh-generation iPad mini, though it's not confirmed if all of these will be available simultaneously on November 1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Watch Users Report Vitals App Detecting Illness Before Symptoms Appear</h2>\r<br />\nThere's a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-watch-vitals-detects-illness-before-symptoms/\">new Vitals app in watchOS 11 that is impressing some users</a> with its ability to potentially detect illnesses up to several days before noticeable symptoms appear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-vitals.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe Vitals app brings together a number of key health metrics that are measured during sleep, and it can notify when one or more of these readings are outliers compared to your typical ranges, which can be a sign that you are getting sick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt won't pick up every illness and it's not able to diagnose or help treat any specific illnesses, but it appears it may be able to provide a bit of warning in some cases to help users be more aware of changes in their health.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 18: Send Messages Without a Wi-Fi or Cellular Connection</h2>\r<br />\nWith a pair of major hurricanes striking the southeastern United States in recent weeks, taking down power lines and cell service, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/send-messages-without-wi-fi-cellular-iphone/\">new iOS 18 feature is gaining particular notice: Messages via satellite</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-via-Satellite.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWhile iPhone 14 and newer models have already been able to take advantage of Emergency SOS and roadside assistance via satellite, iOS 18 expands those satellite capabilities to include standard iMessages and SMS texts, offering a way to get in touch with friends and family even when traditional networks are unavailable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Says Final iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle Models Are Now Obsolete</h2>\r<br />\nApple discontinued the final iPod nano and iPod shuffle models way back in 2017, and that means <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/obsolete-ipods/\">Apple now considers them obsolete</a> and thus ineglible for repairs at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/ipod_nano_2015_feature.jpg\" width=\"1552\" height=\"873\" />\r<br />\nBoth the iPod shuffle and the iPod nano were introduced in 2005 as smaller, cheaper music players in Apple's iPod lineup, and they both saw significant form factor evolutions over their lifespans with the final models debuting in mid-2015 before being discontinued two years later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/oct-10-2024\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/12/top-stories-ios-18-1-release-date/\">Top Stories: iOS 18.1 Release Date, New Macs Incoming, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-18-1-release-date-new-macs-incoming-and-more.2439878/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8def58e74c0dd8efdbce37de25cc50f96154fc6c5030c2f217c96e69b13bb866","category":"Apple"}
