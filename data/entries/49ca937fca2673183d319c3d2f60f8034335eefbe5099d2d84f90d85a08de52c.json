But the company's largest announcement, by volume, is about laptop processors.</p>\n<p>Today the company is expanding the Ryzen AI 300 lineup with a batch of updated high-end chips with up to 16 CPU cores and some midrange options for cheaper Copilot+ PCs. AMD has repackaged some of its high-end desktop chips for gaming laptops, including the first Ryzen laptop CPU with 3D V-Cache enabled. And there's also a new-in-name-only Ryzen 200 series, another repackaging of familiar silicon to address lower-budget laptops.</p>\n<h2>Ryzen AI 300 is back, along with high-end Max and Max+ versions</h2>\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2.jpeg 1920w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-384x216.jpeg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-1152x648.jpeg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-980x551.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ryzen-2025-04-2-1440x810.jpeg 1440w\" />\n      Ryzen AI is back, with Max and Max+ versions that include huge integrated GPUs.\n        Credit:\n          AMD\n      \n<p>We came away largely impressed by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/\">the initial Ryzen AI 300 processors</a> in August 2024, and new processors being announced today expand the lineup upward and downward.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amds-2025-ryzen-laptop-lineup-a-mix-of-powerful-new-and-renamed-old/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amds-2025-ryzen-laptop-lineup-a-mix-of-powerful-new-and-renamed-old/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"49ca937fca2673183d319c3d2f60f8034335eefbe5099d2d84f90d85a08de52c","category":"Tech"}
