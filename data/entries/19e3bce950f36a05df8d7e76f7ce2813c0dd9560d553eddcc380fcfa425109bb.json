The new computer is even smaller than before, features the M4 or M4 Pro chip, and starts with 16GB of unified memory. It still starts at $599 but Apple has doubled the RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>These are four standard configurations of the Mac mini Apple is offering:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$599/£599: M4 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB Unified Memory, and 256GB SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$799/£799: M4 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB Unified Memory, and 512GB SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$999/£999: M4 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 24GB Unified Memory, and 256GB SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,399/£1,399: M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB Unified Memory, and 256GB SSD</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 Mac mini: New design and ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has reduced the size of the Mac mini; it now measures 5 by 5 by 2 inches (12.7 by 12.7 by 5 centimeters), down from the previous 7.75 by 7.75 by 1.41 inches (19.7 by 19.7 by 3.6 centimeters), but not as small as the Apple TV, which measures 3.6 inches.

On the back are three Thunderbolt ports–the M4 Mac mini uses Thunderbolt 4, while the M4 Pro Mac mini has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2064049/intel-thunderbolt-5-bandwidth-speeds.html\">Thunderbolt 5</a>, the first Mac to support the technology. The back of all Mac mini also has an HDMI port and a gigabit ethernet port that is upgradeable to 10Gb ethernet for $100/£100. No USB-A ports are available, which means that you’ll need USB-C adapters for your older devices.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac mini 2024\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mini-2024.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The M4 Mac mini uses Thunderbolt 4 for its rear ports, while the M4 Pro model has Thunderbolt 5.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 and M4 Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Intel Core i7 Mac mini (released in 2018), Apple claims that the M4 offers 13.3 times faster gaming performance in <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>, 33 times faster image upscaling performance in Photomator, and “applies up to 2.8x more audio effect plugins in a Logic Pro project.” Compared to the M1 Mac mini (released in 2020), Apple states that the M4 is 4.9 times faster when merging panoramic images in Adobe Lightroom Classic, 1.7 times faster with spreadsheet calculations in Microsoft Excel, and 2 times faster when transcibing with on-device AI speech-to-text in MacWhisper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 Pro makes its debut with the Mac mini; the standard configuration has a 12-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, but it can be upgraded to a 14-core CPU and a 20-core GPU for $200/£200.
