Nobody knows, because there’s never been another product quite like it. But the plumpest golden goose in history isn’t going to keep laying eggs forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple, to its credit, is fully aware of this. With its enthusiastic hyping of the latest cautious iPhone update, the company might occasionally sound faintly deluded: a little like the man in the old joke who falls out of a building and says to the people on each floor as he passes, “Everything’s fine so far!” But Apple is doing its best to find a cushion to land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the company’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2594123/apple-posts-best-quarter-ever-despite-dip-in-iphone-china-sales.html\">latest financial results</a>, we got an idea of how the cushion hunt is going, and the answer is “pretty well.” Tim Cook named Q1 2025 as Apple’s best quarter ever, with record revenue of $124.3 billion despite a small year-on-year dip in the iPhone’s fortunes. Who needs the iPhone when you have consistent growth in services to make up for any shortfalls?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s certainly gratifying for the company to record its highest-ever quarterly revenue after launching one of its most boring iPhones (which <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2411341/apple-intelligence-ios-18-development-delayed-october.html\">didn’t even have its flagship feature</a> at launch). But there are concerns we should discuss before we break out the champagne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that regardless of growth in other areas, the iPhone remains Apple’s most important product by an unhealthy margin. That burgeoning Services division, a portmanteau category combining various tenuously related revenue streams, brought in a total of $26.3 billion, compared to the iPhone’s $69.1 billion. Wearables, Home, and Accessories brought in a combined $11.7 billion, the iPad just $8.1 billion, and Macs $7.8 billion. In first place, there’s the iPhone. In second place is daylight. And only then do we get to the other products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that light, it becomes a little clearer that simply growing services isn’t the straightforward solution to the iPhone’s eventual decline that it might sound like. This quarter, solid growth in services and iPads was just about enough to make up for a <em>tiny</em> drop for the iPhone. We’re still at a point where if the iPhone sneezes, Apple catches a cold. This wasn’t a sneeze. It was barely the first “Aaahh…”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, the iPhone will suffer a real setback, and we don’t yet know how Apple will handle that. Last week, research found that buyers of premium iPhones are becoming <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2593366/study-fewer-iphone-users-are-springing-for-storage-upgrades.html\">less inclined</a> to pay extra for more storage, which could become a headache if it turns into a long-term trend. Apple has historically made a <em>lot</em> of money from iPhone storage upgrades, but with the rise of music streaming and cloud photo storage, there doesn’t seem to be quite the same demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a company of Apple’s size, it isn’t easy to pivot, and it should be applauded for trying its best to do so. By building a mixed-reality headset and an AI platform Apple has positioned itself for two possible post-smartphone futures, and by growing Apple TV+ and its other subscription services it has shored up revenues in the short to medium term. These are all positive steps. But the pivot hasn’t yet been tested. Dip or not, this was another epic quarter from the iPhone, and we don’t yet know what will happen when the good times finally come to an end.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.
