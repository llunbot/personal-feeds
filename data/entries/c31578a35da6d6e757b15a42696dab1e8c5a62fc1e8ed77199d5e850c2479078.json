The court decided that Google has an illegal monopoly on search, and the judge overseeing the case is now deciding on the punishment (or remedies) that Google will face as a result.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe DoJ pointed to OpenAI as company that's growth has been hampered by Google's hold on search. Last year, OpenAI asked Google for access to search data to bolster SearchGPT, but Google refused.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with potentially being forced to sell Chrome, Google could be forced to allow rivals to access its search data. Turley said that access to Google's real-time data would allow OpenAI to \"build a better product faster.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle is also likely to be prohibited from entering into search related deals with Apple and other companies. Google has long paid Apple billions of dollars per year to be the default Safari search engine, giving Google a significant advantage in the search market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe DoJ is also recommending that Google divest Android, but only if the other proposed remedies are not effective at keeping Google from \"improperly leveraging\" the operating system, or if Google tries to circumvent the other requirements put in place.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring his testimony, Turley also said that OpenAI offered to pay Apple a portion of the revenue generated by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> ChatGPT integration, but it is not clear if Apple has accepted payment, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/apple-not-paying-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/\">prior reports suggested</a> that it was a deal that does not see Apple paying OpenAI, or OpenAI paying Apple.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/openai-google-chrome/\">OpenAI Wants to Buy Google's Chrome Browser</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-wants-to-buy-googles-chrome-browser.2455779/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c31578a35da6d6e757b15a42696dab1e8c5a62fc1e8ed77199d5e850c2479078","category":"Apple"}
