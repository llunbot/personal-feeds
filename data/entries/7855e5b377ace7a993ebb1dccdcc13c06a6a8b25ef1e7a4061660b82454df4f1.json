What they couldn’t tell us then was that there was a plan, and a new owner was about to come along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the brand is back in business, with long-time fan of the brand John Harrison as the new owner and CEO. Founder Bob Parlee will focus on design and engineering, and they say they were able to keep almost their entire team through this process and everyone’s reinvigorated and excited for the next phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I interviewed Harrison for our podcast to hear all about it, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-089-how-parlee-cycles-rebooted/\">listen to that episode here</a>, and check the official press release below.

The acquisition of the brand and 100% of the assets of Parlee Cycles signals the end of their Chapter 11 restructuring and ensures the longevity of the renowned brand. The business will operate under a newly formed entity named Parlee Composites, Inc., with John Harrison assuming the role of President and CEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob Parlee, the founder of Parlee Cycles, is broadly considered one of the leading designers and original masterminds of the carbon fiber bike industry.

Bob will remain on the executive team as Chief Designer and will turn 100% of his attention to the design and development of future models. John, as CEO will focus on the development of operational excellence in the business and the expansion of sales and marketing efforts.
