There's a new company out there peddling clothing evoking memories of old tech. Loewe, a Spanish fashion company that apparently makes <em>really </em>expensive clothing, is paying homage to pixelated graphics <em>à la Minecraft</em> with a recently released line of clothing that makes you look like you plucked clothing out of a retro game and slapped it on your 3D body.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/full-outfit-scaled-e1681239550381.jpg\"><img alt=\"2D meets 3D.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/full-outfit-scaled-e1681239550381-640x1758.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/full-outfit-1280x1955.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/full-outfit-scaled-e1681239550381.jpg\">2D meets 3D.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.loewe.com/\">Loewe</a>)</p></div>\n<p>If you're a retro gamer (and especially if you're the type of retro gamer who uses a modern TV), you may deal with pixelated graphics frequently. The low-resolution look is so popular that <em>Minecraft </em>and other modern titles swear by it today. And now Loewe is expecting people to pay thousands to dress like their part of a retro reality.</p>\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/11/23678711/loewe-pixelated-fashion-minecraft-paris-fashion-week-for-sale\">The Verge</a>, Loewe previewed the <a href=\"https://www.loewe.com/usa/en/stories-collection/pixel-perfect.html?utm_source=Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_medium=Affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=LOEWE_Paulas_Ibiza_22&amp;ranMID=47194&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-xLHsNNRu_wUQxF5Bh4APWQ\">Pixel collection</a> at Paris Fashion Week in October.
