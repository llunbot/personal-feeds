Reliable sources that include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/11/iphone-15-ditch-lightning-for-usb-c/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/13/usb-c-iphone-2023/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, and others, have said that Apple is going to make the change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe switch will allow Apple to comply with new regulations implemented in the European Union. These regulations require Apple to produce iPhones with USB-C ports in EU, so Apple had to either make a worldwide design swap or develop special iPhones for sale in the EU.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iphone-15-series-usb-c.jpeg\" alt width=\"984\" height=\"1012\" />\r<br />\nThe iPhone 15 Pro models with USB-C ports are expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/\">support higher-speed data transfers</a>, while the standard iPhone 15 models will continue to feature USB 2.0 speeds – the same as Lightning – giving the Pro models an edge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLeaker ShrimpApplePro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/\">has said</a> that iPhone 15 models will only officially support USB-C accessories certified by the Apple Made for iPhone (MFi) program. Apple supplier Foxconn is allegedly producing accessories like EarPods and cables with USB-C connectors that are MFi certified.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe MFi USB-C certification could be used to limit features like fast charging and high-speed data transfers to Apple-approved accessories. ShrimpApplePro says that cables with no MFi certification will be limited in data and charging speed. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also suggested that Apple will require Made for iPhone certification for USB-C chargers that are able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/\">fast charge the iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's annual iPhone event is expected to take place on either Tuesday, September 12, or Wednesday, September 13, this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/06/iphone-15-event-september-12-or-13/\">according to Gurman</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/\">USB-C iPhone</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/iphone-15-usb-c-parts-leak/\">Images of Alleged iPhone 15 USB-C Connector Parts Leak Online</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/images-of-alleged-iphone-15-usb-c-connector-parts-leak-online.2398049/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ff1a5972a93b8e422d0642fa82d80f1b1eb380ecad232cda607d40f20302da5c","category":"Apple"}
