The big news is that the Pixel a series is still $499 despite some upgrades.</p>\n<p>What are those upgrades? How about a 120 Hz display on Google's mid-ranger for the first time? The 6.1-inch, 120 Hz, 2400Ã—1080 display is closer to a flagship than ever, even if it is a smaller phone. You also get flagship-class support with Google's industry-leading seven years of OS updates, so the phone should be good until 2031, if you can hold out that long. Together, these two upgrades make the Pixel 8a an incredible value.</p>\n<p>Major news with last year's launch of the Pixel 7a was the older Pixel 6a, which got a big price drop down to $349 when the 7a came out. When asked about a potential Pixel 7a price drop, Google says it \"will continue to sell the Pixel 7a\" but also that it has \"<span><span>no</span> <span>news</span> to announce today on a pricing change.\"</span> It did feel like the Pixel 6a's price drop <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/pixel-7a-review-more-of-googles-winning-formula/\">stole some</a> of the 7a's thunder last year, so maybe Google is giving that announcement some breathing room. <span>For now, you'll have to think long and hard at checkout and decide between a</span> $499 Pixel 8a and a $499 Pixel 7a. The base model Pixel 8, at $699 with nearly the same specs, is also a tough sell in the face of the Pixel 8a.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022244#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd162cebf050d502cf794b3a99ecd085e7b014ce7f4c11274c33afa80e2ec8a4","category":"Tech"}
