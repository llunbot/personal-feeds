Choose that menu item (or type Command-Shift-G) and you can leap around the macOS filesystem without having to navigate folders. This is frequently useful when you’re working with low-level settings files or items hidden away in the user or system Library folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple made a significant change between macOS 11 Big Sur and 12 Monterey in how it helps you find folders: Monterey offers a squishier set of matching options, making it more likely you’ll find a folder that you don’t know the precise name of, or if you type fewer characters to make a match.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mac911-big-sur-go-to-folder-autocomplet.png\" /><figcaption>Big Sur limits matches to exact autocompletions.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mac911-monterey-go-to-folder-matches-bordered.png\" /><figcaption>Monterey provides matches, not just autocompletion, in declining order of exactness to what you typed.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In Big Sur, start to type a path and macOS will offer only auto-fill suggestions. In Monterey, however, it offers exact matches, but also fuzzier ones. Type in <code>~/.ss</code>, and macOS suggests <em>Users &gt; gif &gt; .ssh</em>, the path to the .ssh folder in my user folder. But it also matches <code>.dvdcss</code>, which has two s’s in a row, and then suggests even looser potentials, like <code>.zsh_history</code> and <code>.keybase-installer</code>. As you go down the list, matches become even more tangentially related to what you typed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
