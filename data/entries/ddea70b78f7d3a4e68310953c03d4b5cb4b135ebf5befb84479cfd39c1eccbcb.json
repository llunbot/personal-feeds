That means that the person has tested positive at the state level while confirmatory testing is being carried out at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>The presumptive positive worker was at a poultry facility in the state's northeastern Weld County. In recent weeks, six workers at another poultry farm in Weld also tested positive for bird flu. In that facility, a commercial egg layer operation with about 1.8 million birds, workers were infected as they culled chickens known to be infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza. Genetic testing of the virus in the birds and the workers indicated that they were infected with a strain of H5N1 closely related to the virus found spreading in dairy cattle and to dairy farm workers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038535#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038535&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ddea70b78f7d3a4e68310953c03d4b5cb4b135ebf5befb84479cfd39c1eccbcb","category":"Tech"}
