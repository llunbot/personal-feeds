That ended a few years of a bifurcated approach, where the Intel and AMD versions of Surface PCs were the \"main\" versions and the Arm variants felt more like proof-of-concept side projects.</p>\n<p>But if you work in a large organization or you're an IT administrator, the bifurcated approach continues.
