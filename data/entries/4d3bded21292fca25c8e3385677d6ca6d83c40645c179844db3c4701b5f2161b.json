But Colossal Order is not a typical developer. And <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> has not had anything close to a typical release.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oULuIc9BkgE\">\"Winter Recap\" video</a> up today for <em><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.4.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D1991684%26action%3Dedit&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F949230%2FCities_Skylines_II%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=6a6d3f69828df8557a5bb2f6093e25e3&amp;xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D\">Cities: Skylines 2</a> (C:S2)</em>, CEO Mariina Hallikainen says that her company's goal was to prevent the main issue they had with the original <em>Cities: Skylines</em>: continuing work on a game that was \"not a technical masterpiece\" for 10 years or more. The goal with <em>C:S2</em> was to use the very latest technology and build everything new.</p>\n<p>\"We are trying to make a city-building game that will last for a decade,\" Hallikainen says in the video. \"People didn't understand; we aren't using anything from <em>Cities: Skylines. </em>We're actually building everything new.\" Henri Haimakainen, game designer, says Colossal Order is \"like fighting against ourselves, in a way. We are our own worst competition,\" in trying to deliver not only the original game, but more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991684#p3\">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991684&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d3bded21292fca25c8e3385677d6ca6d83c40645c179844db3c4701b5f2161b","category":"Tech"}
