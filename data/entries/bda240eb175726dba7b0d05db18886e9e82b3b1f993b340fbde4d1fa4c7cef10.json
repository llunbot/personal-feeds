The exploit enables anyone to perform both username enumeration and password brute-forcing on vulnerable Azure servers. Although Microsoft had initially called the Autologon mechanism a \"design\" choice, it appears, the company is now working on a solution.</p>\n<h2>PoC script released on GitHub</h2>\n\n<p>Yesterday, a \"password spraying\" PoC exploit was published for the Azure Active Directory brute-forcing flaw on <a href=\"https://github.com/treebuilder/aad-sso-enum-brute-spray/tree/14b2bb72fd1238552c417e22f9e799b07d33fc35\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. The PowerShell script, just a little over 100 lines of code, is heavily based on <a href=\"https://github.com/Gerenios/AADInternals/blob/eade775c6cd4f8ed16bd77602e1ea12a02fe265e/KillChain_utils.ps1#L151\" target=\"_blank\">previous work</a> by Dr. Nestori Syynimaa, senior principal security researcher at Secureworks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>POC just popped for the SSO spray <a href=\"https://t.co/Ly2AHsR8Mr\">https://t.co/Ly2AHsR8Mr</a></p>\n<p>— rvrsh3ll (@424f424f) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/424f424f/status/1443199430639996932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit (CTU), exploiting the flaw, as in confirming users' passwords via brute-forcing, is quite easy, as demonstrated by the PoC. But, organizations that use Conditional Access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) may benefit from blocking access to services via username/password authentication. \"So, even when the threat actor is able to get [a] user's password, they may not be [able to] use it to access the organisation's data,\" Syynimaa told Ars in an email interview.<u></u></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799435#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799435&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ax Sharma","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bda240eb175726dba7b0d05db18886e9e82b3b1f993b340fbde4d1fa4c7cef10","category":"Tech"}
