It's a new privacy feature that's designed to allow users to see how often apps have accessed their sensitive info like location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts across the last seven days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/app-privacy-report-ios-15-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's also set up to show which apps have contacted other domains and how recently they've contacted them so you can keep an eye on what apps are doing behind the scenes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApp Privacy Report is available by opening up the Settings app, selecting the Privacy section, and choosing App Privacy Report. From there, you can toggle it on. After you use apps for some time, data will begin showing up in this spot.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Emergency SOS</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAuto Call, the feature that lets call emergency services with a series of button presses, has been updated in iOS 15.2. You can now press the side button rapidly multiple times to initiate, or hold down the side button and the volume button together.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/emergency-sos-ios-15-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's now a longer eight-second countdown before a call is placed, which is up from the prior three-second countdown.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Notification Summary</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAs <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/qh3yn9/ios_152_db1_new_scheduled_summary_ui/\">noted on Reddit</a>, Notification Summary has a new look with more of a card-style view that makes it easier to see at a glance what's included in the summary.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/ios-15-2-notification-summary.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Communication Safety</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to iOS 15.2 code, the update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/apple-ios-15-2-communication-safety/\">adds the Communication Safety feature</a> that Apple announced earlier this year. Communication Safety is built into the Messages app on\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac, and it will warn children and their parents when sexually explicit photos are received or sent from a child's device, with Apple using on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments.\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/everything-new-ios-15-2/\">Everything New in iOS 15.2: App Privacy Report and Auto Call Updates</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-new-in-ios-15-2-app-privacy-report-and-auto-call-updates.2319978/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XSDn34upwu0:8Z8jMkoP7Tg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XSDn34upwu0:8Z8jMkoP7Tg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XSDn34upwu0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0b1222658295944cba42ae7780e623d3fa2b0dd87e60f9c79454f028ba5b5306","category":"Apple"}
