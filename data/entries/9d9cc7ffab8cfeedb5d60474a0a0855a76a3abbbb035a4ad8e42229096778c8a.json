Apple has traditionally held Mac events in late October or early November. In 2020, the event to introduce the M1 chip took place on November 10, while in 2019, new Mac mini, MacBook Air, and iPad Pro devices launched on October 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s California Streaming event will be held on Tuesday, September 14, and we expect Apple to unveil four models of the iPhone 3, a new Apple Watch Series 7, and possibly third-generation AirPods. Still to come at the rumored second fall event is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348867/2021-ipad-mini-design-display-price-release.html\">a new redesigned iPad mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348015/apple-ipad-ipad-mini-ipad-pro-bezels-home-button-wireless-charging-airpower.html\">entry-level iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-price-release.html\">14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros</a>, and possibly <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/2021-mac-mini-design-m1x-price-release.html\">a Mac mini</a>. </p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9d9cc7ffab8cfeedb5d60474a0a0855a76a3abbbb035a4ad8e42229096778c8a","category":"Apple"}
