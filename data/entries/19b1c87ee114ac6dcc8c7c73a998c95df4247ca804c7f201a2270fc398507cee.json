Maia has 105 billion transistors that are manufactured on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nm_process\">5-nm</a> TSMC process. Meanwhile, Cobalt is a 128-core ARM-based CPU designed to do conventional computing tasks like power Microsoft Teams. Microsoft has no plans to sell either one, preferring them for internal use only.</p>\n<p>As we've previously seen, Microsoft wants to be \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/bing-chat-is-now-microsoft-copilot-in-potentially-confusing-rebranding-move/\">the Copilot company</a>,\" and it will need a lot of computing power to meet that goal. According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-introduces-its-own-chips-ai-with-eye-cost-2023-11-15/\">Reuters</a>, Microsoft and other tech firms have struggled with the high cost of delivering AI services that can cost 10 times more than services like search engines.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984078#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984078&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19b1c87ee114ac6dcc8c7c73a998c95df4247ca804c7f201a2270fc398507cee","category":"Tech"}
