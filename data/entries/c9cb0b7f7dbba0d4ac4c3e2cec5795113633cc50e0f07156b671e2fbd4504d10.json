These stipulations apply to all companies manufacturing or selling smart devices in the UK.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor Apple, the law will necessitate a review of how its products comply with these enhanced standards. While Apple devices do not use default passwords, the company will need to ensure that all of its connected devices sold in the UK clearly communicate the duration of security support to customers. In addition, affected companies are expected to establish or refine their contact points for security issue reporting. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRetailers such as Apple stores are also required to provide customers with point-of-sale information about the cybersecurity practices relevant to the devices they purchase. The PSTI Act also includes strict penalties for non-compliance, with fines that can reach up to Â£10 million ($12.5 million USD) or 4% of the offending company's global turnover. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/apple-faces-new-uk-cybersecurity-law/\">Apple Faces New Cybersecurity Law in UK</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-faces-new-cybersecurity-law-in-uk.2425138/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c9cb0b7f7dbba0d4ac4c3e2cec5795113633cc50e0f07156b671e2fbd4504d10","category":"Apple"}
