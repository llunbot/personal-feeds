After years of reading DF I’m finally a sponsor! But for a personal passion project, not a product. </p>\n\n<p>I want to make cloud security knowledge accessible to anyone, with or without security or cloud experience, for free. Cloud Security Lab a Week delivers a 15-30 minute lab to your inbox, RSS feed, or YouTube.
