It’s also their first wedge-style tent. I’ve had some experience with Yakima’s soft shell roof top tent, the SkyRise HD Medium, and reviewed it <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yakima-skyrise-hd-medium-rooftop-tent-rtt-review/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch pop through\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-pop-through-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are T-track slots on the sides and top to add your accessories. With the T-slots, you can mount an awning and cross bars. The available cross bars can hold up to 300 lbs of cargo on top of the tent, so adding your steed, fishing kayak, or even solar panels is no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch SkyPeak HD annex\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-annex-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yakima also offers a large, covered annex room for the SkyPeak HD. Once installed, it would make a great room to get out of the elements, or a private place to change into jammies before you climb up to bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch SkyPeak closing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-closing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can climb into the tent by using one of the three ladder mounting positions, giving it three sided access. Inside are dimmable USB-powered lights, dual pass-through slots for A/C or heaters, solar panel wiring management, organization pockets, and a memory foam mattress with a removable cover and anti-condensation mat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SKyPeak HD dimensions are 85″ x 58″ x 6.5″ closed, with a max interior height of 67.5″ when open.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SkyRise SL &amp; HD</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retial: $2,499 (SKyRise HD), $1,799 (SkyRise SL)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Softshell rooftop tents tend to be a bit lighter than the hardshell versions. Both the SkyRise SL and HD are for the camper that is looking for something lighter, with the SL coming in at 119 lbs, and the HD at 130 lbs. The new SkyRise SL and SkyRise HD both offer fast deployment, a great mattress, and huge panoramic windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-hero-.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"952\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-hero-.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch SkyPeak HD hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-hero-.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-hero--297x221.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-hero--120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-SkyPeak-HD-hero--768x571.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also new for 2025, all three tents now get a newly custom-designed ladder that has curved rungs that are barefoot (or sockfoot) compatible (comfortable).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>OverNOut awnings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $999 (OverNOut 270 XL), $949 (OverNOut 270 LG), $799 (OverNOut 180), $389 (OverNOut MD), $329 (OverNOut SM)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-hero-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Yakima)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Throwing shade just got easier, and finding the right size awning for your needs just got better.

Stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-drawers.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"952\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-drawers.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch MOD system drawers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-drawers.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-drawers-297x221.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-drawers-120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-drawers-768x571.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MOD System is designed to maximize your storage space and keep all of your essentials within easy reach and organized. The beauty of the MOD System is that it’s a non-permanent, modular system: Simply attach the <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-homebase\" target=\"_blank\">MOD HomeBase</a> to existing tie-down points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t worry, if your vehicle doesn’t have tie-down points, there’s a <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-fit-kit-1\" target=\"_blank\">MOD Fit Kit</a> for you. Once tied down, you can start building your ideal setup. It has the flexibility and customization to fit all your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-stuff-on-top.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"952\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-stuff-on-top.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch MOD system stuff on top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-stuff-on-top.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-stuff-on-top-297x221.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-stuff-on-top-120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-stuff-on-top-768x571.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MOD System can be built into more than 30 configurations when paired with various available accessories. The foundation of the system is the MOD HomeBase. It has built-in attachment points for the MOD Toppers (half-size drawer add-ons, featuring the same premium bamboo finish as HomeBase). Then you can add the MOD GearCrates, which are premium, quick-attach, lidded totes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The super convenient <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-geartote\" target=\"_blank\">MOD GearTotes</a> fold down flat and are lidless totes, perfect for easy-in/easy-out storage. When adding the <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-micrototes\" target=\"_blank\">MicroTotes</a> you can dial in your drawer organization to another level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-work-space.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"952\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-work-space.webp\" alt=\"Yakima 2025 Product Launch MOD system work space\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-work-space.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-work-space-297x221.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-work-space-120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Yakima-2025-Product-Launch-MOD-system-work-space-768x571.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding accessories like the <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-work-space\" target=\"_blank\">MOD Work Space</a>, which is a drop-in tabletop for the HomeBase drawer, and the<a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-fridge-slide-mounting-kit\" target=\"_blank\"> Fridge Slide Kit</a> for Dometic powered cooler, you are reaching pro-level organization. Use the <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-stretch-net\" target=\"_blank\">Stretch Cargo Net</a> that attaches to the Toppers to keep items from sliding around on top of the MOD System. Finally, add the <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/mod-riser-kit\" target=\"_blank\">Riser Kit</a> to allow the HomeBase drawers to clear hatch openings or to simply add storage underneath your HomeBase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://yakima.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yakima.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yakima-first-hardshell-rooftop-tent-awnings-cargo-storage-rooftop-box-e-bike-rack-2025/\">Yakima Introduces Their First Hardshell Rooftop Tent, Plus New Awnings, Cargo Storage &amp; More!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c47ebe31a4918ca3cede8d987b0fca4520da0646996847894358318cedf69986","category":"Cycling"}
