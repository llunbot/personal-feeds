And there are almost 2 million of them; the two countries are the world’s largest cocoa producers, supplying two-thirds of the global supply. Cocoa is the primary perennial crop in both places.</p>\n<p>However, there are no up-to-date, accurate maps of their cocoa plantations. This is a problem since cocoa is known to be a primary driver of deforestation in the region. Besides decimating biodiversity that may never recover, clear-cutting forests to plant cocoa (or for any other reason) makes it hotter and makes storms stronger, both <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deforestation-strengthens-storms-in-west-africa/\">locally in Africa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/09/magazine/hurricane-saildrone.html\">across the planet</a>.</p>\n<p>So a team of European researchers made a deep neural network to collate publicly available satellite images of both countries with georeferenced cocoa farms, identified by their regular polygons. They then had a team in Côte d'Ivoire trekking around for three months to visit the farms and verify their results.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942535#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942535&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Diana Gitig","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1fd6ef7f10635ca001e8d01c7c305c1c69c3d8e2e8d6a12802b78892db14eb16","category":"Tech"}
