This time around, however, Bittner and Eekhoff debuted the technology at the Hell of the North.</p>\n<p>The two riders were selected to use the Scope Atmoz as Team DSM had hoped they would make the day’s break. Eekhoff attempted to jump across to an escape group that broke clear after more than 80km but failed to bridge despite a long chase.</p>\n<p>Still, Paris-Roubaix gave us the chance to get up close with the €3,998 system on the bikes of Bittner and Eekhoff, so let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>How the Scope Atmoz works</h3>\n<p>The Atmoz comprises of a hub-mounted unit on each wheel, tyre pressure sensors, a proprietary valve stem, air lines and a USB-rechargeable battery.</p>\n<p>The hub unit, housing the electronics, connects to the Scope valve stem via two air lines to inflate and deflate a tubeless tyre.</p>\n<p>The hub communicates wirelessly to a unit (which looks similar to a Di2 junction box) attached to the stem, connected to two handlebar-mounted buttons (one for each wheel/tyre).</p>\n<p>These buttons allow the rider to inflate and deflate their tyres by up to 0.5 bar / 7.3 psi per second.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Up close with the Scope Atmoz</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pavel Bittner and Nils Eekhoff debuted the Scope Atmoz tyre pressure management system for Team DSM at Paris-Roubaix.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Scope Atmoz allows a rider to wirelessly inflate and deflate a tyre on the fly, using buttons mounted to the handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Atmoz weighs 300g (per wheel), according to Scope, and can be used with any 700c or 29in wheel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hub unit contains the electronics and attaches to Scope’s proprietary valve stem via two hoses.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A Team DSM mechanic makes some last-minute adjustments before the Hell of the North.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The air hoses run along the spokes before attaching to the valve stem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Team DSM used 32mm Vittoria Corsa Next tubeless tyres at Paris-Roubaix.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hub communicates wirelessly with this box attached to the underside of the stem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Two buttons – one for the front tyre and one for the rear – are wired to the communications box.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These allow the rider to increase or decrease tyre pressure at a touch of a button.
