{"title":"Apple Security Research: ‘Private Cloud Compute: A New Frontier for AI Privacy in the Cloud’","link":"https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/","date":1718726880000,"content":"\n<p>Apple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We designed Private Cloud Compute to ensure that privileged access doesn’t allow anyone to bypass our stateless computation guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>First, we intentionally did not include remote shell or interactive debugging mechanisms on the PCC node. Our Code Signing machinery prevents such mechanisms from loading additional code, but this sort of open-ended access would provide a broad attack surface to subvert the system’s security or privacy. Beyond simply not including a shell, remote or otherwise, PCC nodes cannot enable Developer Mode and do not include the tools needed by debugging workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we built the system’s observability and management tooling with privacy safeguards that are designed to prevent user data from being exposed. For example, the system doesn’t even include a general-purpose logging mechanism. Instead, only pre-specified, structured, and audited logs and metrics can leave the node, and multiple independent layers of review help prevent user data from accidentally being exposed through these mechanisms. With traditional cloud AI services, such mechanisms might allow someone with privileged access to observe or collect user data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many details here, but many still to come.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/18/apple-private-cloud-compute\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c99ade2bc0b85bfa9beb3b12583936f3fe97f1a05867ae45a141112115aeacd0","category":"Tech"}
