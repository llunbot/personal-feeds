Earlier this month, OpenAI announced a new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-and-whisper-apis-debut-allowing-devs-to-integrate-them-into-apps/\">API interface</a> for its popular large language model (LLM) and preferential commercial access called \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/sorry-in-advance-snapchat-warns-of-hallucinations-with-new-ai-conversation-bot/\">Foundry</a>.\" The ChatGPT API allows companies to easily build AI-powered generative text into their apps, and companies like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/sorry-in-advance-snapchat-warns-of-hallucinations-with-new-ai-conversation-bot/\">Snapchat</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/wikipedia-ai-truth-duckduckgo-hopes-so-with-new-answerbot/\">DuckDuckGo</a> are already getting on the bandwagon with their own implementations of OpenAI's tools.</p>\n<p>In this case, Discord is using OpenAI's tech to upgrade its existing robot, called \"Clyde.\" The update, coming next week, will allow Clyde to answer questions, engage in conversations, and recommend playlists. Users will be able to chat with Clyde in any channel by typing \"@Clyde\" in a server, and the bot will reportedly also be able to start a thread for group chats.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922929#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922929&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f8542dbbc062be4a80cb6bb187f37174edd4f9a098b7904d314e51","category":"Tech"}
