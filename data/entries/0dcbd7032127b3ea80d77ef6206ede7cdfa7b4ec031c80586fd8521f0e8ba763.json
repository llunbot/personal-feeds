The move could have a large impact on the hearing aid market, which has already been recently shaken up by over-the-counter models.</p>\n<p>Gurman writes that AirPods Pro are due to receive a hearing-aid function in iOS 18, arriving this fall and likely to be announced and outlined at a Worldwide Developers Conference in June. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-studying-potential-of-airpods-as-health-device-11634122800?mod=hp_lead_pos10\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> in the fall of 2021 that Apple was working toward a future AirPods Pro model that functioned as a hearing aid and would also be able to monitor body posture and even body temperature.</p>\n<p>It was not clear from Gurman or the Journal's reporting whether the hearing aid function would be available only in a new model of AirPods Pro or offered as a software update on prior models. Since the Journal's report, Apple has released both a second-generation model of AirPods Pro and a refresh of that model with a USB-C port.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009584#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009584&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0dcbd7032127b3ea80d77ef6206ede7cdfa7b4ec031c80586fd8521f0e8ba763","category":"Tech"}
