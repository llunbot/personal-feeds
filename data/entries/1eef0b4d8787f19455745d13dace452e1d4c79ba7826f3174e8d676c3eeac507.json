However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced image quality for photos and videos. It is recommended to avoid exposing your iPhone to extended high-amplitude vibrations.</blockquote>Due to this risk, Apple recommends that users not attach their iPhones directly to the chassis or handlebars of such motorcycles, as direct transmission of vibrations can be intense. Apple even recommends that users mounting their devices to lower-powered devices like mopeds and electric scooters at least use a vibration-dampening mount to minimize the chances of any damage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>First ride on the motorcycle and I think I toasted the camera in my iPhone.<br /><br />8 miles.

Vibrations can more easily result in permanent damage to the systems.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll ‌iPhone‌ models from the ‌iPhone‌ 7 onward, as well as the ‌iPhone‌ 6 Plus and ‌iPhone‌ 6s Plus, have OIS and/or closed-loop AF and are potentially affected.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/\">iPhone XR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12-Pro\">iPhone 12 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/\">Apple Warns Vibrations Like Those From High-Power Motorcycle Engines Can Harm iPhone Cameras</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-warns-vibrations-like-those-from-high-power-motorcycle-engines-can-harm-iphone-cameras.2310335/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4Q5N-7Sj3Tw:gL4ssXybBPM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4Q5N-7Sj3Tw:gL4ssXybBPM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4Q5N-7Sj3Tw\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1eef0b4d8787f19455745d13dace452e1d4c79ba7826f3174e8d676c3eeac507","category":"Apple"}
