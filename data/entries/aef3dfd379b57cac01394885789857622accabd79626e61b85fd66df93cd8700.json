In the blog post, titled \"<a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/\">The beginning of the end of the password</a>,\" Google says: \"We’ve begun rolling out support for passkeys across Google Accounts on all major platforms. They’ll be an additional option that people can use to sign in, alongside passwords, 2-Step Verification (2SV), etc.\" Previously, you've been able to use a passkey with a Google account as part of two-factor authentication, but that was always <em>in addition to</em> a password. Now it's possible to use a Google account with a passkey <em>instead of</em> a password.</p>\n<p>A passkey, if you haven't heard of the new authentication method, is a new way to log in to apps and websites and may someday replace a password. Password entry began as a simple text box for humans, and those text boxes slowly had automation and complication bolted onto them as the desire for higher security arrived. While you used to type a remembered word into a password field, today, the right way to use a password is to have a password manager paste a random string of characters into the password box. Since few of us physically type in our passwords, passkeys remove the password box.</p>\n<p>Passkeys have your operating system directly swap public-private keypairs—the \"<a href=\"https://webauthn.guide/\">WebAuthn</a>\" standard—with a website, and that's how you get authenticated. Google's demo of how this will work on a phone looks great—the usual box asks for your Google username, then instead of a password, it asks for a fingerprint, which unlocks the passkey system, and you're logged in.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936276#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936276&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aef3dfd379b57cac01394885789857622accabd79626e61b85fd66df93cd8700","category":"Tech"}
