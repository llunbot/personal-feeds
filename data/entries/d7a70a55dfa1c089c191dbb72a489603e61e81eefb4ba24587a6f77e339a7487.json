Sony increased the price of the Digital Edition by $50 at the launch of the new Slim consoles, so this deal effectively brings the price back down to the level of the original PS5 Digital Edition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://howl.me/clUh1erQcL6\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>PS5 Slim Spider-Man 2 Bundle for $449.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth bundles also include the Spider-Man 2 game as a digital download, which is an extra value worth $69.99 when not on sale. You can also find video game gift cards on sale at Best Buy this week, as well as Nintendo Switch consoles and games.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>TVs</h3>\r<br />\nA highlight of the TV sale at Best Buy is a new offer that includes a free 65-inch class Samsung 4K TV, and free installation, when you purchase select Samsung TVs. Additionally, My Best Buy Plus/Total members can save $100 on these TVs. You can <a href=\"https://howl.me/clYYgUPB85H\">find the full list of eligible TVs</a> on Best Buy's website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://howl.me/clYYnahAKDc\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>SITEWIDE SALE</div>Best Buy TV Deals</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, there are many more deals on TVs beyond Samsung, including big savings on LG, TCL, Sony, Hisense, and Insignia.
