This may account for the discernible absence of testosterone in the air as riders of all sizes, genders and ages gather for the start in the genteel surroundings of Alyth Bowling Club in Scotland. We will be heading off-road into the Perthshire Hills but are reassured ‘The Broom Wagon of Eternal Shame’ will only ever be a phone call away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know whether ‘bunch’ is the right collective noun for a group of bikepackers – it seems appropriately less formal than ‘peloton’ – but I quickly learn that while riding with company off-road may not offer any drafting benefits, it does provide other perks. Firstly, there will be regular gates to be passed through during the next 48 hours and the person at the front will be the one expected to wrestle with a mind-boggling array of latch mechanisms and tautly sprung ‘pull and release’ lever systems, so it pays to position yourself mid-bunch.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mallorca-kill-the-hill-sportive\">Mallorca’s secret climb: Riding the Kill the Hill sportive</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-alaskas-denali-landslide\">Bikepacking Alaska’s Denali landslide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/girodeo-girona-sportive\">Saddle up, hold on: GiRodeo sportive review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The second advantage is navigation. We’ve all been sent GPX files but it’s inevitable that the ‘real world’ will occasionally diverge from the route as shown on our screens. The more people in your group, the better the chance that at least one of them will be able to read the map properly. (Spoiler alert: that person won’t be me.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after the bunch splits – less to do with the pace than with riders stopping to take photos of an ancient stone circle – I find my way barred by a wall and have to choose whether to turn left and uphill or right and downhill. Just above me, two riders are pushing their bikes up the steep, rocky slope.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cateran Dirt Dash\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘You look like you’ve done this before,’ I shout up to them. Instead of receiving an encouraging affirmation that would inspire me to blindly follow them to the ends of the earth, I hear, ‘Yes, we have. And we were rubbish at it then too.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recalling the perennial cycling proverb, ‘The only way down is up’, I start pushing my bike towards them. The taller of the two is Ben, who I learn is a former professional astronomer who now designs medical imaging software. If he can’t navigate us to safety, I reason, then no one can.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rocks and roll</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our route largely sticks to the Cateran Trail – named after a notorious gang of cattle thieves – which comprises cart tracks, gravel trails and footpaths hewn into a landscape of purple-tinged moorland, brooding mountains and metallic-grey lochs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My contemplation of these natural wonders is abruptly interrupted by a muffled grunt and the sound of something soft meeting something solid behind us. Another rider has resisted dismounting and attempted to pedal his way through the chaos of protruding stones that scar the hillside. These stones have been here for 500 million-odd years but it’s hard to respect them when they keep trying to send you flying over your handlebars.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cateran Dirt Dash\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The field is waved off at the official start outside Alyth Bowls Club – all shapes, ages, genders and types of bike are present and correct.</figcaption><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘It’s OK, I’m fine!’ he shouts as he bounces to his feet with only his dignity and left-hand brake lever slightly scuffed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The distance for day one is 42km, which doesn’t sound much but it’s nearly all off-road and includes over 1,000m of climbing. Plus, we are carrying our bed and board on our bikes. There is no luxury hotel with power shower and bike valet awaiting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a 40-year-old tent rolled up between my handlebars and when I look at some of the other riders with their bulging panniers or rucksacks I feel a smug sense of superiority. This is especially so at the end of the first day when we have to ascend 400m in 6km on what starts out as a perfectly navigable forestry track but by the top is barely more than a narrow, squelchy rut in the hillside.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cateran Dirt Dash\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The tricky final climb of Day One. No one from the organisers knew what it was actually called and there’s nothing on any maps of the area.</figcaption><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There is a chance for a breather during the climb at a bothy called Upper Lunch Hut (where Queen Victoria apparently had a picnic in 1865). Waiting there to greet us is Bob Ellis from local conservation group the Cateran Ecomuseum. He’s an older gentleman and it’s not apparent how he arrived at this remote location looking distinctly fresher than the rest of us. Pointing to the saddle between two peaks that will be the highest point of our journey (642m), he says with benign authority, ‘It’s 35 minutes to the top. No one has ever managed to ride all the way up.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure enough, exactly 35 minutes later, a small group of us arrives at the summit to be met by what the event blurb had boldly promised is ‘one of the finest views in Scotland’. The view down to the Spittal of Glenshee, with the A93 winding its way up to the UK’s highest mountain pass – the Cairnwell, just 30m higher than where we are right now – certainly impresses. It’s then a treacherous descent, weaving through those prehistoric rocks, to our campsite beside a river.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cateran Dirt Dash\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Day Two and the glorious trail that follows the course of the Shee Water in Glenshee.</figcaption><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As instructed, I’ve packed a bowl, mug and cutlery. We have been spared having to bring cooking equipment by the provision of a hot meal served from the hatch of a nearby cafe, but I have serious ‘bowl envy’ as I compare my small aluminium receptacle to my co-riders’ dustbin lid plates.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s as I’m returning from the cafe that it starts raining and a high-pitched droning in my ear alerts me to that other scourge of a Scottish summer – the midge. It’s only then I realise the full horror of my decision to stay faithful to my ancient tent, which resembles a canvas coffin next to its more modern counterparts. I am going to have to disrobe, sort out and store all my essentials – sleeping bag, inflatable mat, phone, bike computer, power pack, headtorch, shoes, warm clothes – in a space not much bigger than a bread bin.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cateran Dirt Dash\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/cateran-dirt-dash-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Cateran Ecomuseum representative Bob Ellis hands out energy bars at Upper Lunch Hut on the climb.</figcaption><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Left, right, left… right?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Day Two starts off gloriously.
