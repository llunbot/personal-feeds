The app works by linking to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/strava\">Strava</a> and collecting data on the distance ridden, totting up the kilometres and providing a countdown to when things need to be checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app also helps check the alignment of handlebars, and more functionality is promised in the future, such as taking riding and weather conditions into account when assessing component wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Track your maintenance schedule</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed bike app\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/CeramicSpeed-app-21.jpg 1232w\" /><figcaption>CeramicSpeed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several similar apps on the market already, but CeramicSpeed says its one is particularly sophisticated. CeramicSpeed’s Emil Dahl Mathiasen tells us that the brand’s technical team has used its best estimate of when different components need to be serviced, or at least checked. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ceramicspeed-ufo-drip-wet-conditions-wax-lube-review\">CeramicSpeed UFO Drip Wet Conditions wax lube review</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain\">Best bike chain: How to choose a replacement chain</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/strava-how-to-use\">Strava: Complete guide to the fitness tracking app</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-ceramic-bearings-worth-it\">Are ceramic bearings worth it?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-adjust-headset-bearings\">How to adjust headset bearings</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Intervals are different for different drivetrain components, with the default for when a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">road bike</a> or time trial bike chain needs <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-check-your-bikes-chain-for-wear-and-stretch\">checking for wear</a> 5,000km or 180 days. The equivalent figures for bottom bracket bearings are 7,500km or 365 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">gravel bike</a>, those distance figures drop to 4,000km for the chain and 6,000km for the bottom bracket and they’re even lower for cyclocross bikes or mountain bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Service intervals can be amended though, if it is found that they’re too short or too long for the specific bike and/or the riding done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of multiple bikes, the app keeps separate tallies for each, provided the specific bike has been logged for each ride on Strava.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CeramicSpeed is looking to get even cleverer in future by incorporating weather data, so that its recommended maintenance routine can take account of the difference between a winter training bike ridden through puddles and a time trial bike only used on dry summer mornings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plus a handlebar alignment checker</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed bike app\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/JG_230606_CeramicSpeed_Testing_And_SLT_2347-large.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>CeramicSpeed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At launch, the app also includes a handlebar alignment checker tool. It works off a picture taken of the rider’s bars and front wheel, which the CeramicSpeed app processes to determine if they are out of alignment and by how many degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you travel with your bike or have ever had to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-adjust-headset-bearings\">adjust the headset bearings</a>, you’ll know that getting the alignment correct is fiddly and it’s difficult to be sure that you’ve got it quite set up correctly before tightening your stem bolts, so some independent corroboration can prove useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CeramicSpeed’s Mathiasen says that there’s more on the way. But for now the CeramicSpeed app looks like a useful extra tool to keep abreast of your maintenance and set-up needs. It’s available to download now for <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ceramicspeed-bike-app/id1635549762?uo=2\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceramicspeed.bikeapp\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> phone users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Not sure which chain you need when it comes time for replacement?
