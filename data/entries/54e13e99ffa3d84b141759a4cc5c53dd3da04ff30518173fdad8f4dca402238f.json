(“<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33185\">Shifting Patterns of Social Interaction: Exploring the Social Life of Urban Spaces Through A.I.</a>”)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not sure what made the researchers pick those three cities, but in my experience they’re the only three cities in America where people walk at a reasonable clip.</p>\n\n<p>(Sidenote: #1 on Hendricks’s list was an item claiming that Firefox and Chrome users tend to be happier and more satisfied employees than Internet Explorer or Safari users, because they’re the sort of non-conformist thinkers who install third-party web browsers rather than use the system default. As if the inclusion of “Internet Explorer” weren’t hint enough that one should be skeptical of this claim, <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/what-your-web-browser-says-about-you/news-story/c577c19e272aadaa18bc82fe2a456957\">the cited source is an article from 2016</a>, and the study only applied to people with jobs as customer service agents. Chrome has 66 percent market share for desktop browsers today — pretty sure using it doesn’t make one a non-conformist.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/30/52-things-kent-hendricks-learned-in-2024\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"54e13e99ffa3d84b141759a4cc5c53dd3da04ff30518173fdad8f4dca402238f","category":"Tech"}
