Apple also provides manuals so that customers can repair their devices without having to visit an Apple retail location or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Repairs have been available for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/22/apple-expands-self-service-repair-program-to-macbook-air-and-macbook-pro/\">Apple's notebooks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/20/apple-self-service-repair-mac-desktops/\">desktops</a> since 2022, but repair components and instructions for the M3 models were just made available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe support document covering the M3 MacBook Pro models details replacing the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/103908\">bottom casing of a MacBook</a>, the parts needed to make a repair, and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/103897\">what tools</a> are necessary to complete the repair. For the ‌iMac‌, Apple provides a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/105134\">detailed list of part numbers</a> required for various repairs on the display, logic board, fans, housing, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the time of writing, some of the part numbers listed in the support documents are not available on Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/\">Self Service Repair</a> Store, but we will likely see them added soon. It is not clear when Apple plans to announce the expansion of the repair program to M3 Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicolas09F9\">Nicolás Álvarez</a>!)</em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Update: Now Live</h2>\r<br />\nFollowing our report, Apple has added parts for the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and ‌iMac‌ with M3, M3 Pro, and/or M3 Max chips to its <a href=\"https://selfservicerepair.com/en-US/order\">self-service repair store</a> in the U.S. and select European countries.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/\">Self Service Repair</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/apple-self-service-repair-m3-macs/\">Apple Expands Do-It-Yourself Repair Program to M3 Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-do-it-yourself-repair-program-to-m3-macs.2420691/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Aaron Perris","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a17afd96473f73806180ede96dcefb985d9de8daa3ff5b8bf65b1605b146e6a5","category":"Apple"}
