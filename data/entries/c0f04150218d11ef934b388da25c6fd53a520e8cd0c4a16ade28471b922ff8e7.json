While we were expecting an update for the iPad mini at some sort of Apple event toward the end of the month, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/\">Apple dropped the announcement via press release this week</a> sooner than expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-thumb.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nWith the iPad mini having received a design overhaul in the last generation released in 2021, this year's design remains the same, but there are number of internal upgrades led by an A17 Pro chip to add support for upcoming Apple Intelligence features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/ipad-mini-7-smaller-changes/\">a number of smaller changes</a> such as faster USB-C data speeds, so be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6-vs-7/\">full buyer's guide comparison</a> to see what's changed between the sixth- and seventh-generation iPad mini models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Is an Apple Event Still Likely This October Following This Week's Surprise iPad Mini 7 Announcement?</h2>\r<br />\nThe new iPad mini launching via press release this week is just one sign <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/will-there-be-an-october-2024-apple-event/\">calling into question whether Apple is going to hold its rumored October product event at all</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/October-Event-Canceled-Thumb-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWhile we hadn't heard many specific rumors, another product on the potential event docket had been an 11th-generation iPad, but with Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/apple-reduces-pad-price-europe-no-charger/\">cutting the price of the 10th-generation model in Europe</a> and removing the power adapter from the box there this week, a near-term update for that product <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/ipad-11-now-seems-unlikely-this-year/\">now appears unlikely</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYet, we are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/will-apple-release-new-macs-soon-latest-rumors/\">expecting a host of M4-based Mac updates</a> to arrive very shortly, including a major redesign for the Mac mini, so there still seems to be enough for Apple to show off in a short virtual event if it chooses to do so.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 18.1 Includes Option to Set 'Primary' Email Address and Change iCloud Email</h2>\r<br />\nAs we continue to inch toward a public release for iOS 18.1 and related updates, we're still discovering new features and tweaks in the update.
