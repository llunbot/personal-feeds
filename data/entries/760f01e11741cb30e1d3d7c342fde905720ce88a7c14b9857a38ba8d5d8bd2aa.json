The difference lies in the software. We iPhone users swear by iOS, and why not? It’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670535/iphone-vs-android-best-smartphone.html\">better than Android</a>. (Angry emails to the usual address.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile operating systems, of course, are already trending towards similarity, much like the hardware they run on. Apple and Google frequently adopt each other’s OS features, and that can only be a good thing for the customer. Nobody wants app offloading or RCS support to be a platform exclusive. These aren’t game consoles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s a difference between the free marketplace of ideas and blatant imitation, and Apple’s rivals have been known to adopt, not one or two general concepts, but its entire way of doing things. Occasionally the mimicry is so uncanny that one would <em>almost</em> suspect they’re trying to trick customers into thinking they’re holding an iPhone when they’re not. Of course, that can’t possibly be the case. But you do wonder…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Samsung <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-starts-to-roll-out-in-select-markets\">announced</a> the release of its One UI 7 mobile OS in public beta, and to say that it looks a lot like iOS 18, from the arrangement of onscreen elements to the overall design language, would be an understatement. The leaker Ice Universe loaded up matching wallpapers on two handsets for a direct comparison and <a href=\"https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1864548503000895902\">the results</a> are astonishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to understand the difference between ideas and execution. As you can see above, iOS 18 and One UI 7 both have Now Playing music widgets on the lock screen, for example, and that’s perfectly reasonable; whoever thought of it first, it’s fair for the idea to be adopted by other companies in time. But for the widgets to be rendered in such a similar way, achieving such a similar look, is where the imitation becomes hard to justify. It starts to stray closer and closer to the legal concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_off\">passing off</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"One UI 7 and iOS 18: Control Center\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2112w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/One-UI-7-vs-iOS-18-Control-Center.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Control Center (right) and something that looks an awful lot like Control Center.</figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1864548503000895902\" target=\"_blank\">Ice Universe</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One UI 7’s equivalent of Control Center is jarringly familiar, too: a grid of semi-transparent grey circles and squircles with white sans serif text labels. And its camera interface, which isn’t shown in Ice Universe’s comparison but can be seen in Samsung’s official announcement article, has been pretty much Xeroxed (perhaps an unfortunate verb to use, given Apple’s own <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668532/11-innovations-apple-copied-but-not-from-the-firms-youd-expect.html\">history of imitation</a>) from the same function in iOS. At least pretend to be doing your own thing, guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, perhaps, we might wonder whether this sort of thing matters. Eventually the smartphone will become fully commoditized, if it hasn’t been already, and products will compete on price and the general appearance of quality rather than on unique and identifiable characteristics. Buying a smartphone will start to feel a bit like buying a potato, only with slightly higher stakes. It’s also understandable that companies with a generic brand, like Samsung, will be happier to see that future arrive than those like Apple with a strong and carefully cultivated aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, it does make me wonder if Samsung has thought this through properly. Yes, Apple has the most to lose if all the mobile OSes become indistinguishable. But Samsung is still a premium brand, even if it isn’t exactly known for its originality, and it might be surprised by how little customers are willing to spend on a smartphone, and how rarely they’ll be inclined to upgrade, if they realise that one handset is pretty much the same as another.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.
