From Apple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To help ensure that your AirPods microphones and speakers are\noperating at their best (for example, to help provide\nhigh-quality hearing test results), your AirPods may periodically\nplay a quiet chime when they’re in their charging case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Information on the mysterious chime was <a href=\"https://mastodon.online/@tuckerjj/113797353737201900\">highlighted on\nMastodon</a> after Apple’s unclear AirPods sounds were\ndiscussed on today’s <a href=\"https://atp.fm/\">ATP podcast</a>. As noted on the\npodcast, Apple does not have an established guide that provides\ninsight into the different sounds that the AirPods make, so it can\nbe confusing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Years ago, Apple was a successful company and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/docs/ipod/133017\">documented</a> how their products work. These days, Apple is struggling financially, and alas can no longer afford to produce something even as simple as an interactive web page with examples of the sounds that AirPods make and explanations of what those sounds mean.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/09/airpods-pro-beeps-and-bops\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"42d4aada152b45c7a1a4871382117ad8464ec8ae114d1b6d224c9b2d5b45651b","category":"Tech"}
