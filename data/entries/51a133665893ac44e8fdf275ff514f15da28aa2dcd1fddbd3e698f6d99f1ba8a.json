The media coverage afterwards celebrated his “mental toughness”. But concussion is serious – it can have long-term effects on mental health and can lead to depression later in life. We’re saying someone is mentally tough for ignoring their own wellbeing and I don’t think that’s something that should be celebrated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Mental toughness has become a very outdated concept, while mental “flexibility” has been found to be far more effective.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/motivation-on-long-rides\">Tunisia Diaries: How I’m staying motivated on a 2,000km ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-breathe-cycling\">How to breathe better when cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/dr-elisabetta-borgia-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 79: Trek-Segafredo psychologist Dr Elisabetta Borgia on the cyclist’s inner monologue</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/dr-josie-perry-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 78: Fear, pain and motivation with sports psychologist Dr Josie Perry</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>What is mental flexibility?

You have to actively acknowledge your thoughts, which requires much more attention and energy. Meditation is a great tool for this.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How should we manage a situation that’s out of our control?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"two cyclists, one in blue, one in red and white, riding over cobbled road with fans either side and yellow motorbike and cameraman behind\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/philippe-gilbert-paris-roubaix-aso-pauline-ballet-3.jpeg 1000w\" /><figcaption>ASO/Pauline Ballet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The most effective way to deal with a situation we can’t control is to accept it,’ says Dr Elisabetta Borgia, clinical and sports psychologist at Lidl-Trek. ‘Fighting against things we cannot control is a waste of energy. Instead we should accept them, try to understand them and work on improving the situation step by step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For example, if you have to ride Paris-Roubaix, which has cobbles and poor weather conditions that you can’t control, and you don’t like either of these things, then look at what you can control and improve this in your training.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I would advise a rider to look at things like tyre pressure and bike position to help them have a more comfortable ride, as well as doing a proper recon of the route and looking at kit choices and which materials best protect them from the cold and wet. These are all things the rider can control, so when it comes to race day they can say, “I know I’ve worked and done my best to be ready. I’m as prepared as I can be.”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s also important to accept that cycling is hard sometimes – it’s supposed to be and that’s why you love it,’ adds Perry. ‘This doesn’t mean you have to beat yourself up over it. Instead you have to learn many different mental skills and choose the right ones at the right time to help yourself in difficult situations.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How beneficial is self-talk? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist eating sweetcorn out of tin outside supermarket\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/emma-tunisia-day7-kit-motivation-12.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Self-talk is defined as the expression of an internal position and it should be affirmative and positive,’ says Borgia. ‘Often when I analyse a rider’s self-talk from a previous race, it is negative and they use phrases like “the others are stronger” or the athlete doubts themselves and says things like, “Do I wait or do I attack?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The first step is to be aware of what you are telling yourself. Often it is so automatic you are not aware of your thoughts. It’s easier to think when in training than in a race, so it’s good practice to be conscious of your thoughts when you’re on a training ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perry agrees: ‘There’s a technique called “think aloud” where you record your thoughts when you cycle, which is easier on the turbo or by talking to a coach. You want to notice what comes up when you aren’t actively listening. Doing things like jigsaws, swimming, a really easy training session or a very slow run can be a good opportunity to try that. But it has to be with no headphones, nothing to distract you – just you in some space. That helps you notice your thoughts and better prepare for them.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does it all come down to? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-970x659.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist in red punches air\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-970x659.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-300x204.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-768x522.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-1536x1044.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-2048x1391.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-750x510.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Tour-de-France-2023-goding-3-1140x775.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Colin Flockton/GodingImages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you’ve got the emotional intelligence to understand why you’re doing what you’re doing, and the benefits of that, then that’s huge,’ says Perry. ‘Athletes who are self-aware enough can pick and choose from their toolkit of mental skills and are the people who will be able to go much longer and look after themselves better along the way, while also enjoying what they are doing. Those are the athletes who will have long careers and be better able to deal with adversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When we’re more self-aware, we can do so much more because we are working with the right data. And that’s why failure is so helpful because it gives us the right data. We can understand where we went wrong in a ride and look at how to improve it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s important for riders to know how their emotions work, and to understand the model of our thoughts and behaviours,’ adds Borgia. ‘If you know how they work, you can solve the problem you might be having.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can we be too mentally focussed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Goal-setting is really important, but if we become too fixated on the goal, or over-motivated, we can lose sight of the bigger picture. This can have a negative effect mentally,’ says Borgia. ‘Finding a balance with all the things that matter most to you is the most important thing. This means spending time with friends and family, and having enough energy to do your job as well as train. If you use all your energy up with cycling, you will struggle.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 142 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-mental-training\">Cycle-therapy: How to keep your mind in shape according to sports psychologists</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"51a133665893ac44e8fdf275ff514f15da28aa2dcd1fddbd3e698f6d99f1ba8a","category":"Cycling"}
