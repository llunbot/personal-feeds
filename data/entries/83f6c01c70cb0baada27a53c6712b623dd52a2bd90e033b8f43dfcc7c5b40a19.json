With these action buttons, Gmail users can do things like add an event to the calendar, or set a reminder to pay a bill.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Purchases</strong> - Summary cards will show tracking information for purchases and order details.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Events</strong> - Dinner reservations, concert tickets, and more will be highlighted, and there are options to add events to the calendar, invite others, and get directions.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Bills</strong> - Summary cards can show bills, with an option to get a reminder to pay or to add a due date in Google Tasks.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Travel</strong> - Users can manage reservations, check in for flights, and see important details like hotel checkout times.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nGoogle says that it updated the summary card backend, so key information will be organized across all related emails and updated in real-time. Users can expect to see updates on incoming package deliveries, for example, thanks to the new dynamic version of summary cards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSummary cards will be shown in additional places in Gmail, such as search and a new \"Happening Soon\" section. Happening Soon shows the estimated delivery date of incoming packages, and users will only see the section when there are deliveries. In the future, more types of summary cards will be shown in this section.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPurchase summary cards are rolling out for individual emails in the Gmail for iOS app starting today, and event, bill, and travel summary cards and the Happening Soon section set to launch in the coming months.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gmail/\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/02/gmail-revamped-summary-cards/\">Gmail Gets Revamped Summary Cards for Events, Travel, Tracking Purchases and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gmail-gets-revamped-summary-cards-for-events-travel-tracking-purchases-and-more.2438949/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"83f6c01c70cb0baada27a53c6712b623dd52a2bd90e033b8f43dfcc7c5b40a19","category":"Apple"}
