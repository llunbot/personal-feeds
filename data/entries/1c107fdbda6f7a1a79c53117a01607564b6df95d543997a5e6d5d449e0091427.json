They all work in the same way and are all compatible with a similar range of display devices though, as explained in our buyer’s guide below. Garmin still provides the widest range of rearview radar options and it has also teamed up with Cannondale to include its radar units as part of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-synapse-2025\">SmartSense system</a> fitted to some Cannondale bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for our pick of the best rearview radars available today.

It’s particularly handy when you’re riding fast or descending when wind noise can make it hard to hear and you are likely to be concentrating on what’s ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no substitute for situational awareness when riding though. It’s important to keep your own eyes and ears open and not to rely on your rearview radar, particularly if turning across traffic or making other moves out into the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Detection range</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rearview radar vendors generally quote a detection range of around 140m. In my experience, on a straight road it’s usually significantly greater than this though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on winding roads, vehicles may disappear then reappear from the screen as they become hidden by a bend and re-emerge into view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rearview radars have quite a wide detection angle, so you may get alerts for vehicles travelling parallel to you, for example when you’re on a bike path. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve made a turn onto a side road, you may still be alerted to vehicles continuing on the road you’ve turned off too. Conversely, your radar may not always alert you if a following vehicle has also made the turn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Size, attachment, weight and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all rearview radars have a similar format, with an elongated shell that houses the radar in the bottom portion and usually has a rear light in the top of the unit. They’re attached to the bike with a mount, from which they can be removed, usually with a quarter turn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mount itself is typically attached to the bike’s seatpost with an integrated rubber strap or separate O-ring. It will be designed to angle the radar unit more-or-less horizontally rearward, which is required for the radar to work effectively. There may be multiple adapters to suit different shaped seatposts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most rearview radars are relatively low in weight, but the inclusion of a camera will result in a heavier unit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many cases, the taillight can be configured via its companion app to change its lighting or flash pattern when it detects a vehicle behind, which is designed to increase awareness from the approaching driver. Some include an accelerometer and can function as a brake light too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re riding on wet roads, the radar unit is in the line of fire for wheelspray. That shouldn’t stop it from working and most units are IPX7 ingress protected, so water shouldn’t get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Battery life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery drain can be significant for a rearview radar, particularly if you’ve chosen a lighting pattern that’s battery intensive. You’ll usually get an alert when the battery is running low, so that you can choose to switch to a lower drain light pattern or to switch the taillight off altogether. If you want extra-long runtime, you can often choose to run the radar without the light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head units will usually display an icon to show that there’s a radar connected, so keep an eye on this to make sure that you’re still receiving alerts if your radar’s battery is about to expire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Connectivity and receiving devices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A rearview radar will detect vehicles. But it needs a display device to alert you that it’s identified something, to which it will transmit data via Bluetooth and usually also ANT+. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s usually a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\">cycling computer</a>, which will typically have native display functionality, with a visual and/or audible alert and a bar which appears on one side of the screen with moving icons to indicate the number of vehicles and where they are in relation to you. You may get a different alert for fast-approaching vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a vehicle has passed, you usually get an all-clear alert and the sidebar may disappear from your cycling computer’s screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be able to use a rearview radar brand’s app on a smartphone as a display device, with a similar display which shows detected vehicles and their proximity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-watch\">cycling watches</a> can also link up to a rearview radar; you can download a widget for many Garmin smartwatches which gives you alerts and a proximity display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A final option is a dedicated head unit that attaches to your handlebars. Garmin used to make one, but this appears to have been discontinued and there are not currently any alternatives sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>False positives/negatives</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden with a few different rearview radars and in general they’re a useful adjunct to situational awareness when riding. It’s particularly helpful to know how close an approaching vehicle is, so you’re less likely to be surprised when it overtakes, especially if it’s a close pass merchant who isn’t going to slow down because the road is narrow or there’s an oncoming vehicle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the rearview radar can also be useful if you’re riding fast and may not be able to hear a vehicle behind or look around to see where it is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few disadvantages to be aware of though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rearview radar detects the speed differential between the approaching vehicle and you. If the vehicle is travelling at the same speed, it won’t be detected. So a vehicle that slows down and follows you, waiting to overtake, will disappear from your alert screen. It probably won’t be making much noise either, so make sure to look behind to keep tabs on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple vehicles may not all be detected either, even if in most cases you’ll get a dot on your screen for each one. So don’t assume it’s all clear once one vehicle has passed; there may still be more behind you still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, a rearview radar can warn you of an approaching vehicle when there’s none there. This seems to happen most frequently when it’s windy, probably triggered by tree branches waving. You’ll usually get an alert that disappears quickly without progressing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>False positives are less of a worry than false negatives. Some units seem to be more prone to these than others. Don’t rely on your radar alone, but use your ears and, as emphasised above, always look behind you before initiating a turn across traffic or other manoeuvre. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-rearview-radars\">Best rearview radars 2025: Eyes on the back of your bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1c107fdbda6f7a1a79c53117a01607564b6df95d543997a5e6d5d449e0091427","category":"Cycling"}
