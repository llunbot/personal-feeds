That looks set to change with tvOS 18.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the Apple TV app, Apple is promoting Immersive Videos for Apple Vision Pro, and these include a new button in the description screen that when pressed AirDrops a web link to the user's nearby iOS device.  The feature was discovered by Sigmund Judge in the fifth beta of tvOS 18 that was released to developers on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-5-to-developers/\">Monday</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@sigjudge/post/C-TVD4htBbd\">Threads post</a>, Judge shared a video of the feature in action, saying that it \"gives a preview for some potentially pretty special integrations including the ability to distribute related media like books, soundtracks and AR experiences to iPhone and iPad.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to use the link sharing button elsewhere in tvOS, but it's easy to see how it could provide a variety of useful functions, such as the ability to handoff content for viewing on other devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote> <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@sigjudge/post/C-TVD4htBbd\" target=\"_blank\"> <div><div>  </div> <div> Post by @sigjudge</div> <div> View on Threads</div></div></a></blockquote>\r<br />\n</div>\r<br />\nComing this fall, tvOS 18 will bring a range of additional new features to Apple TVs, including an InSight feature in the TV app that is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in Apple TV+ shows and music. Other new features include 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors, new screen savers with improved controls, and support for Live Captions during FaceTime calls through an iPhone or iPad. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/tvos-18-open-web-links-on-iphone/\">tvOS 18 to Let Apple TV Users Open Web Links on iPhone and iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-18-to-let-apple-tv-users-open-web-links-on-iphone-and-ipad.2433029/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8be477dbefba2056f0b5f05de901ae46c4dbdaa574f2c284034403519785a3d7","category":"Apple"}
