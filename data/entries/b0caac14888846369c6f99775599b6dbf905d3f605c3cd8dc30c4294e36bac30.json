The Studio Display contains an A13 Bionic chip to power its built-in webcam, spatial audio, and support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> voice commands. The Pro Display XDR offers none of these features, so it follows that a second-generation model with an Apple silicon chip would add speakers, microphones, and a webcam.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is possible that a second-generation Pro Display XDR could feature a higher refresh rate, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and perhaps even OLED technology. In July 2023, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/next-pro-display-xdr-rumor-recap/\">reiterated</a> that Apple was still working on multiple next-generation monitors for release in 2024 at the very earliest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn November last year, a report from Display Supply Chain Consultants' Ross Young claimed that the new monitor will likely feature the same quantum-dot display technology <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/m4-macbook-pro-quantum-dot/\">adopted by the latest MacBook Pro models</a>. Young said the latest quantum-dot display films have equal to better color gamut support, and offer improved motion performance, compared to the KSF phosphor film that he said Apple uses for the existing Pro Display XDR and previous <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> models. This means the Pro Display XDR 2 could have improved color accuracy and faster response times compared to the current model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost recently, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/pro-display-xdr-2-and-larger-imac-rumors/\">Gurman said</a> a new Pro Display XDR is currently \"less of a priority for Apple\" as an expensive, niche product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been no further mentions of the device since then and there still have been no reports at all about when it could be released. Perhaps we'll hear more about the second-generation Pro Display XDR later this year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pro-display-xdr/\">Pro Display XDR</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/pro-display-xdr-2-rumors/\">Apple Pro Display XDR 2 Rumors: Everything We Know</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pro-display-xdr-2-rumors-everything-we-know.2450227/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b0caac14888846369c6f99775599b6dbf905d3f605c3cd8dc30c4294e36bac30","category":"Apple"}
