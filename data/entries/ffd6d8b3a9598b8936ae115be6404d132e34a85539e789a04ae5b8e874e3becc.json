We are already seeing some great <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/best-black-friday-apple-deals.html\">discounts on Apple products</a> from various Apple resellers, but the real sales don’t start until late Thanksgiving and they run all the way through to Cyber Monday (November 27). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a deal on a new Apple product you may be wondering whether to wait for Apple’s Black Friday sale, or to take advantage of a deal from elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We find the best deals are from resellers rather than Apple itself, and we track them all so we can help you find the best deals on Apple products including the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1376743/best-black-friday-apple-watch-deals.html\">Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/best-black-friday-macbook-deals.html\">MacBooks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-black-friday-iphone-deals.html\">iPhones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1377158/best-black-friday-airpods-deals.html\">AirPods</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/best-black-friday-ipad-deals.html\">iPads</a>. You can peruse our individual round-ups of the best deals for Black Friday to find a bargain. We also monitor deals all year round, showcasing the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541154/apple-deals.html\">best Apple deals every month.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what of Apple? Will Apple hold a Black Friday sale in 2023? <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1382296/different-think-apple-black-friday-sale.html\">We wish they would</a>, but unfortunately, Apple’s Black Friday deal is – as usual – a giveaway of gift cards with certain purchases. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2023: Will Apple have a sale?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual in 2023 Apple will be giving customers Apple Gift Cards with the purchase of eligible Apple products. While the qualifying products and voucher amounts change every year, this is Apple’s only deal – Apple doesn’t discount its own products for Black Friday or Cyber Monday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Details of Apple’s Black Friday Shopping Event can be found on <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-672787-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s website</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Apple’s Black Friday deal in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Apple has announced its Black Friday 2023 deal we can confirm it is offering the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$50/£50 Apple Gift Card</strong>:, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple TV, HomePod, Beats Studio Pro, Beats Solo3 Wireless, Powerbeats Pro, Beats Fit Pro, Beats Studio Buds +, Beats Studio Buds, Beats Flex, Magic Keyboard, Magic Keyboard Folio, Apple Pencil (2nd-gen), Smart Keyboard Folio. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$75/£75 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPhone 14, iPhone SE, iPhone 13, AirPods (2nd-gen), AirPods (3rd-gen), AirPods Pro (2nd-gen), AirPods Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$100/£100 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad 10th gen, iPad Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$200/£200 Apple Gift Card</strong>: MacBook Air, Mac mini</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the iPhone 15, M3 iMac and M3-series MacBook Pro are all recent introductions Apple isn’t offering any vouchers with those purchases. But the company is offering vouchers with the new Apple Watch 9.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Black Friday 2023 Apple\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How good is Apple’s 2023 Black Friday deal? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 deal might not look as good as that of 2022 when Apple offered up to $250/£250 in Apple Gift Card with the MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch. This year the biggest voucher is $200/£200 and only the MacBook Air is offered – you can;t get the MacBook Pro or iMac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that this year the newest Apple Watch Series 9 is included and Apple is giving greater value in vouchers for nearly every product being offered: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Product</td><td><strong>2023</strong></td><td><strong>2022</strong></td></tr><tr><td>AirPods</td><td>$75/£75</td><td>$25/£25</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch</td><td>$50/£50</td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td>HomePod</td><td>$50/£50</td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone</td><td>$50/£50</td><td>$50/£50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPads</strong></td><td>$100/£100</td><td>£30/$30</td></tr><tr><td>Macs</td><td>$200/£200</td><td>$250/£250</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2022’s deal actually went a little further than Apple’s 2021’s Black Friday offer. Although that depends on your perspective – you could also think that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1383475/apples-black-friday-shopping-event-is-somehow-worse-this-year.html\">Apple’s Black Friday shopping event was worse in 2022</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 the biggest Apple Gift Card on offer was for $200/£160, which was the saving offered with the sale of the 27-inch iMac (which was discontinued in 2022). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the discounts on offer were generally a bit better than 2021, Apple didn’t match the offers from other resellers such as Amazon. You can see some of the best offers we saw for Black Friday 2022 below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2023: Best deals for Apple products </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/best-black-friday-apple-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 Apple deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/best-black-friday-macbook-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 MacBook deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373696/best-black-friday-mac-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 Mac Deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1377158/best-black-friday-airpods-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 AirPods deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1376743/best-black-friday-apple-watch-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 Apple Watch deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/best-black-friday-ipad-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 iPad deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-black-friday-iphone-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 iPhone deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1379636/best-apple-tv-black-friday-deals-2022.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 Apple TV deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375200/best-black-friday-mac-monitor-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 Mac monitor deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373771/best-black-friday-mac-ssd-deals.html\">Best Black Friday 2023 SSD and external hard drive deals</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2023: When do the sales begin?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Friday officially begins at 12.01am on the day after Thanksgiving, which in 2023 will be Friday November 24. However, many sales begin well before that, in 2022 we saw deals starting at the beginning of November. The main event runs through the weekend and concludes on Cyber Monday – which is November 27 in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2023: What Apple products will be on sale?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter which Apple product you’re looking for, you’ll be sure to find it on sale during Black Friday weekend. But there are a few caveats. We don’t expect to see huge deals on the newest Apple products – so you are unlikely to find huge discounts on the latest Apple Watches, Macs and iPhones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But other products could reach all-time low prices. In 2022 we saw the price of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro drop by $400, but for Black Friday/Cyber Monday we even saw $500 off at Amazon. We are already seeing some decent savings on the newest Macs at <a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=277729&amp;a=1538920&amp;epi=1-1-672787-1-0-0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.krcs.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">KRCS</a> in the U.K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2023: Where to get the best deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotting a good Black Friday deal takes a bit of work but we’ll be doing most of it for you.

While Cyber Monday promises impressive deals, prices are usually lowest on Black Friday. Plus there’s always the risk that the Apple device you want sells out and you miss out on the great deal everyone else got.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What was Apple’s Black Friday deal in 2022?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the four-day shopping event for 2022 – which ran from Black Friday to Cyber Monday (November 25-28 2022) customers were able to ‘save’ as much as $250/£250 on a new Apple product thanks to the gift vouchers that Apple will be giving away. For example, you could purchase a new 14-inch MacBook Pro and use your $250/£250 voucher to get the AirPods Pro 2nd generation for ‘free’.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t offer vouchers with every product it sells. Notably absent from the 2022 lineup were new products such as the iPhone 14 series, Apple Watch 8 and Ultra, iPad 10th generation, and the 2022 iPad Pro models.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022 Apple offered gift cards with purchases of the following products:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$25/£25 Apple Gift Card</strong>: AirPods 3rd generation with Lightning case, MagSafe Duo Charger, Apple Pencil 2nd Generation, Smart Folio Keyboard</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$30/£30 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPad 9th Gen</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$50/£50 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone SE, iPhone 12, iPad mini, iPad Air, Apple Watch SE, AirPods Pro 2nd Gen, Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$75/£75 Apple Gift Card</strong>: AirPods Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$100/£100 Apple Gift Card</strong>: Mac mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$150/£150 Apple Gift Card</strong>: M1 MacBook Air, M2 MacBook Air, iMac 24-inch</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$200/£200 Apple Gift Card</strong>: M2 MacBook Pro 13-inch</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$250/£250 Apple Gift Card</strong>: MacBook Pro 14-inch, MacBook Pro 16-inch</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also get vouchers with Beats products: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$50</strong>/<strong>£50 Apple Gift Card</strong>: Studio3 Wireless, Solo3 Wireless, Powerbeats Pro, Fit Pro, Studio Buds </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$25/£25 Apple Gift Card</strong>: Beats Flex</li>\n</ul>\n\nApple Inc, Apple Watch, iPad, iPhone, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ffd6d8b3a9598b8936ae115be6404d132e34a85539e789a04ae5b8e874e3becc","category":"Apple"}
