Apple has redesigned the login screen so that you enter your password at the bottom rather than the middle of the screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explain how to navigate the new Lock Screen and set your preferences here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1981602/macos-sonoma-lock-screen-settigns-clock-user-accounts.html\">How to customize and navigate the new login screen.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Desktop widgets </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be able to add more Widgets from the Widget Gallery and place them anywhere on the screen. Apple has gone to lengths to make sure they aren’t distracting, they will essentially fade into the background.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will also be able to add Widgets from an iPhone using Continuity, the iPhone just needs to be nearby, on or same Wi-Fi network.

See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2048287/macos-sonoma-cityscape-underwater-earth-animated-wallpapers.html\">The best wallpapers included in macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Personal Voice </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Personal Voice feature allows you to train your Mac to talk with your voice and then use that to convert text to speech. We explain how to use it here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2050750/how-to-make-your-mac-talk-like-you-macos-sonoma.html\">macOS Sonoma: How to train your Mac to talk in your voice</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Game Mode </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This new mode ensures that games get the highest priority on GPU and CPU, which should help with playability. It will make <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670440/best-mac-for-gaming.html\">gaming on Mac</a> “more immersive,” according to Apple. Other changes should reduce latency with controllers and improve in-game responsiveness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced that more Mac games are coming, and demonstrated “Death Stranding: Directors Cut” (which is unfortunately not a new game). Apple also explained how it will help game developers bring their games to the Mac with a new Game Porting kit that includes tools that devs can use to quickly port their games to the Mac, significantly reducing the game development time. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1945978/game-porting-toolkit-gaming-mac-valve-proton.html\">Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit is the first real step to fixing Mac gaming.</a> We also explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1993906/how-to-game-mode-macos-14-sonoma.html\">How to use Game Mode to boost performance.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\">Best games for Mac.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Video conferencing</h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"macOS Sonoma Meeting presentation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>You will appear in front of your presentation.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sonoma Meeting presentation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>You will appear in front of your presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sonoma Meeting presentation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>You will appear in front of your presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When you share your screen during a presentation your presence can get lost. To fix this issue Apple has devised a new video effect called Presenter Overlay that will overlay your face over the presentation, separating you from the background. This can appear like the picture above, or be a smaller bubble with your face in (which may cover less of the presentation).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features include the ability to add a reaction to your video to show how you feel about something. For example, if you show two thumbs up a fireworks animation will play. These features can also be used as video effects with other video conferencing apps, so it’s not tied to FaceTime. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You will be able to create Safari Profiles so you can separate accounts between work and home/school profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Safari and WebKit gain new typography. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will be able to block private browsing windows when they aren’t being used. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be possible to share Passkeys and Passwords with family members. This will be end-to-end encrypted via <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1510096/keychain-mac-iphone-ipad-icloud.html\">iCloud Keychain</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2012427/safari-17-features-web-apps-profiles-private-favorites-widget-extensions.html\">Safari 17: All the new features coming to your Mac this fall</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Web apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be easy to make a website you use a lot into a Web App. Just open the webpage and choose File &gt; Add to Dock to add a webpage to the Dock as an icon and open it to get an app-like appearance for that web page that opens outside of Safari.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1984619/macos-sonoma-how-to-web-apps.html\">Learn how to make and manage Web Apps in macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PDFs and Notes </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The AutoFill for PDFs feature arrived with macOS 14.2 in December 2023. It works with Contacts to select the information needed and makes it easy to fill out PDFs faster and securely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will also be able to view PDFs in Notes, link related notes, and open a Note in Pages to update it there. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Web Apps in macOS Sonoma\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Web Apps in macOS Sonoma\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Web Apps in macOS Sonoma\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Apps-Sonoma.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keyboard </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes to the keyboard include improved Autocorrect accuracy and inline typing predictions. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Messages </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect improved Search of the Messages app, being able to refine your search as you go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a new Sticker drawer, catchup for group conversations, and improvements to Messages in iCloud. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be warnings about potentially sensitive videos and photos before you open them, and as of macOS 14.2 warnings about Stickers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Security</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Improvements to Lockdown Mode will help protect against cyber attacks. Lockdown Mode makes it easy to protect your Apple devices and your data if you are the victim of a cyberattack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In macOS Sonoma Apple simplified the use of 2FA on websites. Safari will automatically fill in the code you are sent (as a text or email) and automatically delete the email or text afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another security-related feature in Sonoma is a simplification of the process for sharing passwords with friends and family. Users can create a group and share a set of passwords to that group. It’s end-to-end encrypted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Safari you can set a new Private Browsing Lock to appear on the screen to stop onlookers from viewing your screen when you aren’t present.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cb5570e4787baa4d1a71519ac07931982e4cc3fc71d849cf5162317f4e5cb682","category":"Apple"}
