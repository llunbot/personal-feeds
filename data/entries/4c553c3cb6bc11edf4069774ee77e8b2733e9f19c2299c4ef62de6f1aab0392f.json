And today we’ve got a fantastic deal on AirPods 4. Right now, you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z\">get a pair of AirPods 4 for their very best price of $99</a>, a $30 discount and matching their all-time-low price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s new AirPods 4 are a serious upgrade over the previous model at an even lower price. The new design ensures a better fit for most people, and the handy battery case gives you more than a full day of listening. When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">reviewed the AirPods 4</a>, we gave them a 4.5-star review and really appreciated the clarity and volume when listening to music and podcasts, and the fantastic battery life. Our version had active noise cancellation, but the two models are otherwise identical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you want those noise-cancelling buds, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1\">AirPods 4 with ANC are also on sale for $149</a> right now ($30 off), as well as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2766134/the-amazing-airpods-pro-2-just-hit-the-lowest-price-of-2025.html\">the AirPods Pro 2, which are $80 off</a> and down to just $169. The best value, however, is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z\">AirPods 4 for $99</a>, one of the best earbuds you can buy for under $100. So go grab a pair before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the AirPods 4 for their best price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4c553c3cb6bc11edf4069774ee77e8b2733e9f19c2299c4ef62de6f1aab0392f","category":"Apple"}
