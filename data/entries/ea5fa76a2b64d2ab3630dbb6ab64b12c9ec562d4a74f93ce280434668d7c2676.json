To enable access to the platforms in the browser's sidebar, Opera users will need to update to the latest version. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter that, click the three dots menu at the bottom of the sidebar to open the Sidebar Setup Menu. Discord, Slack, and Bluesky can be found under the Messengers category. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOpera One uses a modular design designed to adapt to the user's needs. It features Tab Islands, which automatically group related tabs for organized multitasking, and integrates Aria â€“ Opera's native AI assistant powered by ChatGPT, providing real-time web information and content generation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOpera One also includes a built-in ad blocker, free VPN, and customizable dynamic themes with immersive animations and soundscapes. The latest Opera One update adds two new themes: Interstellar and Metamorphic.
