While new Macs are usually released toward the end of the year, this is the first time a launch month has been singled out for the upcoming M4 Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis does not discount the possibility of Apple holding an event in October to announce the new machines. Last year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/\">announced</a> its \"Scary Fast\" event on Tuesday, October 23. It hosted the event on Monday, October 30, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/\">unveiling</a> new MacBook Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> models with M3 chips. These new machines then launched on Tuesday, November 7, so we could see a similar series of events this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors suggest that Apple has plans to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/these-new-macs-are-coming-in-2024/\">four new Mac models with M4-series chips before the end of the year</a>: an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, a new ‌iMac‌ with the M4 chip, and a completely <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/\">redesigned Mac mini</a> with the M4 and M4 Pro chips. With the exception of the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, these devices are expected to be minor refreshes that focus on chip upgrades, but they could come with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/\">16GB of memory as standard</a> across the board for the first time. Some of these machines are now <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/macbook-pro-m4-pro-m4-max-production-report/\">believed to be in mass production</a>, which may line up with a November release date.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-imac/\">M4 iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/\">M4 MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/apple-likely-to-launch-m4-macs-in-november/\">Apple Likely to Launch M4 Macs in November</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-launch-m4-macs-in-november.2434864/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d54acdc6a482190f7cf064b26d70af8a00fae13e830bc48995e9302669a2ede1","category":"Apple"}
