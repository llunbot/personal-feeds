That evidence includes the presence of a symbolically carved boulder in a prominent placement, and well as the remains of what may have been torches used to light the interior. And the acoustics would have been conducive to communal gatherings.</p>\n<p>Dating back to the Early Upper Paleolithic period, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manot_Cave\">Manot Cave</a> was found accidentally when a bulldozer broke open its roof during construction in 2008.
