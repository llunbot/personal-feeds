They’re drawing outdoor air over coils of refrigerant, harvesting warmth from that air. All air-source heat pumps do this—and they can glean heat <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/myth-heat-pumps-cold-weather-freezing-subzero/\">even on cold days</a>. But this heat pump is special. It is one of the most efficient installations of its kind in the country.</p>\n<p>“I’m number two on there,” fizzes owner Rob Ritchie, a retired chemistry teacher, referring to the system’s position <a href=\"https://heatpumpmonitor.org/#mode=topofthescops\" target=\"_blank\">on HeatPumpMonitor.org</a>, a kind of online leaderboard for heat pumps around the UK and beyond. “I should say it isn’t important—but it is. It’s nice being there.” </p><div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\" /></div>\n<p>At the time of writing, real-time data suggests that for every kilowatt-hour of electricity Ritchie’s heat pump consumes, it delivers 5.5 kilowatt-hours of heat—a coefficient of performance, or COP, of 5.5. Achieving a COP of 5 or above is “absolutely incredible,” says Emma-Louise Bennett, active transition support lead at <a href=\"https://www.viessmann.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Viessmann</a>, the company that made Ritchie’s heat pump. In the UK, average heat pump COPs <a href=\"https://housingevidence.ac.uk/the-great-heat-pump-mystery-wheres-the-cop/\" target=\"_blank\">tend to be between 2 and 3</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035177#p3\">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"88f3f2bb445c9c7f480c6cde8904a9cbfe8d29f8f38ebe89c2f2bf27c8587613","category":"Tech"}
