I wonder what his creative mind would make of the smartphones and weather apps we’re consulting now. It’s two weeks until the summer solstice yet a highly unusual Arctic airflow has forced Britain to put the heating on.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Dumfries\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Here at the foot of the Lowther Hills in Scotland it’s 10°C, but 600 metres above us, where we are heading, it’s below zero. Our jersey pockets bulge with extra layers, warmers and gloves. We can see our goal on the crest of a distant hill – a white, spherical structure known locally as ‘The Golf Ball’. It’s shimmering in a pool of sunlight that our apps inform us will last only until midday, at which point a weather front from the west will move in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>High society</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Scotland’s highest paved road isn’t in the Highlands but is here in Dumfries and Galloway, less than an hour’s drive from the border with England. It’s not as well-known as the tourist routes that traverse the mountains further north, largely because it’s closed to motorised traffic. But first we have to ride up to Scotland’s highest village, Wanlockhead, via the beautiful, natural corridor that is the Mennock Pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After the shock of its introductory steep ramps, the road levels off in a wide valley flanked by slopes that, in late summer, are ablaze with purple heather but for now are a carpet of iridescent green punctuated by the occasional ‘O’ of a circular drystone sheepfold. The only blemishes are the motorhomes and caravans sporadically parked up on the wide grass verge. The occupants of these, Warren says, are usually drawn here by the lure of a precious and shiny metal glittering at the bottom of the valley streams. Sure enough, we spot a couple knee-deep in water and shaking sieves.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Dumfries\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Panning for gold here dates back to the 16th century when it was used in the minting of coins during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. Nuggets peppered these hillsides like cow pats. Flakes of gold – and the occasional nugget – still turn up, although you need a licence to go prospecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road continues climbing even as we pass the sign welcoming us to the ‘Highest Village in Scotland’ and it’s several hundred more metres before we reach the turn-off to the private road, open to walkers and cyclists only, that will take us to the summit. We’ve climbed 300 vertical metres and are only halfway there.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Dumfries\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This private road is a 6km ribbon of bliss. With the exception of a couple of short sections, it’s well-surfaced tarmac that snakes lazily between the Lowther Hills to the dual radio masts that mark the highest peak, Green Lowther, at 732m. Once the village has slipped out of sight all we can see is an endless vista of whale-backed ridges being swept by fast-moving shadows of clouds. With no other traffic to distract us, it feels like a cyclist’s nirvana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 4km, the steepest ramp delivers us to ‘The Golf Ball’, a radar station that’s part of Britain’s air traffic control network. From here, the road continues straight as an arrow to the radio masts on the next hill. We arrive at the same time as the storm we’ve been racing.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Dumfries\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In between struggling to put on my rainproof jacket – my fourth layer of the day – I spot a door that is slightly ajar in a brick building beneath one of the masts.

We wave him in our direction and he dumps his ageing mountain bike against the wall before joining us and introducing himself as 72-year-old John Moore. He’s driven the 60 miles from Selkirk to Wanlockhead after hearing this was Scotland’s highest road.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Dumfries\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/uk-ride-scotland-158-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Andy McCandlish</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I’m ticking off all the big climbs,’ he says. ‘I did the Bealach na Bà a few weeks ago.

Most of it is through forest, all of it is steep, but the summit offers an unforgettable panorama of mountains and lochs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kenmore Hill</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Distance 5km. Elevation 412m. Av gradient 8%. Max gradient 16.8%</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A fierce climb on a narrow lane from the village of Kenmore at the eastern end of Loch Tay that delivers you into the beautiful, remote Glen Quaich. It gets easier about halfway up, trust us (although it’s all relative).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cairn o’ Mount</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Distance 3.3km. Elevation 313m. Av gradient 9.8%. Max gradient 16.6%</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a Caledonian Ventoux, this giant rises in solitary splendour from the nearby Grampian mountains just north of the Aberdeenshire village of Fettercairn. The ‘16%’ warning sign at the start sets the tone. There is a kilometre of false flat in the middle before the hurt resumes. Featured in the 2021 Tour of Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maovally</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Distance 5km. Elevation 320m. Av gradient 6.5%. Max gradient 10.7%</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A private road (open to walkers and cyclists) that services two power stations at the northern tip of Loch Shin in Sutherland, this is as beautiful and remote as it gets. The road is a dead end, unless you’ve got a gravel bike in which case it’s possible to make a loop via the stunning Glen Cassley.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Craigowl Hill</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Distance 3.5km. Elevation 318m. Av gradient 8.5%. Max gradient 22.8%</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Another private road, this monster lurks a few clicks north of Dundee. Don’t be deceived by how gentle its long, opening straight looks – you’ll be empty (but elated) by the time you scale the summit overlooking Dundee and the River Tay.
