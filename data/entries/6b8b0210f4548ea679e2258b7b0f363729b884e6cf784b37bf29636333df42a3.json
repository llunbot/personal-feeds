The Polestar 3 SUV has finally gone into production, and the automaker says deliveries to US customers should start in the second quarter of this year. That's a little behind schedule—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/the-polestar-3-suv-will-cost-83900-loaded-goes-on-sale-q4-2023/\">in October 2022, we were told</a> that the Polestar 3 would go on sale here toward the end of 2023.</p>\n<p>There's just one powertrain at launch, the Polestar 3 long-range dual motor, which starts at $73,400. This offers 489 hp (365 kW) and 620 lb-ft (840 Nm), which should give the EV a range of about 315 miles (507 km) from its 111 kWh battery pack. And Polestar is making the Pilot Pack standard equipment, which includes a head-up display and some advanced driver assistance systems.</p>\n<p>There will also be the Polestar 3 with the Plus Pack, for $78,900. This adds different 21-inch wheels, an upgraded interior with either \"MicroTech\" fabric or wool covering the seats, heated rear seats to go with the heated front seats, and an upgraded Bowers and Wilkins sound system with 25 speakers and a subwoofer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009787#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009787&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
