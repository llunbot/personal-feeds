Examples of current games include Word Jungle, Condor — Leap of Faith, Solitaire, Mahjong, and Charades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInitially, access to the store will be restricted to users with invitation-only access codes, but Aptoide says it has a waiting list of 20,000 signups and plans to issue between 500 to 1,000 codes per day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171037/aptoide-ios-game-store-eu-third-party-app-dma\">The Verge</a></em>, Aptoide is the first third-party iOS marketplace to launch with an Apple-approved in-app purchases (IAP) solution, which it will provide to developers via an IAP software development kit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's 50 euro cents Core Technology Fee (CFT) will be covered by a fee charged to developers for in-app purchases, which means IAP-driven apps will be \"preferred\" in Aptoide iOS, according to the marketplace's CEO, Paulo Trezentos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApps distributed through alternative app marketplaces are required to submit to a notarization process to ensure they are free from malware, but Apple does not have restrictions on content so apps that might not have been eligible for the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>‌ can be distributed through alternative means. Alternative app marketplaces are not available outside of the European Union.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAptoide has operated for an Android ‌App Store‌ since 2009, and last year reached nearly half a billion downloads.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/04/aptoide-marketplace-games-ios/\">Aptoide Launching Alternative iOS Game Marketplace in EU</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/aptoide-launching-alternative-ios-game-marketplace-in-eu.2428114/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"930e9ba35f0303ced37e33e5866f27c783b43127138591b104e3f5ec01619fff","category":"Apple"}
