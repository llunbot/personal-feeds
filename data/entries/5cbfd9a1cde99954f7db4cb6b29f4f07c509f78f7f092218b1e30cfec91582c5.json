Winter can be a lonely time, with the cold, wet and dark putting many off venturing outdoors. Luckily Rouvy can help – in two ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the Rouvy indoor cycling app allows you to travel around the globe and ride some of the world’s most iconic cycling routes. It’s not a gamified version of cycling – these routes use immersive high-quality video with augmented reality to bring you as close as possible to roads you’ve dreamed of riding or routes you want to revisit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s simple to set up and use. All you need to do is link the app to your device: a monitor, phone, tablet or Apple TV, as Rouvy runs on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android devices. Then connect it to a smart bike or direct-drive, wheel-on trainer, and ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the joy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, you can now get an even better deal by sharing both the experience and the cost with friends, because Rouvy now also offers two new subscriptions: Duo and Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duo, as the name would suggest, is for two riders, while Group is for up to five – and those five don’t have to be from the same household. Whichever option works for you, riders in the same house, group of friends, club or team can ride and train together, on any of Rouvy’s stunning routes, without leaving home.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While the individual subscription price remains unchanged at 14.99 EUR/USD (or equivalent other currency, based on exchange rate), the new Duo package is priced at 19.99 EUR/USD, offering a total saving of 33% over the combined individual cost for two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Group subscription package for up to five riders costs 32.99 EUR/USD, offering a saving of more than 55% over the individual cost for five – or a cost per person of less than 7 USD/EUR if split equally. There simply isn’t a more cost-effective way of riding around the world with your friends or loved ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Delve deeper</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do you get for money? For starters, Rouvy allows you to explore loads of famous cycling routes. You can test yourself on stages from the three Grand Tours – the Giro d’Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España – to get a feel for what it’s like to be a professional cyclist, and beyond that Rouvy currently offers more than 700 augmented reality routes, covering more than 15,000km, from every corner of the globe.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>You can ride California’s Pacific Coast Highway, explore the wilds of South Africa’s Kruger National Park or see the sights in iconic cities including Paris, Vienna, London, Rome and Sydney. Or if you want to get out of town, there is a growing number of gravel routes on which to hone your off-road skills. You can experience the thrill of technical terrain from your own home – and no one, apart from perhaps your partner, cares what you wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Training, racing and more</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use Rouvy for sightseeing if you choose, but it also goes much deeper than that. Rouvy offers structured workouts from an extensive library and you can access training plans from TrainingPeaks. There’s a five-week training plan for beginners, and the app even offers real-time feedback on your ride effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rouvy also includes Strava Live Segments to increase your connection with the outdoor world via Rouvy’s Just Ride mode. And, whatever your current level of fitness, Rouvy allows you to set realistic goals, track your progress and challenge yourself against others and your own personal records.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/rouvy-bf-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Rouvy even offers a Career mode, which allows you to measure your progress by gaining Experience and by collecting Coins. You earn Experience points for every pedal stroke – indoor, outdoor, races, training rides and even your warm-up and cooldown – and when you level up you will receive a new on-screen badge and prizes from Rouvy’s partners. You also receive Coins every time you complete a route, and these can be used to customise your avatar’s bike frame. You can match up with your Duo or Group partners, or go it alone – it’s up to you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get more money off!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One last thing: in a special Black Friday offer you can use the code <strong>CYCLISTBF</strong> to get <strong>25 per cent off</strong> any annual plan between 17th and 26th November 2023.
