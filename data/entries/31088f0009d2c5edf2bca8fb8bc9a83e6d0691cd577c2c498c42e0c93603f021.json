{"title":"‘iOS 17.2 Hints at Sideloading Apps From Outside the App Store’","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/10/ios-17-2-sideload-apps/","date":1699652652000,"content":"\n<p>Filipe Espósito, with a nice scoop for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By analyzing the new API, we’ve learned that it has an extension \nendpoint declared in the system, which means that other apps can \ncreate extensions of this type. Digging even further, we found a \nnew, unused entitlement that will give third-party apps permission \nto install other apps. In other words, this would allow developers \nto create their own app stores. </p>\n\n<p>The API has basic controls for downloading, installing, and even \nupdating apps from external sources. It can also check whether an \napp is compatible with a specific device or iOS version, which the \nApp Store already does. Again, this could easily be used to \nmodernize MDM solutions, but here’s another thing. </p>\n\n<p>We also found references to a region lock in this API, which \nsuggests that Apple could restrict it to specific countries. This \nwouldn’t make sense for MDM solutions, but it does make sense for \nenabling sideloading in particular countries only when required by \nauthorities — such as in the European Union. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Makes sense. If Apple winds up being forced to allow sideloading in the E.U., I think they will <em>only</em> allow it in the E.U. Apple still has a pending appeal, but I doubt they’ll win, and the deadline for compliance is March of next year, which probably means iOS 17.3 or 17.4.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/10/ios-17-sideloading\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"31088f0009d2c5edf2bca8fb8bc9a83e6d0691cd577c2c498c42e0c93603f021","category":"Tech"}
