{"title":"Introducing new PartyRock capabilities and free daily usage","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-new-partyrock-capabilities-and-free-daily-usage/","date":1733086143000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://partyrock.aws/\">PartyRock</a> is an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> playground that anyone can use to create <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/\">generative AI</a>-powered applications by simply describing the app you want to build without the need to write any code.</p> \n<p>Since <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/build-ai-apps-with-partyrock-and-amazon-bedrock/\">its launch in November 2023</a>, over half a million apps have been built by users worldwide. These apps range from simple text generators to sophisticated productivity tools that combine multiple AI capabilities.</p> \n<p>Throughout this year, we observed that as PartyRock users build skills and intuition by using the playground, they find interesting and useful ways to build apps for improving their daily lives. PartyRock apps increased their individual productivity, and they returned to PartyRock to use them regularly.</p> \n<p>Today, we’re introducing improvements meeting the most requested customer needs:</p> \n<p><strong>Free daily usage</strong> – Previously, PartyRock offered a free trial period for a limited time. Starting in 2025, all users will have a recurring free daily usage granted, with no credit card required.</p> \n<p><strong>Search the app catalog</strong> – You can now explore hundreds of thousands of apps in the PartyRock catalog and find the right app for your use case by category or functionality. Relevant and popular apps are highlighted to showcase the creativity of the community. Results include app previews and last modified date to help you pick what’s best for you.</p> \n<p><strong>Do more with docs</strong> – You can upload and process multiple documents simultaneously, making it easier to build apps that handle batch processing, document comparison, or content aggregation.</p> \n<p>Let’s see these some new features in action.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Searching and remixing a PartyRock app<br /> </strong></span>I open <a href=\"https://partyrock.aws/\">PartyRock</a> and sign in with my social credentials. In the <strong>Home</strong> section, I can use the search box to look for apps for a specific use case. I love traveling, and I’d like to improve the way I share my trips with family and friends. I enter <code>travel</code> and <code>vlog</code> in the search box. In the search results, I see an app that gets my attention.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/partyrock-search-apps-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/partyrock-search-apps-2.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"1593\" height=\"950\" /></a></p> \n<p>I choose the <strong>Travel vlog script writer</strong> app and open it in a browser tab. The app generates a travel log script starting from a few inputs: the destination, the itinerary, and the tone.</p> \n<p>I like to prepare some travel notes before a trip so that I know what the options are and what I want to visit. What if I can upload my notes and other documents to better personalize the vlog?</p> \n<p>One of the key capabilities of PartyRock is that I can start with an existing app and “remix” it to tailor it to my needs. The resulting app can then be shared for others to use.</p> \n<p>I choose <strong>Remix</strong> and then <strong>Edit</strong> to customize this app. I add a <strong>Document</strong> widget and edit it:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>For <strong>Widget title</strong>, I use <code>Notes</code>.</li> \n <li>For <strong>Instruction</strong>, I enter <code>Upload your notes and documents with travel tips</code>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>I save the new widget and move just after the other input fields.</p> \n<p>To use these images in the app, I edit the <strong>Your Vlog script</strong> widget. I want the script to include the content of those images. In the prompt generating the script, I add a sentence to analyze and consider the image of the destination:</p> \n<p><code>Get inspiration from what you see in @Notes.</code></p> \n<p>I also update the <strong>Vlog cover</strong> widget prompt to consider the whole script when generating the cover image:</p> \n<p><code>A portrait of a trip to @Destination considering the @Your Vlog script.</code></p> \n<p>I save and leave edit. The remixed app is now ready to be tested.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Using the remixed PartyRock app<br /> </span></strong>Let’s try the customized version of the app. I enter:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>Rome, Italy</code> as <strong>Destination</strong></li> \n <li><code>A walk in the old city center</code> as <strong>Itinerary</strong></li> \n <li><code>Peaceful and relaxing</code> as <strong>Tone</strong>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Then, I upload my travel notes.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/partyrock-inputs.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/partyrock-inputs.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"1640\" height=\"993\" /></a></p> \n<p>I choose the <strong>Play</strong> button to start the app. The app takes a few seconds to generate its output.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/partyrock-outputs-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/partyrock-outputs-1.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"1596\" height=\"638\" /></a></p> \n<p>I like the result. The script is quite detailed, and the image cover a nice addition. I can further extend the app to use the image cover in a social media post generator for posting about the vlog to different platforms with different tones and styles. The possibilities are endless!</p> \n<p><strong><span>Things to know<br /> </span></strong>PartyRock with these new capabilities is available at <a href=\"https://partyrock.aws\">https://partyrock.aws</a>.</p> \n<p>No credit card or AWS account is required to use PartyRock, and you can explore hundreds of thousands of published apps even without signing in.</p> \n<p>With PartyRock, everyone can become a builder.
