At Thursday's news conference, Liu \"reiterated\" those complaints, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/tsmc-s-second-fab-in-arizona-delayed-as-us-grants-remain-in-flux\">reported</a>, claiming that TSMC is still struggling to hire skilled workers in Arizona.</p>\n<p>According to Liu, TSMC's second Arizona plant—which is supposed to become the most advanced facility in the US—likely won't start volume production of advanced chips until 2027 or 2028. That's potentially two years longer than initial projections suggesting that production would start in 2026.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997084#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997084&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53b60bc6323757d0145abe95f023bb3c9443a20ce449ba6f5f3a06a740e9e542","category":"Tech"}
