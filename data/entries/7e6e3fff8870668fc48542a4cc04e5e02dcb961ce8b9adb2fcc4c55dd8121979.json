These upscalers can make errors, and they won't always look quite as good as a native-resolution image. But they're both nice alternatives to living with a blurry, non-native-resolution picture on an LCD or OLED display.</p>\n<p>FSR and DLSS are especially useful for older or cheaper 1080p or 1440p-capable GPUs that are connected to a 4K monitor, where you'd otherwise have to decide between a sharp 4K image and a playable frame rate; it's also useful for hitting higher frame rates at lower resolutions, which can be handy for high-refresh-rate gaming monitors.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e6e3fff8870668fc48542a4cc04e5e02dcb961ce8b9adb2fcc4c55dd8121979","category":"Tech"}
