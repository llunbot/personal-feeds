Apple's credit card can be managed completely through the Wallet app on the iPhone, with a physical version available for use at stores that do not accept contactless payments. The card has no fees beyond interest and offers up to 3% cashback known as Daily Cash.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Card's financial partner in the U.S. is currently Goldman Sachs, but that reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/\">might change in the next 12 to 15 months</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile there have been clues that the Apple Card might expand to additional countries in the future, such as an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/canada-approves-apple-card-apple-cash-trademarks/\">Apple Card trademark filing in Canada</a>, Apple has not confirmed any immediate plans to launch the card internationally.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Apple Card Savings</h3>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/\">Apple Card savings account</a> launched in the Wallet app on the iPhone, allowing Apple Card holders in the U.S. to earn interest on their Daily Cash and other cash deposits. The high-yield savings account has a 4.15% APY, with no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the Apple Card is available in the U.S. only, so too is the savings account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Cash</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Cash-banner.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/#apple_cash\">Apple Cash</a> is a Venmo-like payment feature that allows iPhone users in the U.S. to send, request, and receive money in the Wallet and Messages apps. Users can transfer their Apple Cash balance to a connected bank account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Cash remains available in the U.S. only, and despite clues like a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/canada-approves-apple-card-apple-cash-trademarks/\">trademark filing in Canada</a>, it is unclear if the feature will expand to other countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Pay Later</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Later-feature-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nLaunched earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/\">Apple Pay Later</a> is a \"buy now, pay later\" feature that lets qualifying U.S. residents split a purchase made with Apple Pay into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees. The feature is available for purchases between $75 and $1,000 made on an iPhone or iPad on most websites and apps that accept Apple Pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the other financial features on this list, it is unclear if or when Apple Pay Later will expand to other countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wallet IDs</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/apple-wallet-drivers-license-feature.jpg\" width=\"1698\" height=\"956\" />\r<br />\nIn 2022, Apple started letting residents of participating U.S. states add their driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app on the iPhone and Apple Watch, providing a convenient and contactless way to display proof of identity or age. The feature is currently available in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/23/apple-launches-ids-in-wallet-arizona/\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/colorado-ids-wallet-app-support/\">Colorado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/25/iphone-drivers-license-wallet-app-maryland/\">Maryland</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/iphone-drivers-license-georgia/\">Georgia</a> only, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/iphone-ids-coming-to-these-8-us-states/\">additional states to follow</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said it was working to offer the ID feature across the U.S. in the future, but the company has yet to announce any specific plans or a timeframe, and it has not indicated if the feature will ever launch in other countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Roadside Assistance via Satellite</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg\" width=\"1596\" height=\"897\" />\r<br />\nStarting with iOS 17, all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models offer a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-roadside-assistance-feature-tested/\">roadside assistance via satellite feature</a> that allows users in the U.S. to contact roadside assistance company AAA for vehicle service when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said the feature is available \"beginning\" in the U.S., so it will likely expand to some additional countries in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Clean Energy Charging</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/clean-energy-charging-ios-16-1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\niOS 16.1 introduced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/24/ios-16-1-clean-energy-charging-details/\">Clean Energy Charging feature</a> that \"aims to decrease the carbon footprint of the iPhone by optimizing charging times for when the grid is using cleaner energy sources,\" according to Apple. When the feature is toggled on, the iPhone will attempt to charge \"when lower carbon-emission electricity is available.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nClean Energy Charging is available in the U.S. only, and Apple has not indicated if or when it will be expanded to additional countries.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-features-in-us-only/\">These Seven iOS Features Remain Available in the U.S. Only</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-seven-ios-features-remain-available-in-the-u-s-only.2413635/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5b3f2059abf78773686a90ba95c5745e9d12fe09c6daec5129db481a3ea0593c","category":"Apple"}
