Apple says it is the world’s thinnest 15-inch laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also light weighing in at 3.3lbs. That’s more than the 13-inch MacBook Air (2.7lbs), and more than the 13-inch MacBook Pro (at 3lbs), but compared to the 14-inch MacBook Pro at 3.5lbs it’s a winner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple says that the MacBook Air is “40 percent thinner and half a pound lighter than a comparable PC laptop”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>15-inch MacBook Air spec</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-15-inch-MacBook-AIr.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"15-inch MacBook Air Spec\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-15-inch-MacBook-AIr.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-15-inch-MacBook-AIr.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-15-inch-MacBook-AIr.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-15-inch-MacBook-AIr.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the 13-inch model there is 500 nits brightness, a 1080p camera and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chip is still the M2. Battery life is the same 18 hours as the 13-inch MacBook AIr. That means it is still less than the 13-inch MacBook Pro claims 20 hours battery life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The display is, as mentioned above, 15.3-inches measured diagonally. The 13-inch M2 MacBook Air screen is 13.6-inches, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro screen is 13.3-inches. The 14-inch MacBook Pro screen is 14.2-inches diagonally. The screen is Liquid Retina, like the 13-inch Air and unlike the 13-inch Pro screen (which is just a plain old Retina). Brightness for all three is 500 nits though. There are more pixels, as you would expect, to the tune of 2880×1864 pixels. Apple claims that this is also twice the resolution and 25 percent brighter than a comparable PC laptop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FaceTime camera is 1080p, like the one in the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. The 720p camera in the MacBook Pro and the older M1 MacBook Air is poor in comparison. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The audio in the newer, larger MacBook Air is better than the smaller model. There are six speakers and force cancelling woofers, where the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air has just four speakers. So expect better sound from the 15-inch MacBook Air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are ports for MagSafe charging, two Thunderbolt ports (which can be used for connecting accessories and up to a 6K external display), and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6eb9ea915ad4fd54cfbdd9a2b61a0dbb93f3e571d8b17cfb3930df9be9df3474","category":"Apple"}
