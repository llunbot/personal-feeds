After investigating the problem further, Chevy recalled a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/chevrolet-issues-second-recall-to-prevent-bolt-ev-battery-fires/\">second batch in July</a>. The problem was traced to two manufacturing defects that could occur simultaneously. The defects—a torn anode tab and folded separator—created conditions that could lead to a short in affected cells. So far, the company has identified 10 fires that involve faulty batteries, according to an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-business-health-environment-and-nature-bbe51b0c8e644c4448d634fc3c0f3461\">AP</a> report.<span> </span></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/recall-all-chevy-bolt-vehicles-fire-risk\">third and latest recall</a> includes 73,000 Bolts made from 2019–2022, the current model year and brings the total recall to nearly 142,000 cars, with over 100,000 having been sold in the US. GM estimates that the initial recalls will cost $800 million, and it expects the new one to add $1 billion to the total. GM said it will be seeking reimbursement from LG.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789265#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789265&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"557bb5bc2e64c9ef465ab9d59c1289c2f62ee6cb21a55473d6346644a7266055","category":"Tech"}
