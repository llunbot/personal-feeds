Despite the feature launching with the iPhone 14 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/apples-satellite-emergency-service-launches-in-the-us-and-canada/\">in 2022</a>, Android manufacturers haven't been super receptive to copying the idea of satellite messaging. Qualcomm and satellite company Iridium built a working solution and incorporated it into Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, only for <em>zero</em> Android manufacturers to support the feature, leading to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/qualcomm-kills-its-copy-of-apples-satellite-sos-after-ten-months/\">the dissolution</a> of the partnership. If Google wants an Android satellite SMS phone to play with, it seems like it will need to build the device itself.</p>\n<p>Reliable leaker Kamila Wojciechowska over at <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-sos-satellite-connectivity-3433498/\">Android Authority</a> says Google is working on doing just that. It looks like the Pixel 9 will be getting emergency satellite SOS. Since the Pixel 6, Pixel phones have been the rare devices that don't use Qualcomm modems. Google partners with Samsung and bases its Pixel Tensor chips on Samsung Exynos chips, and that means using Samsung's (usually much maligned) modems, too. Citing a source, Wojciechowska says the Pixel 9 would use the new <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/news-events/tech-blog/exynos-modem-5400-1-worlds-first-11-2gbps-5g-speeds-with-only-fr1/\">Exynos Modem 5400,</a> along with its optional NTN (non-terrestrial network) capabilities, allowing the phone to be \"the first to support Android’s native satellite implementation.\" The initial service provider would be T-Mobile (just like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/10/android-g1-review/\">the good old days</a>).</p>\n<p>The move would make sense. The whole original point of the Nexus/Pixel line was to give Google something to build Android on. By incorporating the latest hardware features into the next Pixel, Android gets a target to program for and test on. Otherwise, we'd have a chicken-and-egg problem where no one makes the hardware because there's no software support, and no one makes software because there's no hardware to program for. Google just does it all at once.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017214#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017214&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c8c6624842bf9e5594373834c70e75f5572530011d7a579ac53ccf4126012c4","category":"Tech"}
