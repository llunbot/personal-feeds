We came into this interview with no agenda, but I asked him to have a story ready to start things off, and it turned out to be a great catalyst for talking about everything from why pros aren’t great at teaching amateurs, finding the motivation to ride or race, and some great life lessons about, well, life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"alexey vermeulen racing gravel on new custom painted enve mod gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alexey-vermeulen-gravel-racer-podcast-interview.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And, of course, we talk about Willie the Weiner Dog and why he started riding with his girlfriend’s dog in a backpack.
