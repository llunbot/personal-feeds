Rumors suggest that Apple's first folding ‌iPhone‌ could come out in 2026 or 2027, but by then, Samsung will be even further ahead in foldable device development.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/huawei-tri-fold-smartphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2594\" height=\"1458\" /><em>Huawei's tri-fold Mate XT Ultimate</em></div>\r<br />\nRight now, Samsung has the Galaxy Fold and the Galaxy Flip, which fold in different ways. The Galaxy Fold is larger and unfolds horizontally like a book, while the Flip has a vertical fold. According to rumors, Samsung is working on yet another foldable, this one with a tri-fold design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung's tri-fold device has been rumored for quite some time, and Samsung even teased it as a \"multi-fold\" device at its Unpacked event, but more information about the device came out this week. As noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_trifold_could_be_called_galaxy_g_fold-news-66351.php\">GSMArena</a></em>, it's looking like Samsung could call it the Galaxy G Fold, which would make it a new product line distinct from the current Z Fold models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe tri-fold smartphone is expected to fold out into a 10-inch screen, which would make it significantly better than the current Z Fold6 flagship foldable smartphone from Samsung. The Z Fold6 is 7.6 inches when it's opened up, while the Z Flip6 is 6.7 inches unfolded.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung won't have the first tri-fold smartphone on the market, because Huawei has already released the <a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/mate-xt-ultimate-design/\">Mate XT Ultimate</a>. You can't get Huawei's device in the United States, though, and it costs $2,800, so Samsung will be first to a tri-fold smartphone in markets outside of China.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung typically announces new foldable smartphones around July, and it's looking like we could see the tri-fold smartphone unveiled this year ahead of a launch in early 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf Samsung's tri-fold smartphone launches in early 2026, it will beat any Apple foldable to market, since the earliest we expect to see an Apple foldable is 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of 2024, Apple was supposedly working on a foldable ‌iPhone‌ with a design similar to the Galaxy Z Flip, which means a vertical fold. Such a device would likely be similar in size to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max, but with an option to fold it in half to make for a more compact size.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/samsung-tri-fold-smartphone/\">Samsung is Working on a Tri-Fold Smartphone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-is-working-on-a-tri-fold-smartphone.2448797/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fff45df8585f0c05175ece1d50ebb9c5db8c47ab94dab0b213671e1729b5450","category":"Apple"}
