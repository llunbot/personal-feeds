According to Readdle, it is able to mirror style, tone, and personality traits \"to a degree.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers can enable Spark AI in the Spark Settings, and from there, the app will select three samples of recently sent emails to analyze writing style. This style will then be applied to AI-generated emails and replies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAI-generated text can be edited and reviewed before it is sent, and there is an option to disable the feature for those who do not want to use it. Spark suggests that the tool is useful for journalists, content creators, researchers, academics, and professional teams.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReaddle recommends providing simple prompts to the AI to get the best results, such as \"write an intro email to Bob and suggest setting up a call at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com\">Spark's AI tool</a> uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI as its AI service provider, and it says that data is not used for model training nor stored for more than a month. Spark Premium is required to use the feature, with the Premium update priced at $7.99 per month or $59.99 per year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spark/\">Spark</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/spark-mail-ai-writing-assistant/\">Spark Mail Gets 'My Writing Style' AI Email Assistant</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spark-mail-gets-my-writing-style-ai-email-assistant.2420185/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"013f46ddc59db8dbb0c3e8484ab87761f008739d22c12659dccaf3fe690a7f65","category":"Apple"}
