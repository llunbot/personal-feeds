An almost-7 km section of Mountain Highway from The Basin to Sassafras in the Dandenong Ranges, better known as the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/374953?filter=overall\" target=\"_blank\">1 in 20</a> (an approximation of its gradient). The 1 in 20 is a popular testing ground for local road cyclists of all abilities. A time near the top of the Strava leaderboard puts you among some of the best climbers in the country.</p><p>This past Saturday morning, 19-year-old mountain biker turned roadie Liam Johnston set a <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6340229825\" target=\"_blank\">new Strava KOM on the 1 in 20</a>, taking the crown from pro racer <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/01/freddy-ovett-smashing-melbournes-1-20-record-sub-12-gettable/\" target=\"_blank\">Freddy Ovett</a> by a single second. His time? 12:19 for the most popular <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/374953?filter=overall\" target=\"_blank\">1 in 20 segment</a> – an average of 32.9 km/h. His average power output for that effort was a hefty 486 watts (<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/06/just-how-good-are-male-pro-road-cyclists/\" target=\"_blank\">6.35 W/kg</a>).</p><p>CyclingTips caught up with Johnston to talk about his record ride, which came as part of a group effort up the climb.</p><hr><p><strong>Matt de Neef: Congrats on the KOM! What was the plan with the ride? Did you go into it thinking you guys would have a crack at the KOM?</strong></p><p>Liam Johnston: No, I got a message from <a href=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/mark-o-brien\" target=\"_blank\">Mark [O’Brien]</a> the night before just saying that we were going to have a crack. So I went out and met them. There was like seven or eight of us. We didn’t have the KOM in mind; we were just going to do an attempt. And then, we took the KOM<em>.</em></p><p><strong>How did it play out on the climb?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/raphael-freienstein/2017\" target=\"_blank\">Raph Freinstein</a> led out for the first, I think, three or four minutes and then it was basically me, Marko, <a href=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/drew-morey\" target=\"_blank\">Drew [Morey]</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/nicholas-white2\" target=\"_blank\">Nick White</a> that swapped turns. And then with probably 2 km to go, it was only me, Drew and Mark, and then by the line, it was just me and Drew.</p><p><strong>I heard Drew had a GPS issue and that he got a bit unlucky?</strong></p><p>He got stitched up a bit. He started in my wheel and then I finished right on his wheel. And on Strava there’s two seconds difference. So I’m not really sure how that works.</p><p><strong>What were the conditions like?</strong></p><p>It wasn’t too windy. There was a bit of wind and it was a tailwind, but it wasn’t phenomenal. And it was raining at the top so that was a bit grim.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/smallMelbs_VV_2p6a2134-1340x893.jpeg\"><figcaption>The 1 in 20 climb in the Dandenongs, east of Melbourne.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>You must have felt pretty good out there.</strong></p><p>Yeah, I felt very fresh. I’ve been training a lot and I’d just come off a pretty solid week. As soon as I left home I was just feeling good.</p><p><strong>Were you keeping an eye on the time throughout the effort?</strong></p><p>I wasn’t looking at my GPS too much. I was sort of just trying to sit in the wheel and be as aero as possible and then when I pulled turns I’d justgo by feel, I guess.</p><p>On the climb itself there’s a mark [on the road] that says 1 km to go. And when we got to that point, I looked down and it was 10 minutes and 20 seconds and I was like “Right, it’s going to take two minutes if you go 30 km/h so we should be on here.” So that was the only time where I actually thought that we could be in the running to get the KOM. And I basically just hung on to the top and that was that.</p><p><strong>Did you see once you got to the top that you’d got the KOM?</strong></p><p>I lapped it and it was 12:20 [<em>the same time as Ovett’s KOM on the segment in question– ed.</em>] so we didn’t get our hopes up too much because I could have lapped it a bit later or earlier. Maybe not exactly at the line. But yeah we were pretty surprised, actually.</p><p><strong>What do you make of Freddy Ovett’s time? A lot of people reckon it must have been motorpaced. Now that you’ve taken the KOM in a group, do you reckon Freddy’s effort was motorpaced, or do you reckon he could have done it on his own?</strong></p><p>I have heard that argument before. The conditions could have been different. I don’t know how aero Freddy is, I’m not really sure how much he weighs, there could have been a tailwind. There’s just so many variables. He’s obviously a professional rider and he must be really, really good. I’m not going to just immediately say “Yeah, he motorpaced”.</p><p>It’s definitely plausible that he could have done it by himself. I looked at his file on Strava and he’s got his power and heart rate and and it all seems to match up. And it’s a similar watts-per-kilo to what I did on Saturday.</p><p><strong>What was your best time on the 1 in 20 before Saturday?</strong></p><p>I had a crack by myself a couple of months back just with the full training setup. I was actually just doing a training ride and then I noticed it was super windy. So I went down to The Basin and had a full crack up it and I got 13:10 I think, which just got me on the leaderboard.</p><p><strong>Do you reckon you could go faster in a group than you guys did on Saturday?</strong></p><p>There’s probably a few more stops we could have pulled out. We didn’t even leave our bottles or saddlebags at the bottom. I reckon if people ran race setups – race wheels, no bottles, no saddlebags, maybe a bit more wind …. As I think Freddy said before, I think sub-12 could be possible. Definitely not by yourself though, I reckon.</p><p><strong>For people who aren’t familiar with you and your riding, can you tell us a bit about yourself? You race MTB and road right?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I grew up on a mountain bike. I started racing on the national circuit when I was 13 which was great. We had a solid group of guys. As an under 15, we sort of just went around Australia. I progressed through U15s and U17s and in U19s, I started to get real serious. I got third at Nationals and I was able to go overseas to South Africa and Malaysia to do some Junior World Series races, which was really good.</p><p>And then I went to Canada for World Champs – I actually got selected for the Australian team, for U19s, and that’s the highest that I got in that side of the sport. And I was going to have another crack as a second-year U19 and try and go to Worlds again but then COVID happened. And then I just switched focus to road racing pretty much.</p><p><strong>What sort of races have you been doing since you switch to road?</strong></p><p>I <a href=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/liam-johnston\" target=\"_blank\">did Nationals this year</a>. It came off the back of not a whole lot of training, just because I wasn’t too familiar with the riding that I had to do to excel on the road.</p><p>I’ve since switched coachs a couple of months ago and we’re already seeing pretty big increases in just the power that I’m putting out, and my endurance. So I’m pretty keen to see how I go.</p><p><strong>What’s your plan for the Aussie summer and then moving into 2022?</strong></p><p>Look, not too sure at the moment. I’m definitely doing the time trial and road race at Nationals. But in terms of races after that, there’s just a bit to be confirmed. Yeah, hopefully I get some starts at races.</p></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6bdc9fdd2bca6774bd2a3a9456c54ec9bf4f03de6eada5d41682faf911ff2245","category":"Cycling"}
