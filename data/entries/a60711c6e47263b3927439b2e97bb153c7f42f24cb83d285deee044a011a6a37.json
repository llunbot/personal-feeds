Most of it is made from recycled synthetic fabrics and aimed at keeping out the cold while riding hard or casually about town.</p>\n<p>The brand will now offer a Pro Team Gore-Tex Rain Jacket, Pro Team Insulated Gore-Tex Rain Jacket, City Insulated Gore-Tex Field Coat, women’s Explore Down Jacket and limited-edition kit honouring the two-time Giro d’Italia winner Franco Balmamion.</p>\n<p>Rapha AW2021 winter range pricing:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Pro Team Gore-Tex Rain Jacket</strong> – £195/AU$340/€230/$270</li>\n<li><strong>Pro Team Insulated Gore-Tex Rain Jacke</strong>t – £260/AU$450/€310/$355</li>\n<li><strong>City Insulated Gore-Tex Field Coat –</strong> £495/AU$850/€590/$675</li>\n<li><strong>Explore Down Jacket –</strong> £220/AU$385/€260/$290</li>\n<li><strong>Balmamion range –</strong> from £15 to £180 (other currencies TBC)</li>\n</ul><h2>More Gore-Tex Pro Team jackets</h2>\n<p>Rapha’s Pro Team Gore-Tex pieces will be available from December and continue the brand’s relationship with Gore-Tex. The partnership started two years ago when Rapha used Gore-Tex’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gore-tex-shakedry-cycling-rain-jackets/\">Shakedry</a> fabric to create two jackets, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jackets-and-vests/rapha-pro-team-lightweight-gore-tex-shakedry-jacket-review/\">which have been well received</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Rapha Pro Team Gore-Tex Rain Jacket uses Gore-Tex’s waterproof Active fabric.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha</i></span></div>\n<p>The new designs are intended to build on that success, but forgo Shakedry in place of some other Gore-Tex materials that are still waterproof but a little more versatile.</p>\n<p>Gore-Tex Active is used to construct the Pro Team Gore-Tex Rain Jacket. Rapha says it is the lightest and most breathable three-layer waterproof fabric Gore produces, boasting waterproofing and breathability close to Shakedry.</p>\n<p>However, as Active has a face fabric (Shakedry leaves the Gore-Tex membrane exposed), Rapha says this should make the Rain Jacket more durable, as well as allowing it to be available in colours other than Shakedry’s bin-bag like dark grey.</p>\n<p>The Pro Team Insulated Gore-Tex Rain Jacket is more different from the uninsulated version than the name would suggest.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pro Team Insulated Gore-Tex jacket uses Gore’s Paclite Plus fabric.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha</i></span></div>\n<p>Gore-Tex’s Paclite Plus material is used instead of Active for the jacket’s body fabric. Rapha says this takes the durability of the jacket up another notch over the regular Rain Jacket, while not impacting too much on breathability.</p>\n<p>Rapha pairs the Paclite Plus material with a recycled synthetic insulation on the inside of the jacket for warmth in extreme riding conditions.</p>\n<p>Finishing touches such as a wide elasticated waist gripper, zippered cuffs and a raised, lined collar support the protective remit of the body fabric, with the aim of blocking weather ingress at the extremities of the garment.</p>\n<p>Reflective tabs on the sleeves and between the rear pockets are said to improve visibility in poor conditions.</p>\n<h3>Rapha women’s Explore Down Jacket</h3>\n<p>Back in October, Rapha updated its women’s Explore Down Jacket.</p>\n<p>The jacket has a lightweight woven nylon outer fabric filled with high loft 850-fill-power down, which Rapha claims makes the jacket 25 per cent warmer than its predecessor.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Explore Down Jacket has a detachable hood.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha</i></span></div>\n<p>The down has a durable water-repellent coating. Rapha says this helps the down retain its loft and lock in warmth in damp conditions, and there are drawcords around the waist and wrists to seal in heat too.</p>\n<p>Rapha worked with Allied Feather, a feather and down company that prioritises supply-chain transparency, to ensure fully traceable and responsibly sourced down. Rapha says you will be able to trace where the down comes from through the Allied Feather website.</p>\n<p>When it comes to fit, Rapha says the women’s-specific cut works equally well on and off the bike, and while sleeping.</p>\n<p>The jacket has a removable hood. This could prove a convenient feature to avoid too much bunching around the neck while riding or “for those packing lighter”, as Rapha says.</p>\n<p>The jacket has two zippered hand pockets and a two-way zip on the front.</p>\n<h3>Rapha men’s City Collection</h3>\n<p>Rapha has brought its technical expertise to its casual clothing with its new men’s City Collection.</p>\n<p>Available from December, the Rapha Insulated Field Coat has a full Gore-Tex exterior shell with a short-sleeve, quilted detachable liner made from recycled synthetic materials.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rapha says the new Field Coat can be used while riding as well as casually.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha</i></span></div>\n<p>Rapha says the removable liner makes the jacket adaptable for a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions – and so it should be for something costing just shy of £500.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Field Coat has a removable liner to make it more versatile.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha</i></span></div>\n<p>The collection also includes the Insulated Overshirt, which is available now. It has a wind-blocking exterior fabric and is lined with recycled Polartec Alpha insulation for warmth. Rapha says this can be used as a mid layer or an outer layer depending on the weather.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tealy autumn tones.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha</i></span></div>\n<p>The Overshirt has a chest pocket and is available in teal or navy colours. It costs £150.</p>\n<p>The City Collection also includes a pair of jeans that are said to allow for greater movement than traditional denim jeans.</p>\n<p>The £150 jeans have a few signature Rapha features, including a pink stripe at the bottom and the Rapha logo printed on the inside of the leg, both of which are made visible when you roll the leg cuffs up.</p>\n<h3>Rapha Balmamion collection</h3>\n<p>The Rapha Balmamion collection honours Franco Balmamion, “one of Italian cycling’s forgotten champions”, who won the Giro d’Italia in 1962 and 1963 with his Torinese trade team.</p>\n<p>The collection includes a number of Merino wool-blend jerseys that pay stylistic homage to the era with buttoned pockets, ribbed collars and embroidered details.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Celebrating the Eagle of Canavese.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha </i></span></div>\n<p>The jerseys have text on the front that reads “For the Eagle of the Canavese” – Balmamion’s epithet.</p>\n<p>The collection also includes a pair of black and white bib shorts, socks, a casual T-shirt and a track jacket.</p>\n<p>The collection follows Rapha republishing an updated version of Herbie Sykes’ 2008 book <em>The Eagle of the Canavese</em> last year.</p>","author":"Sam Challis","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a60711c6e47263b3927439b2e97bb153c7f42f24cb83d285deee044a011a6a37","category":"Cycling"}
