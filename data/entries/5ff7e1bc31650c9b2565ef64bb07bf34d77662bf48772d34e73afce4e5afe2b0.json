Sitting on over 4,000 acres of prime Alabama backcountry, this trail network has gone from a regional favorite to a full-blown bucket list spot for mountain bikers and trail runners. With Life Time stepping in, it’s getting a marquee event to match its growing reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Coldwater Trail MTB &amp; Run Offers Something for Everyone:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>50K and 100K MTB courses – A mix of fast flow, technical rock gardens, and classic singletrack.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15K and 50K trail runs – Rolling forest terrain with just enough challenge to keep it spicy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And the best part?</em> <strong>Qualifier! </strong> It all feeds into Life Time’s legendary Leadville Race Series. If you’re gunning for a spot in the Leadville Trail 100 MTB presented by Kenetik or the Leadville Trail 100 Run presented by La Sportiva, this is now your best shot in the eastern U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-logo-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1624\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-logo-.png\" alt=\"Life Time Coldwater trail race logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-logo-.png 1624w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-logo--297x95.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-logo--1536x490.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-logo--120x38.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-logo--768x245.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Community-Driven Trail System Goes Big</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The magic of Coldwater isn’t just in the dirt—it’s in the people. The local Northeast Alabama Bicycle Association (NEABA) and the City of Anniston have poured over $4 million into developing the area’s trails, working alongside Innovate Alabama to build out infrastructure that could cement Coldwater as the go-to mountain biking and trail-running hub of the Southeast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Over the last few years, we’ve been searching for the perfect Southeast venue for a new Leadville qualifier, and we found that in Anniston,”</em> says Kimo Seymour, President of Media and Events at Life Time. <em>“The dedication from this community and the quality of the trails made it an easy choice.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-reg-fees-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1650\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-reg-fees-.png\" alt=\"Life Time Coldwater trail race reg fees\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-reg-fees-.png 1650w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-reg-fees--297x73.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-reg-fees--1536x378.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-reg-fees--120x30.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Life-Time-Coldwater-trail-race-reg-fees--768x189.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Than a Race—A Weekend of Adventure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just about hammering through miles of dirt.
