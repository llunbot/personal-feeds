But for thousands of years after that split, the line between wolf and dog wasn’t quite clear-cut. A recent study shows that long after dogs had spread into Eurasia and the Americas, people living in what is now Alaska still spent time with—and fed—a bizarre mix of dogs, wolves, dog-wolf hybrids, and even some coyotes.</p>\n<h2>We just can’t stop feeding the wildlife</h2>\n<p>University of Arizona archaeologist François Lanoë and his colleagues studied 111 sets of bones from dogs and wolves from archaeological sites across the Alaskan interior. The oldest bones came from wolves that roamed what’s now Alaska long before people set foot there, and the most recent came from modern, wild Alaskan wolves. In between, the researchers worked with the remains of both wolves and dogs (and even a couple of coyotes) that span a swath of time from about 1,000 to around 14,000 years ago. And it turns out that even the wolves were tangled up in the lives of nearby humans.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/dog-domestication-happened-many-times-but-most-didnt-pan-out/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/dog-domestication-happened-many-times-but-most-didnt-pan-out/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
