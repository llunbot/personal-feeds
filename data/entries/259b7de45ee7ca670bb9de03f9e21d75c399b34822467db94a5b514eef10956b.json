Other than the paint, the Nemo Tig Gravel bike carries over unchanged other than spec updates and a massive selection of paint colors…but Cinelli itself has seen a lot of changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve had a new owner for about a year, and they’ve set up a US warehouse in Asheville and headquarters in Austin. All of the bikes, however, are still made in the same Italian factory that they’ve always been, and the Nemo Tig is still made from custom oversized Columbus Spirit HSS steel tubes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of cinelli nemo tig gravel bike head tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-02.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Clean, tiny welds connect the head tube, with internal brake hose routing constrasting the classic external shift cable routing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of cinelli nemo tig gravel bike seatpost binder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-04.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It keeps the seat binder lug…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of cinelli nemo tig gravel bike rear dropout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel-bike-with-columbus-steel-frame-03.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…and winged dropout for a classic look. The carbon fork has integrated fender mounts, and the bike is rated for bikepacking, albiet with strap-on frame bags since there aren’t many extra mounts beyond the top tube bag bolts.

Some colors (Green Special, Pearl White, and Champagne) are stocked and ready to ship from Asheville, but all frames in Italy are prepped for paint and waiting for the customer’s selection, so there’s no charge to select any of the colors if you don’t mind waiting about six weeks to get your bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"cinelli zydeco cyclocross disc brake bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cinelli-zydeco-cyclocross-bike.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cinelli Zydeco Lala is their base build of their original gravel bike (and also a cyclocross model for them, but with 40mm tire clearance).
