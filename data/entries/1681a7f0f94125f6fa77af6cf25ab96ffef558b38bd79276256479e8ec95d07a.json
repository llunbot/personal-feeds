For the first time in this generation, women had the chance to race three Grand Tours in one year thanks to the revitalised <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a>, which debuted in 2022. On top of that, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta </a>received a major revamp to take it to a week-long race now called the Vuelta Femenina. As for the women’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro</a>, RCS finally took control of the race to turn it into the Giro d’Italia Women. With this, the race at long last received live TV broadcasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">we delved into the fifteen Grand Tours on the men’s side</a>. Now it’s the turn of the women to have their Grand Tour stages ranked. Out of the 13 Grand Tours on the women’s side, we’ve seen a changing of the baton at the top of the GC game from Annemiek van Vleuten to Demi Vollering, surprising Grand Tour champions in Lisa Brennauer and Kasia Niewiadoma as well as the constant power struggle in the sprints between Dutch stars young and old. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, the stages have been ranked on their watchability, significance and excitement. We’ll factor in the women’s Giro d’Italia in all its iterations, the Vuelta Femenina – and the previous Ceratizit Challenge – as well as the Tour de France Femmes. Let’s get stuck in.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>21. Tour de France Femmes 2022, Stage 1</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/03040304/cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_1-08373-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_1-08373\" /><figcaption>Russ Ellis/CyclingImages</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An easy inclusion onto this list for significant reasons is the maiden stage of the Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, there was much excitement surrounding the first stage of the long-awaited return of the women’s Tour de France. Preceeding the men’s race later in the afternoon, the women had the Champs Elysées all to themselves. The boulevard even had its own QOM sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roaring around the Arc de Triomphe, the stakes were high to become the first ever Tour de France Femmes stage winner and yellow jersey – a future pub quiz answer for sure. Jumbo-Visma seemed to have the leadout nailed on for Marianne Vos as they approached the finishing line, however it wasn’t to be for the GOAT as DSM’s Lorena Wiebes whirled past on the opposite side of the road. Wiebes secured the stage and the first yellow jersey in Tour de France Femmes history. Not bad going.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Tour de France Femmes 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-femenina-2024-gallery\">The best photos from La Vuelta Femenina 2024: The empire strikes back</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">Pro cycling transfers 2024/2025: Elisa Longo Borghini finally confirms move to UAE Team ADQ, Kasper Asgreen signs for EF and Tom Pidcock rumoured to join second-division Q36.5</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>20.

With this, Stage 4 offered what was supposed to be a more relaxed day of racing – a chance for the breakaway perhaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A day after sailing into the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\" target=\"_blank\"><em>maglia rosa</em>,</a> Annemiek van Vleuten decided that the best form of defence was to attack. There was no pressure to do it, but she saw an opportunity to bag more time in the GC. It was typical Van Vleuten racing. Italian champion Longo Borghini jumped on the Movistar rider’s wheel and the two set off in search of the day’s remaining breakaway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up the road, EF’s Veronica Ewers was the only escapee able to stick in the slipstream of the two GC stars for the finale. The trio strapped in for a sprint that would eventually go the way of Longo Borghini. On a day that wasn’t supposed to be action-packed, Van Vleuten and co. still delivered something entertaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>19.

After a time-trial, a mountain stage and some punchy finales, Lotte Kopecky and Elisa Longo Borghini were barely separated in the GC standings. Coming into Blockhaus, they would have to duel once again on uphill roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the initial slopes of the Abruzzese climb, a GC filtration was already made. At 9km to go, Neve Bradbury made a plucky attack past the group to go solo in search of a first Grand Tour stage victory. Behind, Rooijakkers, Kopecky and Longo Borghini swapped attacks, but in the end, it would only tire them out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky’s climbing was pushing our expectations each day. For a tough sprinter-cum-Classics rider, she was looking stronger on the climbs than some thoroughbred mountain goats behind her at this point. With this form, the World Champion and pink jersey dropped Rooijakkers and exited the forested section of Blockhaus together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Bradbury, the stage win would consolidate her place as one of the most promising riders in the bunch. Only 45 seconds behind her, Kopecky and Longo Borghini came across the finish line side by side, ending another inseparable day of racing. With no gaps, the two would go into the final stage separated by just one second. Don’t worry, we’ll get into that later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>18.

Juliette Labous of Team DSM took a flyer early on the climb and hoped for the best. She was right to believe in herself as she claimed a deserved stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the GC group, the attacks came thick and fast. Mavi García and Annemiek van Vleuten – a duo separated by just 25 seconds at this point – traded punches and soon enough Marta Cavalli joined the party. All the main contenders were brave enough to give it a go and launch a move, but within the final 500 metres, they paid the price for their efforts as Annemiek van Vleuten broke free to extend her GC lead by just a couple of seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>17. Vuelta Challenge 2021, Stage 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh boy, do we love a mountain time-trial. Just a rider alone with a big brute of a climb to confront against the clock, they can serve up some real action. Thankfully, Stage 2 of the 2021 Vuelta tabled a low-key 7km-long mountain time-trial in Galicia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The early day’s standings were unpredictable, with Urška Žigart topping the leaderboard for much of the afternoon. Some expected Anna van der Breggen to continue her Grand Tour winning streak here at the Vuelta, but in reality the World Champion completely fell apart on a stage that looked tailor-made for her. Shockingly, she failed to even break the top ten. On the other hand, reigning Olympic time-trial champ Van Vleuten opted for a skinsuit and a time-trial bike for the whole ascent of the climb. Unlike her compatriot Van der Breggen, the Movistar rider set the fastest time atop Manzaneda, despite being behind at the first intermediate time check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a stage win the day earlier, Marlen Reusser set off last in the red jersey. The Swiss rider posted a surprisingly strong time up the climb, thus keeping her name in the ring for the overall podium. She slipped into second in the stage standings, holding on to the red jersey, while Annemiek van Vleuten took the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>16.

After a quiet three stages, the two were eager to reignite their rivalry on the roads of France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for this,<em> maillot jaune</em> Lotte Kopecky led the race from the front on Stage 4. The Belgian put in attacks early on, perhaps setting up a move for team leader Vollering. Once we came onto the final climbs of the day, we got the GC moves. The two pre-race favourites went blow for blow towards the finish in Rodez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These efforts would come to no avail as the bulk of favourites rejoined for another round of scattershot attacks. Under the <em>flamme rouge</em>, one last effort from Demi Vollering saw Van Vleuten and Kopecky unhooked from the head of affairs, with Vollering leaping forward in the overall standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this all unfolded, Fenix-Deceuninck’s Yara Kastelijn had ensured a big enough gap to claim the stage victory, becoming the first escapee stage winner in Tour de France Femmes history. Vollering didn’t get the memo, however, and she sat up for a victory photo when she rolled home in second – classic SD Worx.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>15.

After a convincing stage win the day before to Le Markstein, Annemiek van Vleuten was poised for Tour glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a last-ditch effort, the breakaway was pillaged by riders looking to jump up the GC standings. However, the peloton was too motivated to let them go. Despite a bike change with 45km remaining, Van Vleuten would take it upon herself to shuffle proceedings. One by one, the race leader passed by the all-star breakaway and returned to the front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no one else in sight, Van Vleuten would hold on over the climb to take a symbolic stage win in the yellow jersey, becoming the first rider in Tour de France Femmes history to take stage honours in the <em>maillot jaune</em>. Once at the top of La Planche, Van Vleuten was hit by an overwhelming feeling of relief having successfully been crowned the first ever Tour de France Femmes champion. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14.

After the Covid break earlier in the year, it seemed we had settled back into a rhythm. Marianne Vos was dominating the punchy finales and sprints and Annemiek van Vleuten had soloed away to a comfortable <em>maglia rosa</em> lead. On Stage 7, this all changed after the Dutch race leader was caught in a heavy pileup. She abandoned overnight and the Giro was up for grabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, Kasia Niewiadoma pinned on the pink jersey coming into the race’s final mountain stage. It was tight at the top, mind you, she only had a 15-second cushion to Anna van der Breggen in second. Factor in the strong Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig one minute down in third and Niewiadoma became the most marked person at the Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the road, Boels-Dolmans waited patiently to make their move. As the peloton thinned out on the final climb, Van der Breggen cut through the bunch and distanced the <em>maglia rosa</em>. She wasn’t alone as she towed away the ever-present Longo Borghini and white jersey holder Mikayla Harvey. Behind, Niewiadoma looked cooked on the climb, with no response to Van der Breggen’s move. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having dropped Harvey en route to the finish, Longo Borghini defeated new race leader Van der Breggen in a dash to the line. Niewiadoma wouldn’t arrive until 90 seconds later, certifying that she had lost the pink jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hard luck for Niewiadoma. She would do enough to secure the second spot on the Giro podium, her time for another jab at Grand Tour glory would have to wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>13.

So when they come around, they can be a real roulette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the mountain stages of the 2023 Tour de France Femmes, the GC rankings were finely balanced. Ahead of the final stage, second and fifth places were separated by just one minute. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the pursuit of the top three, Annemiek van Vleuten, the reigning Tour winner, faltered on the day. Her space on the podium was a fleeting prospect. As for Ashleigh Moolman Pasio, she fell out of the frame completely on the final stage. On the contrary, Lotte Kopecky, fourth coming into the stage, pulled off a stellar time-trial to throw herself into the virtual runner-up spot. Kasia Niewiadoma was the last to clock a time – she would just about squeeze into third place tied on time with Kopecky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With nails painted yellow for the occasion, Vollering kept her cool. She would arrive unfazed to claim a top-three finish on the stage and the overall title of the second Tour de France Femmes. SD Worx claimed the stage 1-2-3 with Marlen Reusser winning, as well as the first and second places in the GC, the green jersey and the team classification. Solid day at the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>12.

Already a couple of days in, she had taken a stage and moved into the leader’s red jersey. With another hilltop finish on Stage 6, we expected more of the same from the reigning Tour de France champion and new Grand Tour queen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the road, it all seemed to be going to plan Even so, Fenix-Deceuninck attempted to upset Vollering with optimistic attacks from Pauliena Rooijakkers and Yara Kastelijn. With Vollering at the helm of the chasing group, they were never going to get away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SD Worx’s tactics in response to these late moves were wholly dysfunctional though as Vollering took it upon herself to set the tempo for much of the final kilometres. As the pace became too relentless, the red jersey dropped everyone apart from FDJ’s Évita Muzic. The French rider was in good form and kept her powder dry until the very final 200m. As Vollering burned out in the final frames of the stage, Muzic slipped past to take her first Grand Tour stage victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m starting to think that Demi Vollering is just <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> in a different life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11.

Well, not many of us before this August anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure you know where this is going. After a fairly unproblematic day, Vollering was caught up in a crash with around 10km to go. Outside of the magic 3km to go marker, the time losses here were real. Her team would have to come back and tow their leader, the Tour’s current yellow jersey, back to the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her SD Worx teammates remained in the peloton though, leaving Vollering to limit her losses alone. The typical SD Worx circus was on show and nobody could quite understand what was happening. Teammates passed Vollering by whil she was stuck in lonely pursuit of the remnants of the peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead, the main group stretched out and splintered entirely in the final 3km. A few riders split off the front, consisting of GC contenders, sprinters and <em>rouleurs</em>. Some dared to attack, namely Kristin Faulkner, but it would ultimately come down to a reduced sprint. In the end, the Hungarian champion Blanka Vas – one of Vollering’s teammates – would pinch the stage win from Canyon-SRAM’s Niewiadoma. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bittersweet for SD Worx. The team gobbled up another stage win, but Vollering’s race was ultimately at risk. Without this crash, the Dutchwoman would have likely won the 2024 Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10.

Flat all day through rural Spain, you were forgiven for sitting it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For much of the day, a lone escapee looked almost certain for stage success. She’s not any old breakaway rider though, this was Anna Kiesenhofer, the surprise Olympic champion from the year prior. In bagging a gap of ten minutes at one point, she was hoping to call the peloton’s bluff and repeat her breakaway heroics from the Tokyo Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 10km remaining, the Olympic Champion’s gap was sitting just shy of two minutes. However, the peloton were on a hardwire mission to bring her back. An uphill gravel section accented the final couple of kilometres, splitting the peloton as they charged forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Kiesenhofer came into sight, the peloton were hammering the pace. Even Van Vleuten, the race leader, was struggling to hold on. The escapee was swallowed up under the<em> flamme rouge</em> and the attacks soon came. With Segovia’s aqueduct in the background, Liane Lippert ripped the group apart to create a select group of heavyweights. On the technical winding cobbled finish, SD Worx’s Vollering and Kopecky attempted to outmuscle their rivals, but it would be Valcar’s Silvia Persico who’d take her first WorldTour win in this most chaotic of finales. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sleepy day with a very caffeinated final 10km, what’s not to love?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.

Less than 24 hours after Vollering took the race lead, Movistar had their chance, caught SD Worx napping and soon Vollering was in danger. The peloton fractured into two groups, and the red jersey was left to dangle around one minute in arrears. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final 50km were far more attritional than expected. The lead group was whittled down to just a few GC contenders. Attacking for bonus seconds at 30km to go, Van Vleuten continued her charge. She was soon joined by Trek’s rising star Gaia Realini by the time the final climb of the day ramped up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Demi Vollering, she was left in a panic, organising a chase between rival teams in an attempt to limit their collective losses. Surprisingly, this ad-hoc chase had brought the group to within just one minute of the leading duo, who were almost certain of a stage win. In the two-up sprint to the line, it looked neck and neck between the 40-year-old Dutchwoman and the 22-year-old Italian. It came down to a photo finish, and then the silliness began. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Realini was declared the stage winner. She had her moment of celebration when the news came in. However, this was soon retracted and Annemiek van Vleuten was deemed the stage winner. She went up onto the podium to receive the stage trophy. Yet one final decision ruled that Realini was, after all, the stage winner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, to be a fly on the wall in the commissaires’ office on that stage. Still to this day, Realini is considered the winner of Stage 6. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

With sprinters dropped, the favourites were filtered over the Côte de la Roche-aux-Faucons. In the Belgian rain, an elite trio broke clear consisting of reigning champion Demi Vollering, multi-discipline star Puck Pieterse and Flèche Wallonne winner Kasia Niewiadoma. They co-operated well together, all with interest in the stage win as well as hopes of moving up the classifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they approached the line in Liège, Niewiadoma rolled the dice with one last-ditch attack for glory. This backfired however as the two Dutchwomen sprung out of Niewiadoma’s slipstream to juke it out for glory. In a lunge for the line, they were side by side, neither confident enough to raise their arms in victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the photo finish came through, Pieterse was declared the winner. A phenom herself, Pieterse had lived up to the hype from her cyclocross and mountain biking success. Aged just 22, this victory marked the real arrival of the effervescent youngster on the road scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.

SD Worx picked apart Lidl-Trek day by day and World Champion Lotte Kopecky was just one second behind Longo Borghini coming into the final stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the final day was riddled with tension between the two teams at the top of the classification. All eyes were on the pink Longo Borghini and the red Kopecky. With Lidl-Trek happy to let a breakaway go up the road, a motivated group of Classics riders sprung a move in search of the stage honours. Bonus seconds were off the table, so Kopecky needed to simply gap the Italian to take the pink jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the final kilometre, however, the Belgian was looking fragile towards the rear of the peloton. Aware of that fact, Longo Borgini had an extra spurt of energy and slipped off the front of the group. Frantically sprinting to the line, the Italian’s offensive paid off and she sealed her first Grand Tour title. In the space of just one kilometre the Giro was done and dusted for Longo Borghini, who had finally pulled off her career-long ambition of winning the Giro. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

A novelty for both men’s or women’s Tours de France, it was always going to be intriguing to see what would happen on the Champagne gravel of the <em>chemins blancs</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the gravel came into focus, the peloton was evidently cagey. Sectors ticked by and a host of big names were victims to mechanicals. In the chaos, you could spot flocks of riders on the side of the gravel tracks waiting for team car support. Among them were Kasia Niewiadoma, Cecilie Utrrup Ludwig, Elisa Balsamo and Mavi García, who all suffered punctures. Unfortunately for the latter, the Spaniard would end up on the tarmac after getting nudged by her own teamcar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the peloton, attacks were leaking out. Hopefuls went in search of the stage win in Bar-sur-Aube, but no chase would come together to bring back Swiss time-trial specialist Marlen Reusser who soloed all the way to stage victory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mini Classic in itself, gravel made an impactful debut on the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

With punchy Classics-like hills through vineyards, the stage was set for the Tour de France Femmes’ first uphill showdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the hills stepped up in difficulty in the final 20km, SD Worx put the hammer down in search of gaps in the overall standings. This didn’t quite work out as Vollering and Lippert slipped through a corner at the head of the lead group. The leftovers of the front group briefly ended up in the virtual yellow jersey, but the group didn’t quite cooperate. Soon enough, race leader Marianne Vos came back into the fray and the stage was anyone’s guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a kicker at 4km to go, Niewiadoma and Longo Borghini rattled the group, leading to race favourite Annemiek van Vleuten getting spat out the back. She’d come back in time for the uphill drag to the line in Épernay though. After all the efforts over the last 20km, the lead group launched a fatigued sprint to the line. Sprightly on the right-hand side, Danish champion Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig pinged past Vos to claim a famous stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes hilly stages can provide more action than mountain stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

Over the first major climb of the day, Longo Borghini was helped by teammate Realini to create an elite lead group that included race leader Van Vleuten and Niamh Fisher-Black of SD Worx. Behind, a strong chase made it back on terms with the lead group and, once regrouped, this triggered a heavy tirade of attacks on the GC leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labous and Persico looked the most stubborn out in front, however the young German Antonia Niedermaier revved right past them to go clear. Her lead was moderate ahead of Longo Borghini and Van Vleuten, who would once again reopen their GC battle in the final 10km. As they attacked each other for the right to wear the <em>maglia rosa</em>, the gap to Niedermaier came down to just over ten seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the descent, things got messy for Van Vleuten. The race leader overcooked a corner at 7km to and ended up in need of a big push to get anywhere near Niedermaier in front. Not long after, disaster struck for Longo Borghini who suffered a heavy crash, sliding off the rod and into a dirt bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaken up, Van Vleuten then faced a lone pursuit, but it was all too late. Fortune favoured the young German on the day as she sealed a first-ever Grand Tour stage win. In the chaos of the final phase of the stage, Longo Borghini abandoned the race and Van Vleuten emerged as the unopposed winner-elect of the 2023 Giro Donne.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

Unlike previous AVV attacks at the Tour, she had company in the form of Demi Vollering and Kasia Niewiadoma. The two Dutch riders toyed around on the descent, allowing Niewiadoma to divebomb ahead. Squabbling, the pair refused to work together and soon surrendered their advantage over the peloton. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the iconic Tourmalet, Vollering attacked once more, dislodging the World Champion, who was left in the fog while Vollering went in search of the stage win and the 2023 title. The SD Worx rider caught Niewiadoma and her lead was growing at an astronomical pace as she neared the finish. In symbolic fashion, Van Vleuten completely capitulated on the climb as she suffered further down the mountain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Vollering came to the top, you could barely see her victory salute through the Pyrenean fog. Regardless, she’d have to wait two minutes until her closest challenger Niewiadoma crested the climb. Van Vleuten came home not long after. The baton had been passed on, Demi Vollering was sure to be the new champion of the Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

Separated by just over one minute, Vollering needed to make back some serious time to take the Vuelta crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In anticipation, the GC favourites immediately returned to the front of the peloton once the race reached the climb. Not long after, the trio of Gaia Realini, Demi Vollering and race leader Annemiek van Vleuten popped off the front. At 5km to go, Van Vleuten was swinging from side to side on the bike and was soon distanced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Asturias clouds, the race for GC was finely balanced. Vollering needed just over one minute to take the overall lead. With the support of bonus seconds, this was within touching distance. Gaia Realini worked with Vollering and the pair were quickly amassing close to one minute of an advantage. The SD Worx rider had eyes on the stage win and the GC, unwilling to diminish her speed for a celebration until she passed over the finishing line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clock then began to tick for Annemiek van Vleuten. By crossing the line 56 seconds down, she managed to hold onto the Vuelta’s <em>maillot rojo</em> by just nine seconds. Heartbreak for Vollering. Speaking of…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

With time to make up, Vollering and Rooijakkers turned the race on its head over the summit of the race’s penultimate climb. The Dutch duo reached out for extra seconds, with Vollering chasing the overall win and Rooijakkers searching out a career-first Grand Tour podium. As a result, the virtual standings teetered between Niewiadoma and Vollering for much of the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As their advantage ebbed and flowed, the peloton’s chase seemed fruitless. Once the race moved onto the final climb, the balance of power seemed to be shifting into Vollering’s hands. In response, Niewiadoma locked herself into a frantic race against the clock, with hopes seemingly dashing on Alpe d’Huez’s hairpins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, with around 2km to go, we weren’t sure who the clock would fall in favour of. The bonus second arithmetic would have to be factored in, especially with Rooijakkers looking strong. Vollering would go ahead and take the stage and the maximum bonuses, pointing to her head in an emotional victory salute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Niewiadoma came into sight, the tense time calculations looked in favour of the yellow jersey. The official timings soon came in and she was declared the champion by just four seconds. In jubilation, the Pole lifted her yellow Canyon into the air. It was a remarkable moment for Niewiadoma who before this year <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/breakthrough-riders-2024\" target=\"_blank\">hadn’t tasted success in half a decade</a>. On the other side of the fence, Vollering was distraught, barely able to comprehend another Grand Tour heartbreak.
