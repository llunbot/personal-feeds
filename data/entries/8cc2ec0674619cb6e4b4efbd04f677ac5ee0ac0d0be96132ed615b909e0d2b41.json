By comparison, all iPhone 15 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front camera with five plastic lens elements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also claimed that at least one iPhone 17 model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/\">would be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera</a> with a six-piece lens back in January, so this upgrade has now been rumored by multiple sources, making it more likely. Kuo said these changes will \"significantly improve the image quality.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a higher 24-megapixel resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped to a greater degree, providing more flexibility in post-processing. A six-piece lens would also slightly enhance image quality, as each element is designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 17 models are expected to launch in September 2025, so they are still over a year away. Rumors about the two-generations-away iPhones always begin quite early, as Apple develops and prototypes products well before they are released.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/\">All iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature 24MP Front Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphone-17-models-again-rumored-to-feature-24mp-front-camera.2432762/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8cc2ec0674619cb6e4b4efbd04f677ac5ee0ac0d0be96132ed615b909e0d2b41","category":"Apple"}
