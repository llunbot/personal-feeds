Early on Sunday, the chain experienced a ransomware attack that hampered the three hospitalsâ€™ ability to operate normally.</p>\n<p>Beginning at midnight on Sunday, the three hospitals started diverting emergency patients to Camden Clark Medical Center. The facility is an hour's drive from Selby, which has 25 beds. Camden Clark is about a 25-minute drive from the other two Memorial Health System hospitals hit by the breach. Another affected facility providing critical care includes a freestanding emergency room at Belpre Medical Campus in Belpre, Ohio.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787517#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787517&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"908ddec6e9d0f0161b54ef8e9227b8fc9a009c30b380b6a05ae492dea89472ac","category":"Tech"}
