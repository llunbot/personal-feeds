Seattle-based F5, which sells the product, <a href=\"https://www.f5.com/c/emea-2020/event/f5-myforum\">says</a> its gear is used in 48 of the top 50 corporations as tracked by Fortune. F5 <a href=\"https://www.f5.com/products/big-ip-services/big-ip-next\">describes</a> the Next Central Manager as a “single, centralized point of control” for managing entire fleets of BIG-IP appliances.</p>\n<p>As devices performing load balancing, DDoS mitigation, and inspection and encryption of data entering and exiting large networks, BIG-IP gear sits at their perimeter and acts as a major pipeline to some of the most security-critical resources housed inside. Those characteristics have made BIG-IP appliances ideal for hacking.
