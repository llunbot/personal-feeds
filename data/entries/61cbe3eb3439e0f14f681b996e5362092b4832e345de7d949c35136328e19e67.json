However, there are three that are most likely to be there.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/m4-ipad-pro-snowflakes.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/20055/items-brands-most-often-mentioned-as-a-top-item-on-teens-holiday-wishlist/\">Piper Jaffray</a> surveys, Apple is constantly among the most desired brands among teens, appearing in 10% of all holiday wish lists, far ahead of competitors like Nike and Louis Vuitton.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>AirPods</h3>\r<br />\nAirPods are one of the most popular tech gifts during the holidays. In a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1350738/top-tech-gifts-by-number-of-buyers-us/\">2022 Statista survey</a>, headphones and earbuds were ranked as the most sought-after tech gift, with 61 million U.S. adults planning to buy them during the season.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/airpods-4-holiday.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nGiven Apple's popularity and AirPods' market dominance, it's likely they make up a significant portion of these purchases. Their relatively affordable price point compared to other Apple products, combined with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods\">frequent discounts</a>, cements their place as a top holiday gift.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recently released the fourth-generation AirPods in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-airpods-4-with-anc-buyers-guide-which-should-you-choose/\">two variants</a>: one entry-level model for $129 and one higher-end model with active noise cancellation and wireless charging for $179, which is also likely to drive gifting around this time of year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Apple Watch</h3>\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch has become a go-to gift for all ages, and its popularity as a holiday gift continues to grow. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/apple-watch-bands.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/holiday-iphones-ipads-and-macs-maybe\">recent data</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), 9% of Apple Watch owners reported receiving their watch as a gift during the holiday season, compared to just 2% the rest of the year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has expanded the Apple Watch lineup since 2020, adding the low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a> and the premium Apple Watch Ultra, offering three distinctly different models that cater to a wide range of users and budgets. Somewhat similar to AirPods, Apple Watches <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#apple_watch\">frequently see discounts</a> and the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ starts at just $249, making it an ideal gift.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>iPad</h3>\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> remains a popular holiday gift, particularly for families and students, thanks to its versatility and range of models catering to different needs. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ipad-air-black-friday.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nCIRP data shows that 6% of ‌iPad‌ buyers received their device as a gift during the holiday season, compared to just 2% in other quarters.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 10th generation ‌iPad‌, starting at $349, offers a highly accessible excellent entry point into Apple's tablet lineup. With its 10.9-inch display, A14 Bionic chip, and support for accessories like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> and Magic Keyboard Folio, it's a good choice for anyone seeking a low-cost, all-purpose device for entertainment or light productivity. For those looking to spend more, Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> provide additional options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the AirPods and Apple Watch, the ‌iPad‌ often sees <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#ipad\">discounts</a> in the lead up to the holiday period, ensuring that it remains one of the most popular holiday gifts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>What About iPhones and Macs?</h3>\r<br />\nDespite their popularity, Apple's other flagship products—the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Mac—are rarely given as gifts. CIRP data indicates that close to 0% of ‌iPhone‌ buyers and just 1% of Mac buyers received their devices as gifts during the holiday season. The reasons for this are relatively straightforward: both products are expensive, and gifting them often involves somewhat more complex buying decisions, such as signing up for carrier plans or selecting memory configurations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat Apple devices are you gifting this holiday season?
