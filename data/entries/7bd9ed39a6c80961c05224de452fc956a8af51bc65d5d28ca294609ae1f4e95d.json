When released, Universal Control will let a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices, and it's now possible to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> directly to a Mac from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari has an updated tab bar and support for Tab Groups to keep tons of tabs organized, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> now features support for spatial audio, Portrait Mode (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs only) and Voice Isolation for cutting out background noise. A SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature (coming in a Monterey update) will let <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, another new feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and the Shortcuts app is now available on the Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA dedicated Focus mode helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions based on what's going on, and there's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features. With Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images. The new beta adds Live Text support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/macos-monterey-live-text-intel-based-macs/\">for Intel Macs</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected.
