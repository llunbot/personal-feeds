In the first quarter of the year, Tesla sold tens of thousands fewer electric vehicles than it did the year before, despite a rise in worldwide EV sales. Data from April looked even worse, with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-sales-fall-by-62-in-the-uk-46-in-germany/\">substantial sales declines in Europe</a> and China. May's numbers don't look much better.</p>\n<p>Although Tesla only publishes its global production and sales numbers—and only at the end of each quarter—some countries provide monthly new car registration information, making it possible to track sales on a national level. And according to Germany's KBA, in May, Tesla sales fell by just over 36 percent year over year, even as overall EV registrations increased by 45 percent. At least that's a few hundred more cars than it managed in April.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-german-car-sales-continue-decline-may-2025-06-04/\">Similar trends</a> were seen in the UK and Italy. In the UK, Tesla sales decreased by 45 percent, even as overall EV sales increased by 28 percent. In Italy, EV sales increased by almost 41 percent, but Tesla's deliveries dropped by 20 percent.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/tesla-shows-no-sign-of-improvement-in-may-sales-data/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/tesla-shows-no-sign-of-improvement-in-may-sales-data/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
