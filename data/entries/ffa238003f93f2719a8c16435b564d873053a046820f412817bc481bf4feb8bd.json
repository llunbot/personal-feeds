The upcoming move was first reported by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8\">Associated Press</a> on Tuesday afternoon and has since been confirmed by several other outlets.</p>\n<p>The DEA currently designates marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, defined as drugs \"with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" It puts marijuana in league with LSD and heroin. According to the reports today, the DEA is moving to reclassify it as a Schedule 3 drug, defined as having \"a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\" The move would place marijuana in the ranks of ketamine, testosterone, and products containing less than 90 milligrams of codeine.</p>\n<p>Marijuana's rescheduling would be a nod to its potential medical benefits and would shift federal policy in line with many states. To date, 38 states have already legalized medical marijuana.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020872#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020872&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ffa238003f93f2719a8c16435b564d873053a046820f412817bc481bf4feb8bd","category":"Tech"}
