According to <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5673255066/OoxQuAnxl\">Ice Universe on Weibo</a>, Apple will indeed shuffle the lineup next year, most notably dumping the “Plus” model for a new flagship “Slim” model. Here’s how they say the lineup will look next year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,099)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,199)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 “Slim”</strong>: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($1,299)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things to glean from this simple list. For one, the display sizes are larger than the iPhone 15, corroborating the rumors that Apple will bump up the iPhone 16 displays. The iPhone 17 Slim here has a screen similar to the iPhone 15 Plus and Pro Max and a bit smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, all four models listed here have LTPO displays, which implies the non-Pro models will get always-on displays and ProMotion for the first time. ProMotion high-refresh rates have been one of the main differentiators between Apple’s pro and non-pro devices, so this would represent a major shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, the lineup represents a major strategic shift, with just one model under $999 and three high-end models. The Slim model reportedly will start at $1,299 with lower-end components (A19 processor, 8GB RAM), so the focus there will presumably be on the design, which could feature a much slimmer camera cutout, thinner enclosure, and slimmer bezels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about the iPhone 17, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">check out our superguide</a>, which will be updated as news arrives.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"928b62ca776f6b5969adb810440e69113330a6bc8d62fe6a2645a10cbea23817","category":"Apple"}
