For instance, the River Cottage is at the bottom of a 10 per cent gradient gravel road. This is a challenge on a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bike</a> – on a heavyweight cargo bike, it’s fierce.</p>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s Sven Cycles River Cottage Rambler\" title=\"Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall -
