Scientists have developed sophisticated algorithms to analyze the data coming down from Euclid to measure the distances and shapes of each of these galaxies.</p>\n<p>From that, scientists can infer how the influence of dark matter pulls on the galaxies, forming clusters and causing them to spin faster. Dark energy is the mysterious force that is driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982192#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982192&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9105e17bbc196ea9b0ac25b2d60307a62e419981c485348f12aa5a8ae156ee74","category":"Tech"}
