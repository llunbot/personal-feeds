In general, Labor Day sales won't top Black Friday or Cyber Monday when it comes to the quality or quantity of worthwhile discounts, but if you can't wait another couple of months to pick up your gadget of choice, this year's holiday has brought a few deals of note.</p>\n<p>Our roundup includes a number of strong prices on Apple products, for one, including the \"Product Red\" edition of the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zIq8VD\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Series 6 for $249</a>. Apple is expected to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/report-big-new-health-features-are-coming-to-the-apple-watch-just-not-this-year/\" target=\"_blank\">launch the Series 7</a> in the coming months, the discount only applies to the red model, and you may see shipping delays at Amazon. Still, this deal matches the lowest price we've tracked for what we consider the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/the-best-smartwatches-for-every-type-of-user/\" target=\"_blank\">best all-around smartwatch you can buy</a>Â right now.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, Apple's iPad Air is back down to <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1305166/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-10-9-inch-wi-fi-only-64gb-space-gray%2F-%2FA-80599151&amp;subid1=ArsLaborDay21\" target=\"_blank\">its joint-low of $500</a>. That's still not cheap, but, particularly at this price, the Air remains the closest thing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/07/apple-ipad-air-deals-100-off-amazon-best-buy/\" target=\"_blank\">to a \"just right\" option</a> in Apple's tablet lineup. The entry-level MacBook Air is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3n8PMiS\" target=\"_blank\">currently available for $850</a>, which again matches the lowest price we've tracked and is good value for what's still an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/apples-m1-macbook-air-has-that-apple-silicon-magic/\" target=\"_blank\">excellent laptop for most casual needs</a>. Other recommended Apple devices like the entry-level <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/mac-mini-and-apple-silicon-m1-review-not-so-crazy-after-all/\" target=\"_blank\">M1 Mac Mini</a>, Pencil stylus, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/best-magsafe-accessories-for-iphone-12/\" target=\"_blank\">MagSafe wireless charger</a> are also on sale.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791144#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791144&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d421de2432294ca4bc6dd0dbfafc7a0467dc7e43b2c17ef6877997dd0072024f","category":"Tech"}
