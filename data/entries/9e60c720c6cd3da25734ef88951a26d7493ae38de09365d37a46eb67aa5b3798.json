Preorders locked in before Wednesday also get a 160-page \"volume of extras.\"</p>\n<p>Wichary, a designer, engineer, and writer who has worked at Google, Medium, and Figma, has been working in public to get people excited about type, fonts, and text design for some time now. He told the Twitter world about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwichary/status/791710212390526976\">his visit to an obscure, magical Spanish typewriter museum</a> in 2016. He put a lot of work into <a href=\"https://medium.design/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9\">crafting the link underlines at Medium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/when-fonts-fall/\">explaining font fallbacks at Figma</a>. <em>Shift Happens</em> reads and looks like Wichary's chance to <a href=\"https://shifthappens.site/about-me-and-my-book/\">tell the bigger story</a> around all the little things that fascinate him and to lock into history all the strange little stories he loves.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972356#p3\">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972356&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9e60c720c6cd3da25734ef88951a26d7493ae38de09365d37a46eb67aa5b3798","category":"Tech"}
