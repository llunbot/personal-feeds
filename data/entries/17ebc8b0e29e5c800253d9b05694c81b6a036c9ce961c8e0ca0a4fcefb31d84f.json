Surprisingly enough, that very same 2014 graphics card will still be able to run follow-up <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/bioware-reveals-dreadwolf-as-the-next-dragon-age-title/\">previously known as <em>Dreadwolf</em></a>) when it launches on October 31. If you're using AMD cards, an even older Radeon R9 that you purchased back in 2013 will be able to run the game.</p>\n<p><em>Veilguard</em>'s minimum specs are just the latest to show the workmanlike endurance of the humble GTX 970, which is currently available used on Newegg for <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100007709%20600536049&amp;Order=1\">as low as $140</a>. Relatively recent big-budget PC releases like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-early-impressions-youll-spend-whole-weeks-in-here-and-love-it/\"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>Â and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> both use the old card (or the less powerful follow-up variant, the GTX 960) as their \"minimum requirement\" benchmark.</p>\n<p>Not every big-budget PC game these days is so forgiving with its minimum specs, though. When <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/a-week-spent-in-cyberpunk-2077s-beautiful-messy-urban-future/\"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/\"><em>Doom: Eternal</em></a> launched in 2020, they both asked players to be sporting at least a GTX 1060, which had come out around four years prior.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043994#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043994&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"17ebc8b0e29e5c800253d9b05694c81b6a036c9ce961c8e0ca0a4fcefb31d84f","category":"Tech"}
