Willison examined both the published prompts and leaked internal tool instructions to reveal what he calls \"a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools.\"</p>\n<p>To understand what Willison is talking about, we'll need to explain what system prompts are. Large language models (LLMs) like the AI models that run Claude and ChatGPT process an input called a \"prompt\" and return an output that is the most likely continuation of that prompt. System prompts are instructions that AI companies feed to the models before each conversation to establish how they should respond.</p>\n<p>Unlike the messages users see from the chatbot, system prompts typically remain hidden from the user and tell the model its identity, behavioral guidelines, and specific rules to follow. Each time a user sends a message, the AI model receives the full conversation history along with the system prompt, allowing it to maintain context while following its instructions.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/hidden-ai-instructions-reveal-how-anthropic-controls-claude-4/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/hidden-ai-instructions-reveal-how-anthropic-controls-claude-4/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30b1c1dcad0cc25a29d226a2970da21df2e8bfc1994d5ec06b1443c2a33e06c8","category":"Tech"}
