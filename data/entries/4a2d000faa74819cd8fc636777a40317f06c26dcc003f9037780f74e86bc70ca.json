Assos says that they're actually 'the spiritual successor' to the endurance Cento shorts.</p>\n<p>With the popular Swiss manufacturer's – perhaps debatable – belief that 'wearing the proper cycling shorts is more important than the bike you're riding', alongside the fact that the pricetag makes the Mille GTO the joint most expensive pair in its repertoire, nothing short of the highest quality is to be expected.</p>\n<h3>Old favourites and new tech</h3>\n<p>With the instantly recognisable rollBar bracing alongside the Ossidia fabric first introduced on the Mille GTS shorts, some key elements have been carried over from previous generations.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9867/assos-releases-mille-gto-c2-summer-bibshorts-images#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 15</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/assos_mille_gto_c2_6_0.jpeg?itok=TLYj34zR\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>15</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Most of the new features come in the insert which Assos says, along with the use of reversed stitch lines, helps to minimise friction and pressure on the sensitive areas and prevent wrinkling on the leg.</p>\n<p>There are three new technologies introduced that Assos says make the Mille GTO its 'plushest, most luxurious' bibshorts yet.</p>\n<p>Firstly there's the sunDeck superlight, which takes over from the kukuPenthouse feature in previous designs, that sits in front of the insert in an attempt to bring extra support and ventilation where it is most required.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/assos-mille-gt-cycling-bib-shorts-gto-c2\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Assos Mille GTO C2 bibshorts now from Wiggle</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Assos has also debuted a new textile called Losanga with a panel on the front that alleviates localised pressure too.</p>\n<p>Finally the Mille GTO C2 insert premieres the new Twin21 system. Assos explains that this is a three-layer construction that uses varying densities in an attempt to provide a plush, responsive feel.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/07/assos_11.10.228.18_42.jpg?itok=dxIXZVs3\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Those three layers are: microShock, a lightweight 11mm foam that does most of the shock absorption; filterFoam, a 10mm lower density foam that absorbs smaller vibrations and minimises moisture build-up; and 3D Waffle, a three-layer – so the insert is technically five layers – perforated foam that keeps weight down while increasing breathability.</p>\n<h3>Does anyone have an Assos discount code?</h3>\n<p>Sitting at the top of Assos's tree, they'll set you back a rather hefty £255.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/rapha/9877/lachlan-morton-has-already-completed-his-alt-tour\">Lachlan Morton has already completed his Alt Tour</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9813/halfords-donates-wind-tunnel-to-british-cycling\">Halfords donates wind-tunnel to British Cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9473/improving-diversity-in-cycling\"> Improving diversity in cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 116: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThey are available in a big range of sizes though, going from XS through XL as well as XLG and TIR for specifically taller or wider waisted riders, and there's also a choice between standard and long length, which is 3cm longer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/assos-mille-gt-cycling-bib-shorts-gto-c2\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Assos Mille GTO C2 bibshorts now from Wiggle</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>They come in two colours – or at least the lower back straps do, the main shorts are black in both options – blackSeries, which has grey straps, and Flamme d'Or, which has gold lines down the black strapping.</p>\n<p>The Assos Mille GTO C2 bibshorts are men's shorts and there isn't currently a women's equivalent.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/mille-gto-bib-shorts/\" target=\"_blank\">assos.com</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9867/assos-releases-mille-gto-c2-summer-bibshorts-images\">Assos releases Mille GTO C2 summer bibshorts images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>12 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9867%2Fassos-releases-mille-gto-c2-summer-bibshorts-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Assos%20releases%20Mille%20GTO%20C2%20summer%20bibshorts%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9867%2Fassos-releases-mille-gto-c2-summer-bibshorts-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Assos%20releases%20Mille%20GTO%20C2%20summer%20bibshorts%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9867%2Fassos-releases-mille-gto-c2-summer-bibshorts-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Assos%20releases%20Mille%20GTO%20C2%20summer%20bibshorts%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9867%2Fassos-releases-mille-gto-c2-summer-bibshorts-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9867/assos-releases-mille-gto-c2-summer-bibshorts-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 15</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/assos_mille_gto_c2_1_0.jpeg?itok=A-_1FfXL\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bibshorts\">Bibshorts</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4a2d000faa74819cd8fc636777a40317f06c26dcc003f9037780f74e86bc70ca","category":"Cycling"}
