So what Kuo is claiming is that the current “big” size will become the small size and the new big size will be much bigger. I find this very hard to believe. Since its inception Apple Watch has stood out among smartwatches <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/10/16/caldwell-smartwatches-women\">for making models that are appropriate for people with small wrists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, almost all women I see wearing and Apple Watch are wearing a small one, and I see a fair number of men who’ve chosen the smaller size as well.</p>\n\n<p>Worth noting too that three years ago Kuo, along with Mark Gurman, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/10/16/caldwell-smartwatches-women\">was completely wrong about the design of the Series 7 watches</a>, with both of them claiming it would have flat sides like the iPhone 12.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/17/mck-apple-watch-2024\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3c28e1af9bd62e23bed9772abbd17d8802f6b97b7ad5f0c1eacf0903bf8d2409","category":"Tech"}
