Redbox parent company Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/dvds-are-dying-right-as-streaming-has-made-them-appealing-again/\">moved to Chapter 7 in July</a>, signaling the liquidation of its assets. However, the app has remained available but not fully functional in various places, leaving customers wondering if they will still be able to access content they bought. This development, however, mostly squashes any remaining hope of salvaging those purchases.</p>\n<p>Redbox is best known for its iconic red kiosks where people could rent movie and TV (and, until 2019, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/mourning-the-end-of-the-video-game-rental-era/\">video game</a>) discs. But in an effort to keep up with the digital age, Redbox launched a streaming service in December 2017. At the time, Redbox promised “many” of the same new releases available at its kiosks but also “a growing collection” of other movies and shows. The company claimed that its on-demand streaming service was competitive because it had “newest-release movies” that subscription streaming services didn’t have. The service offered streaming rentals as well as purchases.</p>\n<p>But as <a href=\"https://cordcuttersnews.com/redbox-officially-shuts-down-its-roku-app-locking-customers-out-of-their-movies-tv-shows/\">Cord Cutters News</a> pointed out this week, people can no longer open the app using the Roku version of the Redbox app. When they try to use the app, they reportedly see a message reading: \"Redbox is currently not supporting this app. For questions about the service on your account, please contact Redbox” and recommends other streaming apps, like Apple TV+.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043269#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043269&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"450a373ae5cee478eefea6ec320eeda96077b6bb0143ced2b02bf2a65d3c75c2","category":"Tech"}
