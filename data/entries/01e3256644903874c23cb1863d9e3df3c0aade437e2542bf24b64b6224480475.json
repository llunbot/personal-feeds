Apple has been expanding its autonomous vehicle test since it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/14/apple-dmv-permit-autonomous-car-testing/\">granted a permit</a> from the California DMV in April 2017, enabling it to test its self-driving technology on public roads in the state. Beginning in early 2018, multiple sources reported on the number of vehicles in Apple's fleet, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/20/apple-now-testing-45-autonomous-vehicles/\">steadily expanded</a> throughout that year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEach of Apple's testing vehicles is equipped with the company's in-development autonomous driving software, along with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-car-lidar-sensors-active-talks/\">advanced LiDAR</a> equipment and an array of cameras to detect the vehicle's surroundings. The actual cars are Lexus RX450h sports utility vehicles and must have safety drivers inside of them, since, unlike rival companies that are self-driving technology, Apple's permit still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/26/driverless-autonomous-cars-approved-california/\">does not include driverless testing</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/08/applelexusselfdriving1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's fleet of self-driving vehicles are reportedly gathering data for the company's long-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/07/28/apple-car-autonomous-driving-system/\">autonomous vehicle software</a>. In June of 2017 Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/13/tim-cook-confirms-apple-autonomous-driving/\">confirmed</a> Apple's work on autonomous software: \"We're focusing on autonomous systems. It's a core technology that we view as very important. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects... it's probably one of the most difficult AI projects to actually work on.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year, it was revealed that Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/apple-self-driving-cars-doubled-mileage-2020/\">more than doubled</a> its self-driving mileage in 2020, reaching a total of 18,805 miles, up from the 7,544 miles the previous year. There were a total of 130 disengagements in 2020, up from 64 in 2019, but Apple's cars experienced a disengagement every 144.6 miles, which is a better metric than the previous year where there was a disengagement every 117.8 miles, indicating an improvement in the technology.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-expands-fleet-of-self-driving-cars/\">Apple Expands Fleet of Self-Driving Cars</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-fleet-of-self-driving-cars.2306379/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=X2sXK7p5Zhg:Sadc08I-8FQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=X2sXK7p5Zhg:Sadc08I-8FQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/X2sXK7p5Zhg\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01e3256644903874c23cb1863d9e3df3c0aade437e2542bf24b64b6224480475","category":"Apple"}
