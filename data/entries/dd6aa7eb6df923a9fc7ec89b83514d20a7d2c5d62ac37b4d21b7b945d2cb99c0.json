A good overlap with the cuffs of your jacket will also help keep the chill at bay.</span></p>\n<p><span>Your needs will also depend on how hot you run. If you’re putting in larger efforts, your hands will probably warm up after half an hour’s riding or so, even if they start out a bit too cold, and a thickly padded glove might start to feel sweaty. </span></p>\n<p><span>Wet conditions will also leave you colder, so most gloves will have a waterproof membrane and/or DWR surface coating to help keep your hands drier. </span></p>\n<h3>Materials</h3>\n<p><span>The palms of most gloves will be made of synthetic leather, although some are real leather and there are other options too. Synthetic leather typically gives good bar feel, although it may wet-out in the rain. On the plus side, it should dry quicker than the real thing.</span></p>\n<p><span>The glove’s back will usually be windproof and most winter gloves will include a water-resistant liner to help keep your hands dry. Beware, though, because some liners are more breathable than others. </span></p>\n<p><span>The best will let sweat out readily, but a cheaper liner may leave your hands uncomfortably sweaty, and they can get sore if you’re out on a long ride.</span></p>\n<p>Some cuffs are designed to fit over jackets, others under them. There needs to be enough length to ensure a decent overlap, so your wrists don’t get cold. A more chunky cuff worn over a jacket may offer more warmth, but only if it’s adequately closed; a velcro tab is the preferred option.</p>\n<h3>Grip, padding and other features</h3>\n<p><span>In wet conditions, you’ll want to make sure that you have a firm hold on the bars, so palm grip is important. Most gloves will have silicone printing on the palms and fingers for a firm hold on the bars and controls. Plus, it’s nice to have some padded areas in the palms to absorb road vibration if you’re planning longer rides, so look out for gel inserts. </span></p>\n<p><span>A touchscreen-sensitive fingertip will mean that you can operate your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> as you ride, or use your phone without taking your gloves off. An absorbent area will enable you to wipe rain from your glasses, while reflective elements or bright colours will up your road presence and help highlight your hand signals.</span></p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"dd6aa7eb6df923a9fc7ec89b83514d20a7d2c5d62ac37b4d21b7b945d2cb99c0","category":"Cycling"}
