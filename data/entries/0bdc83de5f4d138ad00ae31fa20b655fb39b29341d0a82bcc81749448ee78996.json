{"title":"★ Translation From Hostage Code to English of X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino’s Company-Wide Memo","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/translation_yaccarino_x","date":1690414219000,"content":"\n<p>Company-wide memo from nominal X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/24/read-ceo-linda-yaccarinos-message-to-twitter-staff-about-the-rebrand-to-x.html\">sent this morning</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hi team,</p>\n\n<p>What a momentous weekend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everyone said to me, “<em>Linda, what are you thinking? You don’t want to work for that guy. He’s crazy and impulsive. You’ve got a great job at NBC. You’ve got a great future ahead of you. If you take this job it’ll tank your career and your name will be a punchline.</em>” Did I listen to them?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As I said yesterday, it’s extremely rare, whether it’s in life or\nin business, that you have the opportunity to make another big\nimpression. That’s what we’re experiencing together, in real time.\nTake a moment to put it all into perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s OK to day-drink. I am.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>17 years ago, Twitter made a lasting imprint on the world. The\nplatform changed the speed at which people accessed information.\nIt created a new dynamic for how people communicated, debated, and\nresponded to things happening in the world. Twitter introduced a\nnew way for people, public figures, and brands to build long\nlasting relationships. In one way or another, everyone here is a\ndriving force in that change. But equally all our users and\npartners constantly challenged us to dream bigger, to innovate\nfaster, and to fulfill our great potential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Twitter was a simple concept with profound impact.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>With X we will go even further to transform the global town square — and impress the world all over again.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s not just you. I have no idea what’s going on either.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our company uniquely has the drive to make this possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fucking Elon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many companies say they want to move fast — but we enjoy moving\nat the speed of light, and when we do, that’s X.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Einstein’s theory of special relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, the object’s mass becomes infinite and so too does the energy required to move it. But this holds true, in degree, for all objects in motion, and a mind-bending aspect of special relativity is that the faster an object is moving, the more slowly it experiences <em>time</em>. If you were able to move at the speed of light, time wouldn’t pass at all. It would be like being damned for eternity, forever caught in the current moment, while the world moves on for everyone else.</p>\n\n<p>I think about this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At our core, we have an inventor mindset — constantly learning,\ntesting out new approaches, changing to get it right and\nultimately succeeding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We are hemorrhaging cash and our <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/technology/twitter-ad-sales-musk.html\">advertisers are still fleeing</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With X, we serve our entire community of users and customers by\nworking tirelessly to preserve free expression and choice, create\nlimitless interactivity, and create a marketplace that enables the\neconomic success of all its participants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I used to run all advertising for NBCUniversal. Now I’m running an $8/month multi-level marketing scheme where the only users who’ve signed up are men who own a collection of MAGA hats.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The best news is we’re well underway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no hope.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Everyone should be proud of the pace of innovation over the last\nnine months — from long form content, to creator monetization,\nand tremendous advancements in brand safety protections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Have you seen the ads we’re running these days? Last week we were filling everyone’s timeline with ads for discount boner pill chewing gum, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlueChew/status/1653025204501721089\">punchline of which ads</a> is that you’ll bang your lady so hard she’ll need the aid of a walker afterward. That’s a video we promoted to everyone. This week it’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1684247403065659393\">anime for foot fetishists</a>. That’s what we put in everyone’s feed, every three tweets. Or X’s, or whatever we’re now calling them. I used to book hundred-million-dollar Olympic sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Proctor &amp; Gamble. (Thank god <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Apple/status/1671364902404100102\">for Apple</a>.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our usage is at an all time high</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our owner is high as a kite.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and we’ll continue to delight our entire community with new\nexperiences in audio, video, messaging, payments, banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and\nopportunities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our focus group testing suggests that while interest in trusting this platform — which, let’s face it, is not exactly known for its reliability — for <em>banking</em>, of all things, is, as you’d expect, pretty low overall, it’s surprisingly high amongst people who know who Catturd is.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Please don’t take this moment for granted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Please quit. Get out. I beg you. Leave while you can put on your resume that you worked for “Twitter”.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You’re writing history, and there’s no limit to our transformation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As if this rebranding disaster isn’t enough, our infrastructure is crumbling. Facebook took Threads from 0 to 100 million users in under a week, without a hitch, at the same time we imposed <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/update-on-twitters-limited-usage.html\">comical rate limits</a> on usage. I mean can you even believe that shit? I still can’t. I said to him, “Elon, we are an ad-based business. Our revenue is directly commensurate to usage. This is like running a casino and turning the slot machines off to save on the electricity bill. It makes no sense.” And Elon was like “Bots!”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And everyone, is invited to build X with us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think I, saw on a TV show once that a hostage was able, to signal to authorities the need for help without alerting, their captors by placing commas randomly in their sentences.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Elon and I will be working across every team and partner to bring\nX to the world. That includes keeping our entire community up to\ndate, ensuring that we all have the information we need to move\nforward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found out about this name change when you did, at midnight on Saturday, and I have no idea what that fucker is going to do next or when he’s going to do it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now, let’s go make that next big impression on the world, together.  </p>\n\n<p>Linda</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m so sorry.</p>\n\n<p>Linda</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0bdc83de5f4d138ad00ae31fa20b655fb39b29341d0a82bcc81749448ee78996","category":"Tech"}
