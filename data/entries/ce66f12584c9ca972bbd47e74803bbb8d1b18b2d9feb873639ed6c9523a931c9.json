One of those threads came courtesy of SWFT, which introduced itself to the world <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/the-swft-volt-a-minimalist-e-bike-with-a-price-to-match/\">with the Volt</a>, an exercise in trying to get e-bike prices down to the point where they weren't competing with a decent used car. While the Volt wasn't a great bike, it was perfectly functional and offered a decent ride at a sub-$1,000 price. Now, SWFT is trying to work that same magic with a mountain bike.</p>\n<p>The second thread came courtesy of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/into-the-rivers-and-through-the-woods-specializeds-e-mountain-bike/\">Specialized e-mountain bike</a> we looked at earlier this year. In that review, I suggested that if you wanted to drop less than three or four thousand dollars on even a non-electrified mountain bike, you would sacrifice quality and features.</p>\n<p>The Apex raises the stakes of that sacrifice by keeping dual suspensions, throwing in an electric assist, and targeting the price below $2,200. The sacrifices involved are pretty noticeable and are made worse by a couple of questionable design decisions. While the bike can be fun to point at a trail, it doesn't work especially well as a mountain bike, though a lot of its issues would be easy to correct if SWFT decided to come out with a 2.0 version.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968309#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968309&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce66f12584c9ca972bbd47e74803bbb8d1b18b2d9feb873639ed6c9523a931c9","category":"Tech"}
