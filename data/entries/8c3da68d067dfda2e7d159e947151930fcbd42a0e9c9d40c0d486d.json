But the driver (version 531.18) also apparently came with a bug that caused high CPU usage on some PCs after running and then closing a game.</p>\n\n<p>Nvidia has released <a href=\"https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5450/kw/hotfix\">a driver hotfix</a> (version 531.26) that acknowledges and should fix the issue, which was apparently being caused by an undisclosed bug in the \"Nvidia Container,\" a process that exists mostly to contain other processes that come with Nvidia's drivers. It also fixes a \"random bugcheck\" issue that may affect some older laptops with GeForce 1000-series or MX250 and MX350 GPUs.</p>\n<p>Not all PCs running the newer Nvidia drivers were being affected by the bugâ€”<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1632680688968138752\">some reporters</a> observed the behavior on their systems, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aschilling/status/1632687122690744320\">others didn't</a>. Even relatively low CPU usage in the 10 to 15 percent range can have a noticeable performance impact, taking CPU cycles from other tasks and preventing the CPU from going into an idle state. This generates more heat and uses more power and could also affect the battery life of laptops.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922731#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922731&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c3da68d067dfda2e7d159e947151930fcbd42a0e9c9d40c0d486d","category":"Tech"}
