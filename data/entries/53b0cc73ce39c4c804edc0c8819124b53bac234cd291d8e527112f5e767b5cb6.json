With 180mm of plush travel front &amp; rear, a mullet wheel setup, and the latest generation of Bosch’s top CX motor backed by 800Wh of internal power – this is essentially a gravity bike with a built-in uplift. When the going gets tough, this new e180 is just getting started. And when it’s time to pedal back up again, the powerful Bosch motor will fly you back to the top. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It even has some new quiet-running Bosch secret weapons like Hill Start Assist, pedal-ratcheting Extended Boost, and just an all-together smoother delivery of the CX motor’s high torque.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Merida eOne-Eighty full power Bosch CX enduro eMTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Merida eOne-Eighty 900 eMTB complete, full power Bosch Performance CX enduro eBike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_on-top-of-Spiderman-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next up in the new Bosch-powered Merida eBike family, the eOne-Eighty is the heavy-hitter.

This is an extra burly bike meant to “shred the gnar”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact on paper, it’s not so dissimilar to the e160 &amp; e160SL – built to ride pretty much any technical trail, with similar geo, and a premium Bosch ebike motor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_geometry-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Merida eOne-Eighty eMTB, full-power Bosch Performance CX enduro eBike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_geometry-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_geometry-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_geometry-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_geometry-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_geometry-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, the new eOne-Eighty actually features less progressive-looking geometry – a steeper headtube, shorter frame Reach, and even shorter chainstays – than the e160 family. But that’s really because Merida worked hard to give this heavier, bigger travel ebike the same light maneuverability as its short &amp; lighter siblings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Merida eOne-Eighty 900 eMTB, size Large 27.2kg actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_Large-size-27200g-actual-weight-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, how it feels to ride is a completely different story. This is a 7kg heavier eMTB than the e160 SL.

Slightly reduced weight, the same overall power, but quieter &amp; smoother pedal assist, and new smarter assist modes. Like Hill Start that basically reimagines a new type of assist like Walk Mode, where you can easily pedal from a dead stop on the steepest, loosest terrain without wheelspin and without rolling backward. Or Extended Boost that lets you smash down on the pedals in short bursts in eMTB mode only (without pedaling a full circle) to propel yourself forward with powerful pedal-assist on sections of trail when there isn’t enough clearance to pedal normally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there’s the big new 800Wh internal battery, which can be extended even further with the same 250Wh PowerMore range extender external bottle battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Merida eOne-Eighty 900 eMTB, full power Bosch Performance CX enduro eBike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_side-on-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by Manuel Kleinmann/Merida)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Merida calls the new eOne-Eighty an eBike built “<em>for riders who seek the most challenging lines, are no longer willing to compromise on big<br />mountain capability, and love to ride their favorite trails all day long</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding the all-new Merida eOne-Eighty</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Merida eOne-Eighty 900 eMTB, full power Bosch Performance CX enduro eBike, climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_photo-by-Manuel-Kleinmann_climbing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by Manuel Kleinmann/Merida)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this is a pretty progressive enduro ebike. And yes, with 180mm of travel at both ends, this is an eMTB that can bomb down anything from your local enduro tracks to full-on bikepark trails. But it really is a blast to ride uphill, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merida says they developed size-specific kinematics for the new eOne-Eighty so smaller, lighter riders get the same plush yet supportive suspension feel as taller, heavier riders. That means bigger bikes are more progressive so there’s increased resistance to bottoming out the bigger you go. That’s even more interesting tied to Merida’s Agilometer sizing concept, where most riders can size up or down to get a bike with longer Reach &amp; more stability or shorter cockpits &amp; improved agility. Now you can add increased suspension progression with longer sizes, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most interesting bit here is that suspension progression moves in relatively small steps, except… The smallest XShort bike is extra plush and more linear than the others, specifically to give a much more active ride to the much smaller, younger, and lighter riders who tend to end up on Merida’s smallest bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_climbing.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_climbing.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Merida eOne-Eighty 900 eMTB, full power Bosch Performance CX enduro eBike, climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_climbing.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_climbing-297x251.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_climbing-1536x1296.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_climbing-120x101.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_climbing-768x648.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So back to my first impressions of riding the new Merida eOne-Eighty…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first proper riding I have done on the latest iteration of the Bosch CX motor. And I can say it is a vast improvement. The new setup feels just as power</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has the added benefit of being much quieter. No rattling, and almost silent operation in all but the maxed out Turbo mode’s full-boost. Also, the new Purion 400 display is everything I loved about Shimano’s Di2/EP8 display and more. You get easy-to-view feedback on remaining battery power, what assist mode you are in, ideal cadence range to get the best support, and an estimated remaining range for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for range… we all know it is super subjective, but I’ll leave you with this. I took off on a fast-paced ride with the new eOne-Eighty trying to squeeze as much riding as I could into a very short time. So I (85kg) rode more than 38km of very steep, technical terrain with more than 1250m of climbing, pretty much entirely in full Turbo mode on the 800Wh battery. And I came back with more than 20% of battery remaining after more than 3 hours out – 2 hours &amp; 15 mins of ride time. Realistically, most regular rides would have been more conservative. But in any case, I had plenty of power to spare after a really solid ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2025 Merida eOne-Eighty – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_400-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_400-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Merida eOne-Eighty eMTB, full-power Bosch Performance CX enduro eBike, 400\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_400-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_400-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_400-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_400-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Eighty-900-eMTB_full-power-Bosch-Performance-CX-enduro-eBike_400-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>2025 Merida eOne-Eighty 400</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The full-power, full-send aluminum Merida eOne-Eighty ebike comes in 4 complete build spec options, 5 sizes, and 5 different colors depending on spec.
