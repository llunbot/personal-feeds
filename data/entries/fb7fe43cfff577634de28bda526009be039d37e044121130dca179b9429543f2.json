WorkOS is a modern identity platform for B2B SaaS, supporting SSO, SCIM, user management, and RBAC.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, WorkOS acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization (FGA) service for developers. Warrant’s product is based on Zanzibar, the open source authorization system originally designed by Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.</p>\n\n<p>WorkOS is already used by hundreds of high-growth startups like Vercel, Webflow, Plaid, and Perplexity.</p>\n\n<p>If you are looking to build enterprise features like SSO, SCIM, or RBAC, consider WorkOS. It’s a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/28/workos\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fb7fe43cfff577634de28bda526009be039d37e044121130dca179b9429543f2","category":"Tech"}
