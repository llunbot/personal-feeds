However, a recent survey of a wetland in what’s now Belize suggests that the rise of the Maya civilization was fueled not just by maize but by tons of fish every year. University of New Hampshire archaeologist Eleanor Harrison-Buck and her colleagues recently mapped a network of channels and ponds for trapping fish, built just before the Maya civilization rose to prominence.</p>\n<h2>Fish in a barrel</h2>\n<p>Harrison-Buck and her fellow archeologists used drones and Google Earth data to map 108 kilometers of ancient channels that zigzag across 42 square kilometers of wetland in Belize’s Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary. The result is a network of channels and ponds that looks remarkably like the fish traps found farther south in Bolivia, built several centuries after the ones at Crooked Tree. Radiocarbon dating of material buried in the bottom of one channel suggests that the network has been around for at least 4,000 years.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/ancient-fish-trapping-network-supported-the-rise-of-maya-civilization/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/ancient-fish-trapping-network-supported-the-rise-of-maya-civilization/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
