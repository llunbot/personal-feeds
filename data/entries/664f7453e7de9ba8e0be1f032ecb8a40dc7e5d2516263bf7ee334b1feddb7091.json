Unlike with previous mobile chip releases, the 2023 options for ultralights from Intel and AMD are mostly similar to their predecessors. In the case of premium ultralights and 2-in-1s relying on integrated graphics, the gains are small enough that budget shoppers should consider a last-gen model, assuming all other things are equal, and save hundreds with a negligible loss in performance.</p>\n<p>When Intel announced its 13th Gen mobile lineup in January, we called the chip <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/intels-new-13th-gen-laptop-cpus-are-very-mild-year-over-year-improvements/\">“mildly improved</a>.” The new chips are pretty boring compared to the 12th Gen release, when Intel brought its hybrid Alder Lake architectures to laptops and introduced the P-series. 13th Gen brings such minimal changes, as our testing will illustrate, that ultralights featuring 12th Gen systems are still worth serious consideration comparatively. And a specs comparison suggests a similar story with AMD Ryzen 6000 versus 7000.</p>\n<p>As Ars' Andrew Cunningham wrote upon Intel's announcement of 13th Gen mobile, the lineup is \"mostly identical to the 12th Generation CPUs they're replacing.\" 13th Gen brings notable updates to HX chips, including more E-cores than before and, with some of the chips, support for speedier RAM. But when it comes to the chips you'll likely find employed in thin-and-light laptops—the P and U series—there's far less of that \"new and shiny\" feel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923886#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923886&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"664f7453e7de9ba8e0be1f032ecb8a40dc7e5d2516263bf7ee334b1feddb7091","category":"Tech"}
