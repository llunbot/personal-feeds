All three now show as out of stock for shipping, and the reporter was able to find just one store in his local area with units for pickup. I had a similar experience.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Walmart-M1-MacBook-Air-out-of-stock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Walmart M1 MacBook Air out of stock\" width=\"1200\" height=\"681\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>I’m out of luck, and they’re out of stock.</figcaption></figure><p>David Price / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>(As a side note, I’ve been unable to find new units of the M1 Air in any other stores close to me, including Amazon.

As it’s unlikely that Walmart just happened to run out of stock after two years, it seems Apple and Walmart have decided to wind down sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the decision could be related to cost-cutting measures due to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2999407/apple-ram-prices-mac-iphone-ipad-margins-costs-price.html\">memory prices ballooning</a>, this timing adds credence to the rumors of a cheap MacBook expected within the next two weeks. Apple recently announced <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3062338/apple-books-special-experiences-around-the-globe-on-march-4.html\">global “experiences” on March 4</a>, and it’s widely rumored that it will announce a series of new entries in its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook lines in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3064717/apples-march-event-might-bring-several-days-of-surprises.html\">days leading up to that</a>. Rumors about the new MacBook claim it will use an A18 Pro iPhone chip and cost around $699, both reasons to stop selling these M1 models. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the truth, we should find out soon.
