According to Prologo,  this project was born with the goal of creating a saddle that could highlight, in 3D, all the qualities of an already winning and beloved Scratch M5 saddle shape. Developed based on studies and tests that analyzed the pressure zones for both professional and amateur cyclists, the M5 PAS 3DMSS features a rounded shape, which provides extra support to the lumbar area.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-scaled.webp\" alt=\"The Scratch M5 3D on a Pinerello Dogma\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_13-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>(Photos/Prologo)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to an effective shape, the pressure mapping data helped Prologo develop a cover made of separate double-layer sectors, designed to adapt to different pressure areas and ensure efficient performance during the entire pedal stroke. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cover of the new SCRATCH M5 PAS 3DMSS combines Prologo’s MSS (Multi-Sector System) technology with an innovative 3D-printing process that uses digital light projection, oxygen-permeable optics, and engineering-grade materials to produce polymer parts with exceptional mechanical properties, resolution, and surface finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 3D-printing technique allowed the creation of three separate sectors on each side of the saddle, which adapt optimally to the individual pressure areas and follow the cyclist’s morphology.  Each sector features a double upper and lower layer, with different complex geometric shapes, varying densities, and differentiated elastic coefficients. Put simply, each zone of the saddle adapts to the volume and pattern of pressure that is applied to it so that it <em>feels</em> consistent throughout its entire length.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-scaled.webp\" alt=\"The Scratch M5 3D on a Pinerello Dogma\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_10-720x480.webp 720w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the M5 PAS 3DMSS also includes PAS technology – Perineal Area System, or simply put, a generous cutout. And, like all high-performance models from Prologo, it rests on a base made of injected long-fiber carbon, a material that offers an excellent compromise between lightness, rigidity, and comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rail trim options include the Nack (Nano Carbon Fiber) version made of carbon fiber, kevlar, and aluminum filaments for maximum rigidity and lightness, or the Tirox version, made of light alloy steel, which offers an excellent weight-resistance balance and gives the saddle lower rigidity and superior vibration absorption.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1707\" height=\"1216\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_5-scaled-e1744307579334.webp\" alt=\"A close-up of the M5 3D surface structure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_5-scaled-e1744307579334.webp 1707w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_5-scaled-e1744307579334-297x212.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_5-scaled-e1744307579334-1536x1094.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_5-scaled-e1744307579334-120x85.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scratch-M5-3D_5-scaled-e1744307579334-768x547.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Pressure zones, a generous cut-out, 3D-printed cover, and carbon rails make the M5 PAS 3DMSS Nack a premium and likely highly effective saddle.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SCRATCH M5 PAS 3DMSS will be available in the first half of May with a list price of $437 with Nack rail and $325 with Tirox rail. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dimensions: 250 x 140 mm<br />Profile Shape: Round<br />Weight with Nack rail: 176 grams<br />Weight with Tirox rail: 209 grams<br />Rail diameter: Nack 7×9.3mm; Tirox 7mm</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://prologo.musvc2.net/e/tr?q=5%3d1aGX2Y%26y%3dS%26n%3dZFT%26o%3daKY4a%268%3d0tQ3K_rxfr_3h_5sSw_Eh_rxfr_2m3JoI29o.F7_JQzc_TFB1_JQzc_TFMn9eP_5sSw_Eh3AzKs%26A%3dzMsSpT.nB73a8n%26As%3dbGS7%26Q6%3dT0YHb4gGb7gDW9%26E%3dFX2fsS8BK5bfL6ddMU5Xo84aFa8fK3c9Ibf0r5dfHW28M44eG4d9L55gKT1gI43f&amp;mupckp=mupAtu4m8OiX0wt\" target=\"_blank\">www.prologo.it</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prologo-3d-printed-scratch-m5-pas-3dmss-saddle/\">Prologo Expands 3D Range With Scratch M5 PAS 3DMSS</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d38a9f1fce10719926aa7f21dede452f01fc029f66f1f19b2d0e18de1d3823ac","category":"Cycling"}
