They disperse what little traffic there is into practically nothing and follow the landscape with a rare empathy, appearing to always go around rather than through the terrain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Col de Roque-Jalere isn’t the steepest ascent at 5.7%, and it’s followed by a thrillingly rapid descent</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I have never come across more corners, which can be sickening when you’re a passenger in a car, but it’s pure joy as a cyclist. Most of all, though, the area is known for its spectacular gorges, and our route for today includes two of the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m joined by two fellow ex-patriots, friends Adrian Howell and Mike Cotty (of Col Collective fame), both super-strong cyclists who jumped at the chance to take on a Big Ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve driven over from the Hautes-Pyrenees, where Mike and I both run cycling holiday businesses (mine’s called <a href=\"https://www.escapetothepyrenees.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Escape To The Pyrenees</a>, seeing as you ask) and as we roll out of the small town of Prades at 9am we’re immediately struck by how sharply this end of the mountain range contrasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Golden Eagle flies (no crows here, the eagles ate them all), I’m 200km from home but it feels like a thousand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flora is distinctly Spanish-looking and so are many of the town names; the village of Catllar is the gateway to the mountains, just outside Prades. The road signs are even bilingual – French and Catalan – and carry the red and yellow colours of the latter, not the blue, white and red of France.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>From the Col de Roque-Jalere the road rises out of the landscape towards the Gorges de Galamus</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We’ve already been climbing gently for a while when we swing right onto the 10.7km Col de Roque-Jalere. With fresh legs we tap up the moderate gradient briskly, excitement battling discipline. It may only average 5.7% but there are some grippy ramps along the way and it’s steeper near the 991m peak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re at the top in 45 minutes and it feels like a good downpayment on the day. A glance at my bike computer shows 650m gained, a firm reminder that, despite the two prominent peaks on the route profile, we’re far from halfway done with climbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we eat some food and don gilets for the descent, we look out into the haze across the broad valley.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05-768x1023.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05-1153x1536.jpg 1153w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05-750x999.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05-1140x1519.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The River Agly had a hand in shaping the gorge, and the wind funnelling through the rocks helps you to pick up speed, despite the twists and turns</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On a clear day the 2,784m Pic du Canigou would dominate the skyline. So prominent is the Canigou, only 50km from the sea and sat on the end of the Pyrenees like a bookstop, that it was once thought to be the highest mountain in the range (when in fact it’s over 600m short and not even in the top 100). It retains a near-talismanic significance to the area as a Catalan symbol and, more practically, the region’s main tourist draw.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>By gorge!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a shame to miss an iconic view but swift recompense arrives 4km into the writhing and surprisingly well-surfaced descent when the next valley suddenly reveals itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our progress remains rapid as the descent hands off to 20km of false flat and then to a strong tailwind. The road rises and pierces the looming ridgeline, spitting us out into the town of Saint-Paul-de-Fenouillet and towards the next wall of rock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small climb takes us to the head of Gorges de Galamus. With 60km covered it’s a bit early for a cafe stop, but you stop where the cafes are and this one comes with an incredible view into the gorge for good measure.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Col du Linas is a gentle climb in the shadow of the giant Pech de Bugarach that looms overhead</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While the gorge itself was carved patiently over millennia by the River Agly, the road was built in the 1890s by men hanging from ropes using crude tools such as crowbars to create a channel in the rock. It’s only one car wide with just a smattering of passing places, and so low is the overhanging rock that we sometimes feel compelled to duck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gorge road is downhill and the southerly wind is boosted by the Venturi effect of the funnel-like walls, so speed comes easily and feels magnified by the constant tight corners, very close rock face and big drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I let go of the brakes it’s about as close as road cycling gets to the intensity of downhill mountain biking and seems ripe for a Red Bull event. The Tour misses out, though. You couldn’t even fit a team car with bikes on the roof down here, let alone the various rolling novelties of <i>La Caravane</i>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Cubières-sur-Cinoble we turn west across the top of our route and collect a couple more cols – Mike’s influence rubbing off.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"877\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-08-877x970.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-08-877x970.jpg 877w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-08-271x300.jpg 271w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-08-768x850.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-08-750x830.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-08-1140x1262.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Overhanging rocks and narrow tunnels like this one make the Gorges de Galamus even more claustrophobic</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Cols de Bancarel (0.8km, 5%) and Linas (4km, 4%) barely seem worthy of naming though, especially with the monolithic Pech de Bugarach towering above us.

We have 63km and a huge climb still to go, and the weather that’s blowing in doesn’t look so kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any notions we may have held of bobsleigh-like descending are immediately dismissed, however. There’s just so much loose gravel on the recently dressed surface. Our guess is that ASO chose to send the Tour up The Snail rather than down it as much to save having to sweep away all the gravel as for the prolonged helicopter beauty shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Col of the wild</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having negotiated the tricky descent, the D117 from Caudiès-de-Fenouillèdes to the Pont d’Alies is the right road at the right time – wider, faster, beautifully surfaced, with a tailwind and still quiet. It’s ideal for ticking off some kilometres so we fall into line and swap punchy turns.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The road rises through the Gorges de Saint-Georges, around 100km into the ride, en route to the climb up the Col de Jau</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The 2.5km Col du Campérié is more false flat than climb and is dismissed in the big ring. Its descent is equally easy and turns into a supertucking slipstream battle, a nose thumbed to the UCI’s new regulations banning the position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The turn south after 94km is significant for several reasons: it takes us towards the Gorge de Saint-Georges, another scenic high point of the route, plus it sets us on a heading back towards the incoming weather. Most of all, it kicks off 23km of climbing, with 5km of grinding <i>amuse-bouche</i> before the Col de Jau begins in earnest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rising 1,034m in 18km, the Jau blows apart any ideas that the Pyrenees-Orientales can’t be every bit as challenging as the rest of the range. And if its 5.8% average sounds tame, we haven’t accounted for the two stretches of 3km that average 8% and peak at 10%, by which time we have over 100km and 2,000m in the legs.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-11-970x875.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-11-970x875.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-11-300x271.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-11-768x692.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-11-750x676.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-11-1140x1028.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-11.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s suddenly a lot warmer too, and the sweat is pouring off us as we climb, an inevitable flicker of competitiveness descending over our mini peloton as the increasing gradient lights a fire under our toes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Col de Jau has only made three appearances in the Tour (1976, 1993 and 2001) and always in the middle of the stage as the peloton heads west towards the more famous Pyrenean cols.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not a climb that would ever be a highlight of the Tour – it’s not hard enough to split the bunch, and there is too much overhanging rock and tree cover for the TV pictures – but it is a fantastic climb for the rest of us.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-12.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The tail of The Snail, looking down to Caudiès-de-Fenouillèdes</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Jau is pretty, varied, traffic-free and just about challenging enough to feel rewarding once you reach the top. We climb between rock walls, through a short tunnel and under a canopy of trees barely divided by this slender strip of tarmac. Such is the escapism it feels close to a gravel riding experience but without going off-road, which sounds like the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The climb forks after 6km. Right would take us over the Col de Garabeil (1,262m) and towards the ski stations of Les Angles, Pyrénées 2000 and Font-Romeu. Instead we turn left for the final 12km to the summit and notice the temperature fall several degrees in as many minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first raindrops arrive 5km from the summit, but they’re sporadic enough to suggest they might amount to nothing more. A kilometre later we’re sheltering under trees from persistent drizzle as we shove some more fuel in.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-13-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-13-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-13-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-13-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-13-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-13-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-13.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Snail’s loops are an engineering marvel, however you look at them</figcaption><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Adrian feels on the edge of a bonk and rapid-fires a few gels to catch it just in time.

It’s falling in drops so big that each is like a water bomb exploding on the rapidly flooding road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The temperature has halved to 13˚C but thankfully the rain itself feels warm. This storm had been forecast for tomorrow, part of a system that has put a third of France on ‘orange alert’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the summit the trees give way to dense cloud, though I only realise we’re at the top because the car carrying photographer Sami has stopped, which at least gives us the chance to don rain jackets as lightning flashes directly overhead.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"749\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14-749x970.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14-749x970.jpg 749w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14-232x300.jpg 232w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14-768x995.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14-1186x1536.jpg 1186w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14-750x971.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14-1140x1476.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-14.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We really need to get off this exposed summit fast but, frankly, I’m on the wrong bike. As much as I love my Swift, this debris-strewn road is shining an unforgiving light on its 25mm tyre clearance, and the limits of its rim brakes are being cruelly exposed by descending in torrential rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike and Adrian both have disc brakes and 28mm and 30mm tyres respectively. I’m usually an advocate of #SaveTheRimBrake, but today it’s more a case of #SaveTheRimBrakeForSunnyDays. I don’t get dropped but my stress levels rise in inverse proportion to my stopping power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bleary eyed from descending without glasses, we roll into Prades and congratulate each other on a ride that has left us buzzing. The Pyrenees-Orientales may lack the spectacle of the high mountains further west, but they have a substance that has left me profoundly satisfied.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Catalonia complexity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The region that is a bit France, a bit Catalonia</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"744\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-15-744x970.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-15-744x970.jpg 744w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-15-230x300.jpg 230w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-15-768x1001.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-15-750x977.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-15.jpg 1000w\" /><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It might look like the Pyrenees-Orientales has an identity crisis, torn between being French and Catalan, but in reality it’s more a crisis of understanding for visitors, albeit one made more complicated by recent events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The department broadly corresponds to the old territory of Northern or French Catalonia, which was once part of Spain but was handed over to France in 1659 at the end of the Franco-Spanish war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spanish political crisis of Catalan separatism, which peaked in 2017 with an attempted referendum declared illegal by the government, has echoed across the border and there is a small but highly vocal minority campaigning for Northern and Southern Catalonia to be united and independent. The prevalence of Catalonian iconography and language easily gives visitors the impression that this opinion is far more commonly held than is the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not wealthy Spanish Catalunya would want the considerably less affluent French Catalonia to join it is a question that never quite gets answered. What’s clear is that this part of France strongly identifies as Catalonian <i>and</i> French, and that the regional and national identities can co-exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Orientales Express – Pyrenees Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/orientales-express-pyrenees-big-ride-17.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Sami Sauri</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From the UK it’s a lengthy ten-hour drive from St Malo if you take the excellent overnight ferry, or 12 hours from Calais.
