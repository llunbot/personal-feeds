In his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-25/how-jony-ive-openai-deal-will-impact-apple-new-details-on-apple-s-ios-redesign-mb3lwu45\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter this week</a>, he said that the design changes will extend to tvOS 19 for the Apple TV and watchOS 12 for the Apple Watch, but he did not provide any specific details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe design changes will apparently be inspired by visionOS for Apple's Vision Pro headset, and visionOS 3 is expected to have some design tweaks of its own.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, Gurman said Apple is aiming for a more consistent appearance across its operating systems, especially for the Mac and iPad. He previously reported that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/\">iPadOS 19 will make iPads more like Macs</a>, with improved multitasking, productivity, and app window management. In addition, a leaker known as Majin Bu claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ipados-19-mac-like-menu-bar-rumor/\">iPadOS 19 will display a macOS-like menu bar</a> while an iPad is connected to a Magic Keyboard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman previously revealed that iOS 19's new design is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/30/apple-codename-for-ios-19-design/\">codenamed \"Solarium,\"</a> which is a room with glass walls that allow in sunlight. The codename could hint at the more translucent menus and buttons that are expected across iOS 19 and the other upcoming software updates, which Apple will announce during WWDC 2025. The developer conference is just two weeks away, with the keynote <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/\">set to be held on Monday, June 9</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite the buzz surrounding AI lately, Gurman believes that the redesigned software platforms will be \"the highlight of the show\" at WWDC this year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2025</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/26/tvos-19-watchos-12-design-changes-rumor/\">iOS 19 Design Changes Rumored to Extend to Apple TV and Apple Watch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-design-changes-rumored-to-extend-to-apple-tv-and-apple-watch.2457714/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41d52fe93b57a8005e34aae3b4aa93564af61d61381c21329c4f0c6db04f5eb2","category":"Apple"}
