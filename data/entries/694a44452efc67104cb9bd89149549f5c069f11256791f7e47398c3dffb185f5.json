Pu shared this prediction in a research note today alongside some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/\">details about the more imminent iPhone 15 lineup</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-15-Pro-Multi-Purpose-button-Mute-Switch-Feature-Green-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nSolid-state buttons were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/\">initially rumored for iPhone 15 Pro models</a>, but Apple reportedly faced \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/\">unresolved technical issues before mass production</a>\" and had to revert to mechanical buttons. Pu previously said the solid-state buttons would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/?p=891935&amp;preview=true\">postponed until iPhone 16 Pro models</a>, but he now believes even those devices are unlikely to have them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple supplier Cirrus Logic <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/23/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-hint/\">hinted at the solid-state buttons</a> in a shareholder letter last year, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/05/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-cancellation/\">seemingly confirmed the plans were scrapped</a> in May.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a solid-state design, the buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro would not have moved when pressed. Instead, it was rumored that two additional Taptic Engines inside the iPhone would have provided haptic feedback to simulate the feeling of movement, similar to the Home button introduced with the iPhone 7 and the Force Touch trackpad on newer MacBooks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 15 Pro models are still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/iphone-15-pro-action-button-cads/\">expected to feature a mechanical Action button</a> in place of the Ring/Silent switch. It is likely that users will be able to assign the button to various system functions, such as Ring/Silent or Do Not Disturb.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith solid-state buttons now considered unlikely through 2024, it remains to be seen if Apple will ever move away from mechanical buttons on the iPhone. A benefit of solid-state buttons would be fewer moving parts that can break, and there is also potential for improved water resistance given there would be fewer points of ingress.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 16 Pro models are still over a year away from launching, so Apple's plans for the devices remain subject to change.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons-low-chance/\">iPhone 16 Pro Now Has 'Low' Chance of Featuring Solid-State Buttons</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-now-has-low-chance-of-featuring-solid-state-buttons.2395203/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"694a44452efc67104cb9bd89149549f5c069f11256791f7e47398c3dffb185f5","category":"Apple"}
