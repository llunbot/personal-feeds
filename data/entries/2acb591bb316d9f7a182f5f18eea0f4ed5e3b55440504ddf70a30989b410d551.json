DarwinAI created AI technology for inspecting components during the manufacturing process, and it also had a focus on making smaller and more efficient AI systems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nDarwinAI's website and social media accounts have been taken offline following Apple's purchase. Dozens of former DarwinAI companies have now joined Apple's artificial intelligence division. AI researcher Alexander Wong, who helped build DarwinAI, is now a director in Apple's AI group.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple confirmed the acquisition with the statement that it typically gives when questioned about purchases. \"Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time\" but does not discuss its purpose or plans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an effort to catch up with Microsoft, Google, and others in the AI market, Apple is working hard to build artificial intelligence features for its next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and macOS 15 operating systems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf Apple wants to be able to rival Microsoft's Bing, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and other generative AI offerings, it will need to integrate generative AI into a range of products. Apple is testing large language models, and AI features are said to be coming to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, Shortcuts, Messages, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is aiming to have AI features run on-device for privacy reasons, and DarwinAI's efforts to make smaller AI systems could be of use to further that endeavor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/\">has promised</a> that Apple will \"break new ground\" in generative AI in 2024. \"We believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users,\" said Cook.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-acquisition/\">Apple Acquisition</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/apple-acquires-darwinai/\">Apple Buys DarwinAI Ahead of Major Generative AI Updates Coming in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-buys-darwinai-ahead-of-major-generative-ai-updates-coming-in-ios-18.2421935/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2acb591bb316d9f7a182f5f18eea0f4ed5e3b55440504ddf70a30989b410d551","category":"Apple"}
