Apple is also wrapping up work on iOS 17 to release it to the public right around the same time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/top-stories-26aug2023.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWhile the iPhone reliably gets annual updates, this week we also took a look at a number of other Apple products that are quite a bit longer in the tooth and offered our recommendations on whether they're still good purchases right now, so read on for all the details on this week's top stories!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 14 Pro vs. 15 Pro: 20+ Upgrades and Changes to Expect</h2>\r<br />\nSeptember is fast approaching, and that means new iPhones are just around the corner.

Apple has yet to officially announce the event, but invites should go out at some point over the next week or two.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro to Come in Blue and Gray Titanium, No Gold Expected</h2>\r<br />\nThe upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/apple-iphone-15-pro-colors/\">available in a few new colors, including Blue and Gray</a>, according to <em>9to5Mac</em>. These colors were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/iphone-15-pro-blue/\">first reported by <em>MacRumors</em></a> last month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Blue-Top-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" />\r<br />\nThe report said that Gold will no longer be a color option for the iPhone 15 Pro models, which are expected to have a brushed titanium frame in a departure from polished stainless steel.
