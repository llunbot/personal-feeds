{"title":"iOS 18, macOS 15 and everything else coming from Apple in June","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2348553/everything-coming-from-apple-june-2024-wwdc-ios-18-and-more.html","date":1717151400000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>June is a big month for Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all starts with the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where Apple talks about all the great features and improvements coming to its platforms later in the year. That’s followed immediately by the first round of developer betas, so devs can start testing their apps and making updates using the new frameworks and APIs. A public beta typically follows a few weeks later, often in early July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, Apple introduces new hardware at WWDC–Macs are a favorite, as that’s the core product for developers. Last year also saw the unveiling of the Vision Pro headset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let’s not forget the usual releases for Apple’s content services: Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. Those will continue throughout June as usual. Here are all the things we expect from Apple this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC 24 software: iOS 18, macOS 15, and AI, AI, AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> is a week-long event, but the part we all care most about is the opening keynote. This year that happens at 10 am Pacific Time on Monday, June 10. It will stream live on Apple TV, YouTube, and Apple.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this keynote, Apple will take the wraps off its fall operating systems, just as it does every year. That’s <strong>iOS 18</strong>, <strong>iPadOS 18</strong>, <strong>macOS 15</strong>, <strong>tvOS 18</strong>, and <strong>watchOS 11</strong>. And for the first time, we’ll get a section devoted to the first major update to Vision Pro, <strong>visionOS 2</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> update is supposed to be one of the biggest ever, with substantial changes to many of Apple’s core apps. But the big focus is expected to be on AI, with an overhauled Siri and AI features found throughout iOS and its apps. We expect a lot of the AI stuff to be available in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15</a> as well, but there’s no telling to what degree tvOS and watchOS will be impacted by the dramatic AI push.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC 24 hardware: Macs? Something else?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC keynotes have featured some major new hardware announcements—the 15-inch MacBook Air, Vision Pro, M2 chip, the Apple silicon transition, HomePod, iMac Pro—so we’re always on the lookout for new gear to make some noise during the WWDC keynote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this year might be a quiet one. We’re not expecting anything major, but a Mac mini or MacBook Air with the M4 chip isn’t out of the question. Or we could be surprised by a new Apple TV or HomePod, though based on the latest rumors, either release wouldn’t bring major changes to the existing models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately following the WWDC keynote, Apple generally makes available a beta version of iOS and macOS available to developers (and sometimes other OSes as well). This comes weeks before the first public beta, which is usually released in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 18 developer beta:</strong> We expect a big push into AI in iOS 18, with AI features in many core apps and a revamped Siri. There’s also new features such as RCS support and a more customizable Home screen, as well as new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2334546/apple-to-bring-eye-tracking-vocal-shortcuts-music-haptics-and-more-accessibility-features-to-iphone-and-ipad.html\">accessibility features</a>, and plenty of app design and feature improvements that aren’t AI-related. We have a whole article about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">what to expect from iOS 18</a>, but nothing is definite until Apple makes a formal announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPadOS 18 developer beta:</strong> Expect most of the same features as in iOS 18, including the addition of a brand-new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2312825/ipados-18-calculator-app-14-years-later.html\">Calculator app</a>. We’re not sure what iPad-specific features Apple has in store for new tablets, but a perpetual ask is for more consistent and flexible multitasking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS 15 developer beta:</strong> We think most of the new AI features from iOS 18 will appear in macOS, except where the Mac varies greatly in design and capabilities. We have an article detailing the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">latest macOS 15 rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>tvOS 18, watchOS 11 betas:</strong> Not much is known about what Apple has in store for these, only a rumor suggesting that neither one is due for a very big change. And we excpect Apple’s AI push will reach these platforms as well, but we haven’t heard any specific rumors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
