{"title":"Acorn 8’s Documentation","link":"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/docs/","date":1734542319000,"content":"\n<p>One last item on Acorn 8. Whether you are a longtime Acorn user (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/09/10/acorn\">like me</a>), or a would-be new user, you should set aside some time to actually read Acorn’s documentation. It’s a full user manual, and it not only describes, in detail, what every feature in the app does and how to use them, but also a vast array of “how-to” tutorials, many of them videos.</p>\n\n<p>In broad strokes, there are two approaches to documenting a serious, professional-level app or software system. One way is a comprehensive functional reference resource. That’s a way that you, the user, can teach yourself how to use a feature, refresh your memory about a feature you haven’t used in a while, or even just check to see if a certain feature even exists. The other is a narrative, storytelling, tutorial approach. That’s not teaching yourself — that’s letting an expert teach you, and today that’s often a visual approach through video.</p>\n\n<p>Acorn’s documentation is so thorough that it encompasses <em>both</em> approaches. Either one would qualify Acorn as a well-documented application. But by including both, Gus Mueller should be given some sort of medal or award. Different people learn in different ways, and Acorn’s documentation is there for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>It should go without saying, but no serious tool — hardware or software — is complete without thorough, polished documentation. Acorn goes above and beyond. It’s amazing enough that a company as small as Flying Meat — it’s really <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/about/\">just Gus and his wife Kirstin</a> — has produced a full-fledged professional-strength image editing application that has remained modern and cutting-edge for 17 years and counting. But it’s also accompanied by first-class comprehensive documentation.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/acorn-8-docs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"41f2939c8d23747be84b07881c37e9fbeba49798daa454130acb61bdf651daed","category":"Tech"}
