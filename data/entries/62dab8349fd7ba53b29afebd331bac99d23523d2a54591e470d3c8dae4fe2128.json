This week, it’s Sophiestication Software promoting the return of CoverSutra — <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/01/coversutra-2-brings-itunes-search-ui-enhancements-more/\">a previous hit</a> from the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/delicious-library-eol\">“delicious” era</a> of Mac apps that is now back and better than ever.</p>\n\n<p>After over a decade, the rejuvenated (<em>reanimated?</em>) CoverSutra has been reimagined as a sleek, standalone music player for your Mac that lives in your menu bar, giving you seamless access to your music library. Instantly search by album, artist, or song — all without breaking your workflow. Some of what’s new:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Standalone music player: No Music app required.</li>\n<li>Instant music search: Find tracks anytime, anywhere.</li>\n<li>Global keyboard shortcuts: Control playback from any app.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Available now on the Mac App Store for just $4.99 — and a free upgrade for CoverSutra 3.0 customers. Five bucks, one time, and it’s yours to keep. And it’s just so polished, so simple, and so nice.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/14/coversutra-is-back\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"62dab8349fd7ba53b29afebd331bac99d23523d2a54591e470d3c8dae4fe2128","category":"Tech"}
