If a cat is simply a mechanical system that obeys Newton’s rules of matter in motion, it should land on its back. (OK, there are some technicalities—like this should be done in a vacuum, but ignore that for now.) Instead, most cats usually avoid injury by twisting themselves on the way down to land on their feet.</p>\n<p>Most people are not mystified by this trick—everybody has seen videos attesting to cats’ acrobatic prowess. But for more than a century, scientists have wondered about the physics of how cats do it. Clearly, the mathematical theorem analyzing the falling cat as a mechanical system <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04565\">fails for live cats</a>, as Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek points out in a recent paper.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036947#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036947&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b97293e23c9cdc5318b48f183a532680dcec74f81f304e00c55a6a51ae41ca1","category":"Tech"}
