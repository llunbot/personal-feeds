This week, we’ve taken a handful of your questions on road bike gearing and pitched them to the experts at Classified Cycling and ROTOR America. Your contributors this week are:</p><ul><li>Lori Barrett, Managing Director at <a href=\"https://rotoramerica.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ROTOR</a></li><li>Jef Van Herck, Marketing Manager at <a href=\"https://classified-cycling.cc/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Classified Cycling</a></li></ul><p><strong>We know some manufacturers have designed a road freehub that will accept a cassette running from 10T (or smaller). How long before they offer a 12s road cassette going from 10T? It’s needed, even at the top level. I wish I had £5 for every time I watched competitors in the three Grand Tours of 2021 spin out when racing downhill. Plus, I want one, for my 28/44 (or 26/42) White Industries touring super-climber chain set.</strong></p><p><strong>Classified:</strong> The reasoning behind the 10th sprocket is coming from 1X drivetrains, where the full gear range has to come from the cassette alone. In order to increase the total gear range for 1X drivetrains, the largest sprockets were made larger and the smaller ones smaller.</p><p>When riding a 2X system, there is no need to go to these extreme sprocket sizes, allowing you to ride a more compact cassette with small steps between sprockets, which runs smoother. For road races we therefore don’t believe that a 10th is needed, as a 2X drivetrain is the standard. To gain speed when riding downhill, it is more efficient to increase the chainring size, which also decreases your chain forces.</p><p><strong>ROTOR America: </strong>We answer range queries with our 1×13 groupset. The 13s has a 10T cog that is outboard from the freehub body, making it compatible with a standard HG freehub body on the ROTOR 13s hub. With massive cassette options from 10-52 down to 10-36, going from road gearing to touring rig climbing gears is as simple as changing the cassette.</p><div id=\"attachment_233748\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-233748\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Rotor 1x13 TT aero hydraulic time trial drivetrain groupset, Kona IronMan Ventum Profile Design concept bike\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike-696x418.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rotor-1x13-TT-aero-hydraulic-time-trial-drivetrain-groupset_Kona-IronMan-Ventum-Profile-Design-concept-bike-700x420.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-233748\">Check out ROTOR’s 1×13 TT Aero Time Trail Groupset <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/03/30/rotor-1x13-tt-shifts-out-new-aero-13-speed-hydraulic-triathlon-time-trial-groupset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p></div><p><strong>Will&nbsp;<span>ROTOR</span>&nbsp;have road DM double ring sets that work for SRAM AXS (road)? That means 13 tooth difference between the inner and outer ring AND teeth shaped to work with the SRAM 12 Speed FlatTop chain.</strong></p><p><strong>ROTOR America: </strong>We released AXS-compatible 2x chainring sets in round &amp; oval in August of 2019. We added to the range this spring with 107 BCD for SRAM Force, expanding the size offerings with 50/37, in addition to the 48/35 already available.</p><p><strong>What is the most efficient cadence for hill climbing (road cycling), and what factors affect this?</strong></p><p><strong>Classified: </strong>According to one of the World Tour riders who is testing our Classified shifting system on a daily basis, the perfect cadence for hill climbing is around 90, but he sees a lot of variation in the peloton. In case of extreme tiredness and exhaustion, the control of the muscles is less anyway. This will cause you to pedal harder in order to maintain an efficient pedal stroke.</p><p><strong>ROTOR America: </strong>A lot of pedal stroke efficiency depends on the strengths of the individual cyclist. Some riders’ physiology works best in a low gear and high cadence (depending more on aerobic capacity,) while others succeed with a heavy gear and low cadence, depending more on muscular strength. ROTOR believes that oval chainrings benefit all categories of climbers, as the adjustable oval allows the rider to experience less drag in the back of the pedal stroke while maximizing the strong push on the front side.</p><p><em>Got a question of your own?
