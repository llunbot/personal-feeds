Firewalk Studios Game Director Ryan Ellis <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/\">said in an announcement Tuesday</a> that publisher Sony will offer refunds to all players who purchased the game on PC or PlayStation 5.</p>\n<p>Sony may not need to pay out that many refunds. GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing\">told IGN</a> last week that he estimated an underwhelming 25,000 total sales for the game across PS5 and PC. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, meanwhile, said that just 0.2 percent of all active PS5 players were playing the game last Monday, making it the 147th most-played title for that day.</p>\n<p>The Steam version of the game peaked at well under 700 players just after launch, <a href=\"&lt;a%20href=\">according to SteamDB tracking</a>. On PlayStation, popular opt-in trophy tracking site PSNProfiles logged <a href=\"https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28912-concord\">just over 1,300 players who owned <em>Concord</em></a>, a relatively small showing compared to popular recent releases like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> (<a href=\"https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28905-star-wars-outlaws\">4,300 PSNProfiles owners</a>) and Black Myth: Wukong (<a href=\"https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28916-black-myth-wukong\">16,000 PSNProfiles-tracked owners</a>).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046849#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046849&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c027859a5d13a829793c2104326c9d968d3ea83d60c86b178e7e828c4ad1f190","category":"Tech"}
