{"title":"Ian Hickson: ‘Reflecting on 18 Years at Google’","link":"https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373&count=1","date":1701204954000,"content":"\n<p>Ian Hickson, who recently left Google after an 18-year stint:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The lack of trust in management is reflected by management no \nlonger showing trust in the employees either, in the form of inane \ncorporate policies. In 2004, Google’s founders <a href=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/ipo-letter/\">famously told Wall \nStreet</a> “Google is not a conventional company. We do not \nintend to become one.” but that Google is no more. </p>\n\n<p>Much of these problems with Google today stem from a lack of \nvisionary leadership from Sundar Pichai, and his clear lack of \ninterest in maintaining the cultural norms of early Google. A \nsymptom of this is the spreading contingent of inept middle \nmanagement. [...] </p>\n\n<p>It’s definitely not too late to heal Google. It would require some \nshake-up at the top of the company, moving the centre of power \nfrom the CFO’s office back to someone with a clear long-term \nvision for how to use Google’s extensive resources to deliver \nvalue to users. I still believe there’s lots of mileage to be had \nfrom Google’s mission statement (“to organize the world’s \ninformation and make it universally accessible and useful”). \nSomeone who wanted to lead Google into the next twenty years, \nmaximising the good to humanity and disregarding the short-term \nfluctuations in stock price, could channel the skills and passion \nof Google into truly great achievements. </p>\n\n<p>I do think the clock is ticking, though. The deterioration of \nGoogle’s culture will eventually become irreversible, because the \nkinds of people whom you need to act as moral compass are the same \nkinds of people who don’t join an organisation without a moral \ncompass. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This jibes with my perception of Google from the outside. Early Google did two things great:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They introduced a steady stream of groundbreaking new products and services that served their mission statement, with broad appeal to the public.</li>\n<li>They ruthlessly fought against bloat and feature creep in the products they had already shipped.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Neither of those things has been true in recent years, and the responsibility clearly falls on Pichai.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/28/hickson-google\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"01c62b054fb6d532fc88b3084d70e25d168d92ab2a3c34dcd000dc1b56cba2a4","category":"Tech"}
