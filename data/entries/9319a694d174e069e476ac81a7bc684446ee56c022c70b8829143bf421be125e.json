{"title":"Recommended: ‘Chimp Empire’","link":"https://www.netflix.com/title/81311783","date":1684787400000,"content":"\n<p><em>Chimp Empire</em> is a four-part (an hour-ish each) documentary about two rival chimpanzee groups in Uganda. It’s one of the best, most enjoyable, most engaging, and most informative cinematic experiences I’ve ever had. My wife and I devoured it. It’s extraordinarily beautiful and compelling. It’s a story about two warring groups, replete with interesting characters and compelling drama. Scheming, backstabbing, loyalty, social climbing, bravery, cowardice. It’s all there.</p>\n\n<p>The question my wife and I kept asking ourselves was, <em>How the hell did they capture this remarkable footage?</em> It couldn’t be fake, but it seemed utterly impossible how <em>close</em> the camera crews got to the chimps — including while the two tribes fight. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/how-chimp-empire-was-made\">Netflix has a behind-the-scenes video and story</a> that explains how this was even possible:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While it would normally be impossible to capture the intimacy of\nwarring chimps in the wild, the filmmakers benefited from an\nenvironment long marked by human activity — thanks to a constant\nswarm of researchers. “It took 25 years to reach the point where\nwe can walk out and be near the chimps. We’re humans, so the\nchimps just see us as an extension of the presence that’s been in\nthe forest for years,” Reed told Netflix.</p>\n\n<p>This familiarity allowed the camera crew to capture <em>Chimp Empire</em>’s\nmost stunning scenes. But up-close encounters were still just\nas bizarre as you might expect.</p>\n\n<p>“I remember suddenly being aware that the Ngogo chimps were all\naround. It’s like being on <em>The Truman Show</em> or something — you\nfeel like you’re on a set, because you can’t quite believe they’re\nreal,” Reed said. “They’re so human, you know that they’re\nassessing you in the same way that you’re assessing them. You\ncan’t quite believe that they accept you into their world. You go\nwhere they go, but they make all the decisions. The only thing you\ncan control is where you turn your cameras, or whether you keep up\nwith the action. It’s quite humbling, and I quite like it. The\nonly thing you can do is put yourself in the best position\npossible to record what they’re doing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’ve got Netflix, start watching <em>Chimp Empire</em> tonight.
