The Threads social network can be <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@macrumors\">accessed on the desktop</a> and mobile devices using any web browser.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg\" alt width=\"1079\" height=\"607\" />\r<br />\nSince <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/instagram-threads-app-now-available/\">its July debut</a>, Threads has only been available on mobile devices through dedicated apps.
