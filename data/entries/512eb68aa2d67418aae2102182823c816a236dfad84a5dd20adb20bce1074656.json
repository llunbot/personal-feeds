The animal looked like the typical black-and-white cow farmers raise for milk, except for one thing: Researchers had outfitted Cow D with an artificial fistula—a hole offering them a way to reach the microbes inhabiting the animal’s bathtub-size stomach. But it’s what happened next that offers a porthole into the global debate over the use of genetic data.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2009, Samantha Noel, then a doctoral researcher at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand, reached into Cow D’s rumen and plucked out a strain of Lachnospiraceae bacterium, later dubbed ND2006. Another team of geneticists sequenced the microbe’s complete set of genes, or genome, and uploaded the information, which was then shared with GenBank, a public database run by the US National Institutes of Health. If genes are the book of life, then this process was like adding a digital copy to an online library. In policy circles, these lines of code go by another name: digital sequence information, or DSI.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a section of the sequence found inside Cow D caught the attention of scientists on the other side of the world. The sequence contained a promising new genetic tool for modifying DNA, a CRISPR. Editas Medicine, a Massachusetts-based company focused on commercializing gene-editing technology for medical applications, used these data to build its platform and now holds the license on a portfolio of patents—all without ever interacting with the cow or its microbes directly. The company subsequently developed an experimental therapy, which involved injecting a modified CRISPR-associated molecule into patients’ eyeballs to treat a common form of inherited blindness. Editas billed the breakthrough as the first such treatment “administered to people anywhere in the world.” The results, <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309915\">published</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine, contain little mention of any sequence data and even less about its origins.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/who-gets-ownership-of-useful-genetic-data/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/who-gets-ownership-of-useful-genetic-data/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Peter Andrey Smith, Undark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"512eb68aa2d67418aae2102182823c816a236dfad84a5dd20adb20bce1074656","category":"Tech"}
