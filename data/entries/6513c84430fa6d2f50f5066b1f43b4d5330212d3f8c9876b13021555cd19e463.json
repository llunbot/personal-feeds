Some architectural details from Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple BKC features a triangular handcrafted timber ceiling that\nextends beyond the glass façade to the underside of the exterior\ncanopy, reflecting the unique geometry of the store. Each tile is\nmade from 408 pieces of timber, forming 31 modules per tile with a\ntotal of 1,000 tiles that make up the ceiling. There are over\n450,000 individual timber elements, all of which were assembled in\nDelhi. Upon entering the store, customers are greeted by two stone\nwalls sourced from Rajasthan and a 14-meter-long stainless steel\nstaircase connecting the ground level and the cantilevered\nmezzanine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@ChanceHMiller/110221138059961880\">Chance Miller on Mastodon</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tim Cook reacting to someone who brought a Macintosh SE to the\nopening of the Apple BKC store in Mumbai today.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the happiest I’ve ever seen him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those things <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_se.html\">weigh 17 pounds</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/18/apple-bkc-india\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6513c84430fa6d2f50f5066b1f43b4d5330212d3f8c9876b13021555cd19e463","category":"Tech"}
