They got up close and personal with some of the biggest brands in cycling showing off their latest wares, ensuring BikeRadar was awash with highlights deep into the week.</p>\n<p>Back in a stubbornly grey UK, one show wasn’t enough for us, as Jack Luke served up his pick of the new products from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cycle-show-2023/\">The Cycle Show</a> at London’s Alexandra Palace.</p>\n<p>The rest of the editorial team hit the ground running too, with reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/cannondale-junction-helmet-review/\">Cannondale Junction</a> helmet and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/multi-tools/topeak-ninja-master-toolbox-pt30-multi-tool-review/\">Topeak Ninja Master Toolbox PT30</a>.</p>\n<p>Tuesday saw news of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ultima-multipath/\">Ultima Multipath</a>, an ebike made of recycled plastic and alloy. At the tail end of the spring classics season, Oscar Huckle got his keyboard fingers warmed up to tell us what he’d love to see from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/new-specialized-roubaix/\">a new Specialized Roubaix.</a></p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Warren Rossiter’s review of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/bmc-roadmachine-amp-one-review/\">BMC Roadmachine AMP</a> ebike broke cover, and we recounted the story of how the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/catesby-tunnel\">Catesby Tunnel</a> – a state-of-the-art wind tunnel in Northamptonshire – came to be from its humble beginnings as a railway line.</p>\n<p>Thursday saw Jack Evans school us all on how to make use of our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">heart rate and power training zones</a>, while the BikeRadar team took the opportunity to fantasise about the bike they’d own if they <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/dream-bike-lottery\">won the lottery</a>.</p>\n<p>All this, and the team have been busy beavering away to make sure all the latest news and reviews continue to land on the BikeRadar homepage.</p>\n<p>Now, here are some of those tidbits I mentioned.</p>\n\n<h2>Ergon SR Allroad Core Pro Carbon saddle</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Ergon SR Allroad saddle is said to straddle the divide between road and gravel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Ergon SR Allroad Core Pro Carbon saddle might be a little over-named for my taste, but it features some tech worthy of note for road and all-road riders.</p>\n<p>Inside lives a so-called ‘ergonomic core’ made up of BASF Infinergy material.</p>\n<p>Infinergy is a 3D foam structure that’s claimed to dampen jolts and bumps from the road, also notable for its use in running shoes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I’m pretty sure I’ve seen similar material in the soles of my Nikes before now…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This is layered on top by orthopaedic ‘AirCell’ foam to improve sit bone pressure distribution, while the underbody is made of carbon composite.</p>\n<p>The saddle features a cutout section to relieve perineal pressure, while it’s available in two sizes to best suit bike fit needs.</p>\n<p>A small/medium size features a narrower width at 139mm, while the medium/large size is 152mm wide.

I’m glad for this, given Velcro straps (and any associated clips) tend to rub away at the finish of expensive seatposts over time.</p>\n<p>The opening face folds over and fastens shut with the Velcro too, which removes the need for zips (these can corrode in the face of winter detritus).</p>\n<p>The trade-off is the Tool Pouch isn’t quite as weatherproof as some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-saddle-bags/\">best saddle bags</a> on paper, but if you’re running good <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> that shouldn’t be much of an issue.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The interior features 0.6l of carrying capacity.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Inside is 0.6 litres of capacity, with an internal sleeve to hold smaller items that might jangle about.
