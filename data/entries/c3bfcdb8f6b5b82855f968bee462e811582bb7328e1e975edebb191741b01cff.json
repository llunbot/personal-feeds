When it then comes to refitting, unless the previous mechanic that worked on the bike left a little extra length (or you’ve gone through that length), the hose is often too short and therefore requires complete replacement.</p>\n<p>The brake then needs to be bled and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-wrap-bar-tape/\">handlebar tape rewrapped</a> on a drop-bar bike.

He feels it’s wasteful having to bin perfectly good items for the sake of replacing a headset bearing.</p>\n<p>This is corroborated by Jamie Watkins, another cycling industry stalwart who has worked in a variety of roles at Sigma Sports, iRide and Carbon Bike Repair. He’s currently a senior service technician at Canyon UK’s warranty department in Chessington, Surrey.</p>\n<p>He criticises “the often inadequate space and harsh angles coupled with the need to be born an octopus holding onto five things at once”.</p>\n<h3>Small parts, complex solutions</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Although still difficult to route, it is significantly easier running an electronic set-up with an integrated set-up.

Cables and hoses are often subjected to tight angles as they are run through these intricate systems. This can make brake bleeding more difficult, because the hose isn’t run in a straight line and air pockets can get trapped in the tight corners.</p>\n<p>It’s more of an issue for mechanical gear cables though, with the tight angles they are subjected to introducing unnecessary friction. Gear cables perform best when they are run in as direct a line as possible. Poor shifting quality, therefore, is a common complaint.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS rear derailleur and cassette on Look 765 Optimum\" title=\"SRAM Force AXS rear derailleur and cassette on Look 765 Optimum\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Integration makes more sense when using a wireless electronic groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>It’s why an increasing number of brands are designing their frames specifically around <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a>, because the shifting quality doesn’t suffer if the wires take an awkward route. It isn’t an issue at all on SRAM AXS systems or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/campagnolo-super-record-wireless/\">Campagnolo Super Record Wireless</a>, precisely because they are wireless.</p>\n<h3>Additional wear and tear</h3>\n<p>Watkins says hydraulic hoses suffer, too, because they are often held very tightly in place and can become pinched or subject to adverse wear. He says he has regularly seen hoses wear down to the base plastic, as a result of half-considered solutions, and pinching issues where “although the brake lever felt solid, fluid wasn’t flowing [through the hose] so the brake didn’t operate”.</p>\n<p>Watkins says he is yet to find a brand that offers a good solution from a mechanic’s point of view, but is keen to point out “some brands are worse than others”.</p>\n<h3>A lack of standards</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Berria Belader Allroad LTD against a graffiti background\" title=\"BR_09999\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many manufacturers rely on their own solutions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Tommy Barse is the owner of Cutlass Velo in Baltimore, Maryland, and specialises in servicing and custom bike builds. His Instagram account (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cutlassvelo/\" target=\"_blank\">@cutlassvelo</a>) is well worth a follow.</p>\n<p>Barse is annoyed by “the lack of a standardised approach to bearings, the steerer assembly, handlebar routing and process”.</p>\n<p>For the most part, integrated systems are developed by the bike brand and can often even be model-specific. For example, Trek uses a different handlebar and stem arrangement for its Domane and Madone models</p>\n<p>As such, brands use differing headset bearings and cable routing methods. If you’re a mechanic who works day-in, day-out on certain brands, you soon get used to those brands’ philosophies, but many of the mechanics questioned for this article are required to to work on all brands and bike models.</p>\n<p>And if the lack of standards is confusing for experienced mechanics, how can a home mechanic be expected to work confidently on proprietary designs with no standards across the industry?</p>\n<h3>An expiry date for your pride and joy?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Side view of bike cockpit\" title=\"Green Custom Venge-23\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Will spares for the Venge, for instance, be available in years to come?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Dubash furthers this argument, suggesting “your fancy new road bike now has a ‘best before’ or ‘use-by’ date like perishable food” and wonders if the parts required for specific integrated systems will be readily available in years to come.</p>\n<p>Specialized, for example, has gone through four variations of integration on its road bikes (and even more when you factor in its Shiv TT / triathlon bike) – the Venge ViAS, third-generation <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-venge-sram-etap-review/\">Venge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl7-review/\">Tarmac SL7</a> and now the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl8-dura-ace-di2-review/\">Tarmac SL8</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of spare parts a brand needs to keep in the back catalogue to be readily available if and when riders require a replacement.</p>\n<p>“If you are unfortunate and take a tumble, the parts will need to be replaced like-for-like,” Dubash adds. This wouldn’t be a problem on a conventional handlebar because you don’t need to necessarily replace exact parts like-for-like.</p>\n<p>Proprietary parts can also come at an additional cost, compared to competitive aftermarket options. Remember, that’s before you factor in the increased labour bill for complex maintenance.</p>\n<h2>How would you improve integration as it is now?</h2>\n<p>Matt Millard is the workshop manager of Rides on Air, a bike shop in Wallingford, Oxfordshire that sells Trek and Merida bikes, among other brands. He has previously run workshops at Evans Cycles and Mountain Trax.</p>\n<p>One way Millard suggests improving integration is by having any cables and hoses routed through a separate channel, rather than through the headset bearings. In theory, this would mean the lines could remain intact during a headset service.</p>\n<h3>The cables and hoses route through a separate channel</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo Carbon Ultegra\" title=\"Road Bike of the year 2021 10\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The third-generation Cannondale SuperSix Evo routed the hydraulic hoses through a separate channel in front of the headset bearings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s a design some brands have already experimented with, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-supersix-evo-carbon-disc-ultegra-review/\">third-generation Cannondale SuperSix Evo</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/trek-domane-slr-9-9-project-one-review/\">third-generation Trek Domane</a> took a similar approach but routed the cables and hoses through a channel behind the headset bearings.</p>\n<p>While this may seem like a logical solution, it has its drawbacks. Cannondale had to incorporate a steering stop into the front end of the bike to avoid the cables being effectively guillotined or the carbon fracturing if the handlebar was over-rotated.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo manual\" title=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo manual\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cannondale even said oversteering was not covered under warranty in the owner’s manual.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<p>Incorporating a separate channel also means the profile of the head tube needs to change, which means the top of the fork crown then needs to be sculpted to suit. This can lead to paint rubbing where the fork meets the head tube, or worse, fracturing if it is over-rotated.</p>\n<p>Watkins suggests more space needs to be created for cables and that manufacturers need to “have a better consideration for how the bike can be disassembled and serviced throughout its life”. Having more space for the cables would result in less friction if a mechanical gear cable is used and, likely, an easier time for the mechanic.</p>\n<p>“If nothing else, a lesser bill on the customer’s part having purchased a £10,000 machine might make them feel better about their purchase,” he says, emphasising what a wholly frustrating and miserable experience working on such bikes can be.</p>\n<h3>Hydraulic hose developments</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano olive and barb against a white background\" title=\"Shimano olive and barb against a white background\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The olives and barbs need replacing on Shimano and Campagnolo systems every time you cut the hose.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>Both Dubash and Watkins suggest improvements could be made to hydraulic hoses. Dubash advocates for a ‘plug-and-play’ option so you don’t need to cut the hose every time you undo the line.</p>\n<p>He thinks it’s “a shame to trim back already optimally sized hoses” when they become “too short for safe operation”.</p>\n<p>Barse thinks integrated systems would be better if brands specced “fully stainless bearings, or a bushing system, or what seems to be a hybrid like CeramicSpeed’s SLT”.</p>\n<p>CeramicSpeed’s SLT (Solid Lubrication Technology) bearings are claimed to have very low-maintenance cycles and not wear out, and are backed by a lifetime warranty.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Factor Ostro Gravel against a graffiti background\" title=\"DSC00308\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> CeramicSpeed’s SLT headset bearings are claimed to be unkillable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The system is starting to become more commonly specced on bikes from Factor, Canyon, Colnago and Pinarello – and for good reason. Given headset replacement is the chief concern of mechanics, if the bearings won’t ever theoretically need replacing, that can only be a positive.</p>\n<p>Barse also suggests all systems should run full-length housing over the hoses, shift cables or electronic wires to eliminate any potential rattling.</p>\n<p>Wallis would like to see more logical routing choices and better quality control. He says “most of the time lost on jobs comes from fighting with poor routing choices and messy / lazy manufacturing such as leftover bladder / epoxy inside of holes that snag a brake hose or cable”.</p>\n<p>The holes are often only just big enough to fit the hoses and cables through and Wallis says he often has to “improvise a tool” when the ends of an internal cable routing guide are too large to fit through a hole.</p>\n<p>He says he “wouldn’t mind a few extra grams on a frame with cleaner internal cable routing if it made maintenance easier”.</p>\n<h2>Should the bike industry adopt a single internal cable routing system?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"FSA ACR system on Cipollini Ago\" title=\"FSA ACR system on Cipollini Ago\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Could a system such as FSA’s ACR be the solution we need?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Some brands, such as FSA, have tried to introduce integrated systems that can be adopted by numerous frame manufacturers. While FSA’s ACR system has seen moderate uptake from a handful of brands, including Argon 18, Bianchi and Vitus, it hasn’t ignited an integration revolution.</p>\n<p>All of the mechanics suggested a single system was wishful thinking. Barse, Dubash and Wallis likened the prospect of a single internal cable routing system to other bike components that are rife with so-called ‘standards’, such as the infamous array of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket standards</a>.</p>\n<p>One reason why Watkins believes this won’t happen is because “brands have a look of their own they want to achieve”.</p>\n<p>It’s a fair point, and brands would need to compromise their creative freedom if they were tied down to a certain design at the front end. This is supported by Barse, who says “if a [bike] manufacturer designed it, competitors want nothing to do with it”.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Barse, Millard and Wallis all say they would be in favour of a single routing system if it ever happened, though. The benefits, Barse says, include giving mechanics a better “sense of the cost and time” to complete a job.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the costs associated with the increased labour and replacement parts needed for integrated systems can come as a shock to unsuspecting customers and it can be very difficult to price a job, given the unknown variables before a mechanic begins their investigative work.</p>\n<h2>What are the differences in service costs for replacing headset bearings?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Roval Rapide cockpit on Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2\" title=\"Roval Rapide cockpit on Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 Dura-Ace Di2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can expect service costs to increase significantly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>With the significantly increased labour time required to, for example, replace a headset bearing, you can expect the workshop bill to increase in tandem.</p>\n<p>Millard suggests routine maintenance tasks can typically cost more than triple a standard headset service.</p>\n<p>Dubash isn’t able to suggest a typical increase in cost because he charges by the time taken to do a job, rather than trying to predict this beforehand. He admits “Profitability goes out of the window to some extent in the pursuit of an end result I’m satisfied with”.</p>\n<p>One only needs to look at Dubash’s Facebook page to understand his attention to detail – no stone is left unturned in his quest for servicing perfection. Most of his jobs tend to be a full service or rebuild rather than specific component replacements, so he says the exact cost is absorbed in the job’s final total.</p>\n<p>Barse, Wallis and Watkins all charge an hourly rate, with Watkins saying it can’t be done by fixed cost anymore “unless you’re willing to lose money and take the hit”.</p>\n<p>He notes “customers are generally understanding when this information is presented clearly up-front, though not everyone understandably takes the news well”. In fact, all of the mechanics note a transparent dialogue with the customer is always of benefit.</p>\n<p>Watkins reminds customers their “top-end bike is designed for people who race them, who have parts replaced [by professional mechanics] before every event in some cases”.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinarello Dogma X in front of a red wall\" title=\"Pinarello Dogma X in front of a red wall\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Is integration really worth it, considering the increased service bill?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>As a result, it’s worth considering whether the performance benefits of a fully integrated bike – and particularly those with notoriously complex ‘solutions’ – are worth it against the increased running costs. Watkins likens this to owning a Ferrari, where “the cost of the car simply represents the initial deposit. Running and keeping it as new is what breaks you”.</p>\n<p>Pre-sale education is key here, too. Barse says there is “a common theme of neglect by the sales floor to educate the customer on the actual cost of integrated systems”.</p>\n<p>This can be a thorny issue, given that bike shops need to remain profitable to survive, and many brands are consumer-direct now anyway and thus bypass a traditional shop floor. However, the message for the customer remains the same – know what you are letting yourself in for if you do opt for an integrated bike.</p>\n<p>Barse would also like to see improvements in brand documentation to help mechanics working on specific systems, such as “a universal library for service and technical bulletins”.</p>\n<p>This is a view shared by Dubash, who says he spends hours trawling through manufacturers’ documents and occasionally phones the component distributor if he’s faced with something he doesn’t have experience with.</p>\n<h2>If you weren’t in charge of maintaining your own bike, would you opt for integration?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BMC ICS cockpit on BMC Teammachine SLR01 with Campagnolo Super Record EPS\" title=\"BMC ICS cockpit on BMC Teammachine SLR01 with Campagnolo Super Record EPS\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s no denying integrated systems look clean, when done right.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Despite our mechanics’ general aversion to integration, both Millard and Watkins would own an integrated bike if money were no object, due to the clean aesthetic. However, Watkins is keen to point out this would also be on the assumption he “had no mechanical knowledge” of the disadvantages.</p>\n<p>Wallis says he would also join the club if he was still racing, but doesn’t see the need for integration for any other cycling genre.</p>\n<p>Both Barse and Dubash were less certain, with Dubash explaining, “the only way integrated systems make sense is if electronic shifting and hydraulic disc brakes are used”. However, he questioned whether those are things any of us truly need on a bike.</p>\n<p>Barse says he “likes and appreciates some of the details a company can create for external housing stops or the fun challenge of clean cable routing for a tidy cockpit” but thinks many integrated bikes “look so similar to one another”.</p>\n<p>Whatever your thoughts, integration is here to stay, but one thing’s for sure – there is a long way to go in ensuring easier maintenance for riders and mechanics.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s in the form of a standardised internal cable routing system, headset bearings that don’t require servicing, simpler designs with clear literature for mechanics to follow, or simply better quality control, remains to be seen.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c3bfcdb8f6b5b82855f968bee462e811582bb7328e1e975edebb191741b01cff","category":"Cycling"}
