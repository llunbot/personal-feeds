Rollout has been slow since the support was announced in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-shares-us-states-adopting-wallet-ids/\">September 2021</a>, with Ohio last week becoming only the fifth state to add support, following Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia. The California DMV received permission to start testing mobile driver's licenses and ID cards with a limited number of people soon after Apple announced the support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you live in one of the five supported states, you can add your state ID card to iPhone by opening the Wallet app and tapping the + button. After selecting your state ID, simply scan the front and back of the physical card, then send a photo of yourself to the state DMV for additional verification. IDs and licenses stored in the Wallet app can be used in select U.S. airports at TSA checkpoints.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Jimmy!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/iphone-drivers-license-support-coming-california/\">iPhone Driver's License Support Coming Soon to California</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-drivers-license-support-coming-soon-to-california.2432968/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"738dec95ba9232057b372d14c71875e9ed248c0053d3ece485e050d4a50338a7","category":"Apple"}
