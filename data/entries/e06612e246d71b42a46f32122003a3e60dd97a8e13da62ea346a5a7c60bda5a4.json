Born and raised in Northern California, Nick cut his teeth riding BMX and gravity-focused dirt, while also experimenting with moto-cross until injuries forced him to take engine-driven sports out of the equation. The son of auto-repair shop owners, he learned his way around a workshop early as he and his brothers “always had rock crawlers and track cars” and weekends and after school were “[spent] in the shop working on our own stuff, working on my cars, building roll cages.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-42.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Mods and swaps that might seem absurdly involved for the hobbyist tinkerer were family projects, and learning experiences, for Nick and his dad: “One of my fondest memories is he didn’t have space for me in the shop to do a solid axle swap on a pickup truck that I bought when I was in highschool so we ended up going down [to the shop] in the pickup, got all the tools we needed, cut everything off the frame rail in a completely not-flat driveway and somehow welded everything back together straighter than when it was stock. So, I’ve always just been exposed to that world and it’s always fascinated me; I’ve always liked to make things.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-41.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Before bicycles, Nick’s mechanical curiosities led him to work for a motorcycle race team where he did suspension and chassis design work. Today, Nick sees parallels in that back-and-forth builder to engineer feedback loop and the processes he and Daniel employ at Neuhaus; “I’d go to the race track and help tune the bikes, get back to the engineers and tell them what needed to be made. Not all that different from the setup we’ve established here: taking notes from the real world and passing it off to Daniel (in this case), and the engineering team previously, and in a couple weeks be handed some more parts with the instructions to let them know how it goes.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-32.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Daniel got into the full-range of cycling experiences in college and graduate school—riding road, track, and mountain bikes—while studying mechanical engineering. He worked as an engineer in additive manufacturing before he got caught up in tech layoffs, which allowed him to channel his passion into building bikes full time. He was actually a Neuhaus customer before becoming half of the operation, and asked Nick to build him a bike that closely resembles the Solstice model they offer today. It’s easy to see how Daniel’s unbridled enthusiasm for engineering and model-driven design would have sparked early conversations between him and Nick. Regarding how he sees the connection between bikes and engineering, Daniel says, “I eat and breath engineering —for me, one of the joys of cycling is the connection between the human body, the machine that you’re riding, and the terrain that you’re riding on. Being able to design frames is cool because you can visualize the feelings that you want to have while riding and then design a bike to suit that.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-47.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The two make a complementary co-working pair; Nick’s views are well-considered, he is polished in speech, and deliver’s sound bytes with a marketer’s precision while Daniel’s effervescent, nerdy fervor around all things data, modeling, and 3D printing brings big start-up energy to the operation.

But like the best makers’ spaces, everything feels purposeful; everything has a story.</p>\n<p>Gesturing towards the tubing backstock, Nick explains how they keep extra inventory to a minimum, “Everything we use is 4130 chromoly; front triangles are generally a combination of normal 4130 chromoly butted tubes and heat-treated tubes, depending on the size, location, etc… We partner with Bike Fab Supply (Andrew Cooper) and generally he’ll sell the tubes we design and he’ll also house the overstock. So, instead of [us] having to find a place to put 200 tubes, he’ll sit on them, sell them as people need them, and we can [also] buy them from him as needed.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/04/NeuhausMetalworks_Speed.mp4\">https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/04/NeuhausMetalworks_Speed.mp4</a></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The shop has two frame fixtures (“Todd Farr built one of these,”) setup so that Nick can have two projects going at once and the space also houses two mills. Nick bought the Bridgeport (“1970-something?”) off a machine shop that actually used to make parts for Fox Factory; it didn’t make bike suspension parts but it did make truck suspension parts. At Neuhaus, it’s responsible for gravel bike chainstays and it holds a tubing bender that Nick uses for some bridges. That’s about it, currently, but Nick added a hint of things to come, “that will change in the near future as we start introducing some additional models.” At the time of our visit, their All-Road Proto had yet to be unveiled, but you can find photos of this newly-announced work in progress in our recent Sea Otter coverage!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-7.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>“This machine probably does the majority of the work in the shop,” said Nick, pointing to the mitering machine, “ [it’s] set up for all the main tube mitering; it does the chainstay mitering; we do the seat stays on it.” And, of course, he continued with the story behind it, “It is also probably the most unique machine in the shop: this actually came from Ibis when Ibis was located in Santa Rosa so in the very, early beginning days of Ibis and Scot Nicol, this made thousands of those steel and titanium Ibis frames….I can set a stop a stand here for hours doing the same thing over and over and aggravate the carpal tunnel that I didn’t used to have. This machine was built in 1909 and I can say with absolute confidence that it is the most accurate machine in this shop—it is also the heaviest. The published weight without the electric motor conversion which was done in the 1950s was about 4,700lbs, so we figure with the motor it’s close to 5,000lbs.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-25.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-24.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Next, Nick pointed out the lathe (“very similar to the one they’ve got over there at Dean”) which mostly gets used for cleaning tubes. The second mill, “is the most boring machine in the shop,” according to Nick “but is also probably the second-most used. It’s a knock-off of a Bridgeport step-pulley mill, I use it as a glorified drill press (vent holes in BB shells and seat tubes).” The welder—an inverter machine—is, fittingly, his favorite. As Nick admits, “It was a splurge purchase—it’s more than I’ll ever need, it maxes out at 400 amps which I think is good for welding a half-inch plate, which is 50x over the thickest part of a bicycle frame.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt

They currently offer two mountain bike models: the Solstice 29 hardtail is positioned as an “all-arounder that’s lively on the climbs and stable on the chunk” designed around 130mm of travel (120mm for size small), while the Hummingbird is “our progressive XC/Trail mountain bike.

Better still, Daniel and Nick are committed to giving riders the same experience in handling and compliance across the size range, from those on XL frames to XS.

The reason a lot of the stock bikes are [made] the way they are is based on what’s commercially available and what’s manufacturable for these larger operations.

However, as Hailey outlines above, it features several 3D-printed components in key frame junctions. The seat tube cluster and chainstay yoke are the fingerprints that identify it as a Neuhaus when compared to other bikes on the market. Little details stand out like how slammed the head tube is to the fork, the raised seat tube bottle boss bridge that allows for the use of a Voile cargo strap, and perhaps my favorite: the dropper port nipple.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-63.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Inside-Out-at-Neuhaus-Metalworks-82.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>In terms of riding characteristics, like many builders, Neuhaus is inspired by its local trails and the sorts of rides Daniel and Nick partake on.
