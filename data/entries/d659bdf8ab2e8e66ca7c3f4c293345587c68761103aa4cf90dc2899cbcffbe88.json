Pedal bikes had taken a backseat to motorcycles, as I had my hands full keeping our small stable of vintage motorcycles running—mainly 1970-80s scramblers and enduros. During the pandemic, however, our local dirt bike trails closed down, and I found myself climbing the walls, crazed for a way back into the woods.</p>\n<p>In the summer of ‘21, my girlfriend and I did a big trip out west in our ’96 GMC van, “Bruiser,” where we spent several days broken down in Silver City, New Mexico.<span>  </span>One of the mechanics at Gila Hike and Bike had a 70s Suzuki very similar to the 1978 Yamaha we kept strapped to our van—a bike that became our primary mode of transportation while Bruiser was in the shop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1992\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?w=1992&amp;quality=75 1992w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?resize=768,514&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?resize=1800,1205&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Skidaway-Special-2.jpg?resize=1536,1028&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Talking to those guys about the riding they did out there, both on bicycles and motorcycles, got my mind running again along pedal bike lines.<span>  </span>I didn’t hear the name Monē while we were out there, but perhaps some magic klunker dust was floating in the atmosphere…</p>\n<p>When we got home to Savannah, I delved deep into the lore of Klunkerdom and early MTB history, with William Savage’s <i>Klunkerz</i>, Frank Berto’s <i>The Birth of Dirt</i>, and maestros like Cjell Monē as guides and inspiration.</p>\n<p>I bought a State Klunker, converted it to fixed-gear, nicknamed it the “Hosscat,” and raced it in the Blythe Island TT that fall.

Meanwhile, the new fork’s internal butting wouldn’t allow the stem to seat low enough, so I shortened the quill with an angle grinder to get it down to the height I wanted.<span>  </span>A 7/8” flex hone and power drill were used to clean up the seat tube enough for the post to go in.</p>\n<p>With a bottom bracket height of just over 10 inches—nearly two inches shorter than my State and Hank klunkers—I went with 155mm Sunday Saker BMX cranks for maximum pedal clearance, and I decided to keep the bike single-speed, not fixed, to avoid pedal strike.</p>\n<p>I would make adjustments each night, then take the bike out each morning on the same trails to test the differences, experimenting with a 24/26” mullet setup versus the 26” rear wheel, as well as different fork lengths, handlebar rises, gear ratios, tires—this Schwinn klunker taught me more about two-wheeled geometry than any motorcycle has.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it carried me out to see the same red fox every few days on the trails, along with raccoons, opossums, armadillos, and whitetail deer bounding beneath the Spanish moss of the island’s old gothic oaks.<span>  </span>I tried to be out there right at dawn, so I could stop on one of the river bluffs to see the rising sun flow like lava across the blackwater creeks of the salt marsh.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1980\" height=\"1333\"

pandemic crushing sales of my fourth novel, <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250203816\"><span><i>Pride of Eden</i></span></a>, I found my pedal-powered Zen.<span>  </span>There was something in the flow of the trails that seemed so similar to writing for me, too—that strange balance of faith and drive, trusting the front wheel to find traction among the fallen leaves and pine straw and roots, like searching for the thread of truth buried in a story.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I went on a bicycle reading tear, consuming everything from Tim Krabbe’s fabulous novel <i>The Rider</i> to Paul Fournel’s lovely essays in <i>Need for the Bike</i> to Jody Rosen’s cultural history <i>Two Wheels Good </i>to Joe Parkin’s European racing memoir <i>A Dog in a Hat</i> to Guy Martin’s autobiographies detailing his experiences on the Tour Divide—I could write a whole bibliography to accompany this reportage!</p>\n<p>In March, our local SORBA (Southern Off-road Bicycle Association) chapter put on an annual “Marsh Madness” race on Skidaway Island.<span>  </span>I signed myself up for the seven-mile sprint division, just hoping the ‘54 could survive the entire distance—and hell, I reckoned it would be fun to show up to a SORBA-sanctioned race on a 34.6-lb rigid single-speed klunker with drum brakes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2025\"

with gears, disc brakes, and front or full suspension.<span>  </span>When the flag dropped, I sprinted like a madman, surprised to find myself moving toward the head of the pack, only to lose the front tire on an early berm and wipe out.<span>  </span>I’d been too hurried, feeling the other riders chomping at my heels.<span>  </span>By the time I leapt back in the saddle, I’d slid down in the
