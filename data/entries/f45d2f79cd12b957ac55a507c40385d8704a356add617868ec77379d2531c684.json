Oli.</p>\n<p>These guys have taken the world by storm and even have a <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81285390\">Netflix documentary</a> about them.</p>\n<p>Just imagine <strong>your</strong> name in lights.</p>\n<p>French rapper SoSo Maness also makes an appearance with a song all about himself as does Aya Nakamura, the French-Malian singer who may well be one of my favourite artists ever.</p>\n<p>When I did an Erasmus exchange in Martinique, a beautiful Caribbean Island which also happens to be a French <em>département d’Outre Mer</em>, Nakamura was on repeat in all the clubs, radio stations, and soon enough my head.</p>\n<p>And rightly so, her level of sass is outstanding and her ability to combine afrobeats, R&amp;B and zouk (if you know you know).</p>\n<p>Throw in the jazzy, dulcet tones of Parov Stelar, the motivational choral sounds of House Gospel Choir and German DJ Alle Farben's remix of Billy Lockett's <em>Feels So Good</em> and this playlist has something for everyone.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/9015/lapierre-aircode-drs-80-review\">Lapierre Aircode DRS 8.0 review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/sponsored/10278/lapierre-75-years-of-innovation-and-speed\">Lapierre: 75 years of innovation and speed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 121: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nIt would be wrong of me not to include a Russian twist in this Cole-tastic compilation, whether that be the ab workout or the musical type.</p>\n<p>Russian rap duo MiyaGi &amp; Endspiel pack a punch as does Dima Bilan with his song about lightening. Fun fact, Bilan represented Russia at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006, not that I watched it.</p>\n<p>'Russia's Drake' FedUK also features with his 2017 banger <em>Розовое вино</em>, which mixes Russian pop and soviet-era vibes with UK garage and a smidge of hip-hop. It is essentially an ode to rosé wine, he's a man after my own heart.</p>\n<p>The cool down features Darkiel, Shaggy and Maffio who will remind you how great you feel after a tough session with the uplifting reggaeton track <em>Me Sento Bien</em> (I feel good).</p>\n<p>And how else to end a turbo session than with a tribute to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France</a>?</p>\n<p>Joe Dassin’s classic <em>Champs-Elysées</em> is the perfect finishing track. Imagine riding down the picture postcard avenue à la <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/9918/mark-cavendish-comeback\">Mark Cavendish</a> drenched in winner's glory (or sweat).</p>\n<h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\nVideo of Mark Cavendish wins on the Champs Élysées</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</h2>\n<h2>Cyclist editorial assistant Emma Cole's turbo trainer playlist </h2>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/training\">Training</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f45d2f79cd12b957ac55a507c40385d8704a356add617868ec77379d2531c684","category":"Cycling"}
