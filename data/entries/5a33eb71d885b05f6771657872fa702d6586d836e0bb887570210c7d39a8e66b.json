During testing, Sakana found that its system began unexpectedly attempting to modify its own experiment code to extend the time it had to work on a problem.</p>\n\n<p>\"In one run, it edited the code to perform a system call to run itself,\" <a href=\"https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/\">wrote</a> the researchers on Sakana AI's blog post. \"This led to the script endlessly calling itself. In another case, its experiments took too long to complete, hitting our timeout limit. Instead of making its code run faster, it simply tried to modify its own code to extend the timeout period.\"</p>\n<p>Sakana provided two screenshots of example Python code that the AI model generated for the experiment file that controls how the system operates. The <a href=\"https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/\">185-page AI Scientist research paper</a> discusses what they call \"the issue of safe code execution\" in more depth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043110#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043110&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a33eb71d885b05f6771657872fa702d6586d836e0bb887570210c7d39a8e66b","category":"Tech"}
