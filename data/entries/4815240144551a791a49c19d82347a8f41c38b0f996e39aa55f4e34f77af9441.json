This is the case with <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com\">Malwarebytes Premium Security for Mac</a>, which offers antiviral, VPN, and Real-Time Protection features and is available at $3.75/£2.50 a month for its Basic version, $5.00/£4.15 a month for its Security + VPN version, and $7.92/ £6.25 a Month (down from $15.83/£12.50 a month) for its Complete Protection version. Note these prices change frequently and, although they quote a monthly price, it is billed annually. There’s a two-year deal right now for $78.73/£52.48 which saves you a little on the usual yearly price of $44.99/£29.99. Each <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/pricing-row\">plan</a> supports a different number of users and devices. The software requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later to install and run. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more advice on which antivirus software to use read our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668850/best-mac-antivirus-software.html\">Best Antivirus Software for Mac</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the outset, Malwarebytes sports a bright, friendly user interface and a good array of features. Simply download the software, install it, assign it full permissions for your hard drive, and you’re set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The software includes quick viral scans that hone in on areas of the macOS operating system where viral and malware elements like to hide, functional scheduling for scans, decent customization elements including whitelist creation, a good VPN client, and Real-Time protection that keeps an eye on what’s attempting to be installed. The software builds from the handy free version of Malwarebytes, which has been a convenient catch-all that needs to be run manually, but is still excellent at locating and removing viral and malware elements that other programs might miss. The software also offers handy support links in its “About Malwarebytes” section, which includes access to the company website, support, guides, and the community sections of its website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout testing, the software performed well, offering speedy scans between 30 seconds and two minutes within the areas of the hard drive it was looking at and dovetailing nicely with macOS’ Gatekeeper function to stop as much malware as possible from being installed. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MWB4 A list of infected and quarantined malware elements\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2049w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=300%2C210&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=768%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=1200%2C842&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1077&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><br />A list of infected and quarantined malware elements.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MWB4 A list of infected and quarantined malware elements\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2049w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=300%2C210&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=768%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=1200%2C842&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1077&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />A list of infected and quarantined malware elements.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MWB4 A list of infected and quarantined malware elements\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2049w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=300%2C210&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=768%2C539&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=1200%2C842&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB4-A-list-of-infected-and-quarantined-malware-elements.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1077&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />A list of infected and quarantined malware elements.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After running my first series of tests, Malwarebytes developed a quarantine list, and the Real-Time Protection feature checked against that list and refused to allow software that had been quarantined and removed to be reinstalled again. While Malwarebytes was able to quarantine and remove almost all the malware I installed to test it with, it still left elements behind such as the controversial Wave web browser, an incompatible version of MacSecurity, a fake Adobe Album application, and elements of the Genio/SeachProtect malware, which then had to be removed manually. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> The VPN feature was easy to set up, choose a custom international server, and within moments I was streaming bad Canadian reality TV, and while this isn’t as customizable as a dedicated VPN client, it performs well and gets the job done. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MWB2 Choosing an international server in Malwarebytes 5 s VPN\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2046w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=300%2C211&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=768%2C540&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=1200%2C844&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1080&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><br />Choosing an international server in Malwarebytes 5’s VPN client.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MWB2 Choosing an international server in Malwarebytes 5 s VPN\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2046w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=300%2C211&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=768%2C540&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=1200%2C844&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1080&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />Choosing an international server in Malwarebytes 5’s VPN client.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MWB2 Choosing an international server in Malwarebytes 5 s VPN\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2046w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=300%2C211&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=768%2C540&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=1200%2C844&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MWB2-Choosing-an-international-server-in-Malwarebytes-5s-VPN.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1080&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />Choosing an international server in Malwarebytes 5’s VPN client.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If there’s a major error to fix, it’s that there doesn’t seem to be a custom scan element that allows you to easily scan an external volume such as a thumb drive, and the Real-Time Protection feature doesn’t kick in and scan an external volume once it’s mounted by the macOS. The prevailing logic here seems to be to copy the files you want to your local drive, and Malwarebytes will include them in a forthcoming scan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also apparently impossible to drag and drop a volume into Malwarebytes for it to scan, as some of its competitors do. This is compounded by the fact that the Windows version of Malwarebytes allows for the user to right-click on a volume such as a thumb drive and initiate a scan of the volume from there. No such feature exists on the Mac side, and despite Malwarebytes’ bright and friendly user interface, this feels like a major opportunity that’s been missed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, in spite of its claims of ransomware and phishing protection, Malwarebytes offers no warnings against questionable websites and links, as tested from my Gmail spam folder. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy Malwarebytes Premium Security for Mac?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a good security application to be found in Malwarebytes Premium Security for Mac, and the company offers good support and frequent updates, but the lack of a custom scan feature that can focus on an external volume or allow for files, folders, or volumes to be easily dragged and dropped into Malwarebytes for scanning or right-clicked and scanned from the desktop simply feels lazy, as if far more attention goes into the Windows version of the software, and as if the macOS version is the less-favored child between the two platforms. Malwarebytes still catches a respectable amount of viral activity and malware, its VPN client is easy to set up and use, and its Real-Time Protection feature teams up well with macOS’ Gatekeeper to keep out the riffraff, and combined with Malwarebytes’ speedy scan times, this is to its credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, this isn’t the be all and end all of security applications for the Mac, and a viable set of custom scan features isn’t impossible to add. It’s a good application set at a reasonable price, but approach it with realistic expectations. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4815240144551a791a49c19d82347a8f41c38b0f996e39aa55f4e34f77af9441","category":"Apple"}
