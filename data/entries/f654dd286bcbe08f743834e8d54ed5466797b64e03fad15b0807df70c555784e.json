I’ve spent three weeks\ntesting the system’s “near-final” hardware ahead of preorders\nopening up on 1 pm ET on Thursday, July 29, and I can confirm\nthat it’s indeed fun to look at. Luckily, it’s also fun, simple,\nand accessible to hold, play with, and share with every friend\nthat I can.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Andrew Webster at The Verge got an early look too, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview\">had a similar reaction</a>.
