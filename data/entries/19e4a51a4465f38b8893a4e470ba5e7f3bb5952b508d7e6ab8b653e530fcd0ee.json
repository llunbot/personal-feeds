The headlining title is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/\"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, an indie hit that combined the gameplay of bullet hell shooters and the addictive quality of clickers to become a mega sensation two years ago. Also coming is <em>Temple Run: Legends</em>, an updated take on the popular game from 2011.</p>\n<p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was already available on the App Store, but it was ad-supported, with the option to spend money in-app to get additional content. The Apple Arcade version, dubbed <em>Vampire Survivors+</em>, is more akin to the PC or Xbox versions that don't have ads. Both paid expansions will be included at no additional charge.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Temple Run: Legends</em> is a completely new game (not just a remake of the original <em>Temple Run</em>) that bucks the \"endless runner\" genre label by breaking its gameplay into individual levelsâ€”though there will be some kind of optional endless mode, too.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036212#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036212&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19e4a51a4465f38b8893a4e470ba5e7f3bb5952b508d7e6ab8b653e530fcd0ee","category":"Tech"}
