It has a gorgeous Liquid Retina display flanked by incredibly slim bezels, and its thin and light design makes it easy to slip into a bag or backpack. You’ll also get a speedy M2 processor, all-day battery life, MagSafe for fast charging, and a pair of Thunderbolt ports. And of course, it’s running Sonoma and will get updates for years to come.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we praised the “absolutely excellent processor” and “bright, sharp, and colorful” display, and loved the surprisingly affordable price. And at this discount, it’s nearly impossible to pass up.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f4d1490460c83eb8853ec00f970584a38e6c3b4a00a86507b79ffd2f01a754cd","category":"Apple"}
