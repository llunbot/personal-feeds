Through its sprawling network of services and research initiatives, Google is the first to spot many of these threats. In a new report from the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), the company reveals it detected 75 zero-day <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/google-patches-its-fifth-zero-day-vulnerability-of-the-year-in-chrome/\">exploits in 2024</a>, which is a bit lower than the previous year. Unsurprisingly, a sizable chunk of them was the work of state-sponsored hackers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2024-zero-day-trends\">According to Google</a>, zero-day exploits are becoming increasingly easy for threat actors to develop and procure, which has led to more sophisticated attacks. While end-user devices are still regularly targeted, GTIG notes that the trend over the past few years has been for these vulnerabilities to target enterprise systems and security infrastructure. There were 98 zero-days detected in 2023 versus 75 in 2024, but Google says the overall trend in enterprise threats is increasing.</p>\n<p>That's not to say the products you use every day are safe from sneaky hacksâ€”a slim majority of GTIG's 2024 zero-day threats still targeted users. In fact, Google says hackers were even more interested in certain platforms last year compared to the year before.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/google-governments-are-using-zero-day-hacks-more-than-ever/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/google-governments-are-using-zero-day-hacks-more-than-ever/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e6ab56ce052dfae9df6a28b786e0495e99474407ad0c1ff95c98f18d06819028","category":"Tech"}
