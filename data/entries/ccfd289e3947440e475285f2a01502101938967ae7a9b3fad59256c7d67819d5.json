With December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year, achieved all time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by growth from ‌iPad‌ and Mac. Thanks for our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our install base of active devices, reached an all time high across all products and geographic segments, and is now over 2.35 billion active devices.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProducts gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially. Services margin was 75%, up 100 basis points thanks to mix. Gross margin was 46.9 overall, up 70bp.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:16 pm</b>: This strong business performance resulted in all time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year over year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:17 pm</b>: ‌iPhone‌ \"grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe and Japan, and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia. The ‌iPhone‌ active install base grew to an all time high in total and in every geographic segment. It also set an all time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, ‌iPhone‌ was a top selling model in the US or in China as well as the UK, France, Australia and Japan. The company continues to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the US at 96% as measured by 451 Research.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:18 pm</b>: \"Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year over year. We saw strength across our lineup, from the new Mac Mini to the latest ‌MacBook Air‌ and ‌MacBook Pro‌ models. This incredible performance was broad based with double digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac install base reached an all time high, and we saw a double digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the US was recently measured at 94%.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:18 pm</b>: \"‌iPad‌ revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year over year, driven by the new ‌iPad‌ Mini and latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, the ‌iPad‌ install base reached another all time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an ‌iPad‌ during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the US. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:19 pm</b>: \"Wearables, home and accessories, revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year over year. Customers are excited about the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a> and the latest hearing health features in ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 and Watch, although we face a difficult compare against Apple Watch Ultra2 launch last year, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for Watch in the US was reported at 94%.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:20 pm</b>: \"Services revenue reached an all time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our install base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings, both transacting and paid accounts, reached new all time highs with paid accounts growing double digits year over year, paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over a billion paid subscriptions across the Services.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:21 pm</b>: Apple has $141 billion in cash and marketable securities after repaying $1 billion in maturing debt, and decreasing commercial paper by $8 billion. $97 billion in total debt, with net cash of $45 billion after returning more than $30 billion to shareholders through $3.9 billion in dividends and $23.3 billion in open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:22 pm</b>: FX headwinds expected to continue to be a challenge, an impact on revenue of 2.5% year over year. March quarter revenue is expected to grow low to mid single digits year over year. Services revenue expected to grow low single digits year over year, with a year over year growth rate comparable to the December quarter except for FX challenges. Gross margin between 46.5 and 47.5, with operating expenses between $15.1 and $15.3 billion. Expected tax rate around 16%.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:22 pm</b>: Dividend of $0.25 per share payable on February 13.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:24 pm</b>: Q: In your prepared remarks, you noted <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models were selling better in markets where ‌Apple Intelligence‌ are available. Can you help us understand that how it's impacting ‌iPhone‌ demand and what features are users using most often already?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: We did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence that the year over year performance on the ‌iPhone 16‌ family was stronger than those where Apple intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using. They're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments, from writing tools to image playground and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> to visual intelligence and and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe only had two and a half weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of 18.2, and then only had the UK and the other English language countries for the two and a half weeks. And so we've got, you know, just the early indications at the moment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:27 pm</b>: Q: On China, can you talk about headwinds that Apple faces, is it shifting preferecnes for Western technology in favor of domestic ventors or is it function of not having ‌Apple Intelligence‌ or replacement cycles?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: If you look at Greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year over year. Over half of the decline we experienced was driven by a change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. On the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ side we have not rolled out in China, we saw better results we rolled out in than markets we had not. It's also the most competitive market in the world. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in December, but the national program was announced in January. It does cover products in categories we have up to a maximum price point, we do see fiscal stimulus occuring and will be glad to talk about what that's looking like on the next call.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:28 pm</b>: Q: Asking about the DeekSeek situation and the potential for costs to come down as Apple is a big beneficiary of lower cost compute.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: Innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing in general and that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software will continue to serve us very well. We do things on the device and the private cloud which mimics, from an architectural point of view, what happens on the device. From a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach and we continue to leverage a hybrid model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: With regard to the ‌iPhone‌ trajectory, you don't talk about new products but do you feel like there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future or is the current lineup showing where you're going? I'm wondering if you think, in terms of phone innovation, is there a lot more to come? Do you see the current market changing over the next few years?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our current product pipeline. There's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:31 pm</b>: Q: Was encouraging to hear about the record for ‌iPhone‌ upgraders. What do you attribute this to? Was ‌Apple Intelligence‌ playing a role in the markets you've launched in?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: We've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The install base hit a new all-time high as well and if you look at the 16 compared to the 15, from launch which occurred in September, so across two quarters, the 16 outperformed the 15. I think you can conclude from that there are compelling reasons to upgrade and in the markets where we've launched ‌Apple Intelligence‌, they outperformed markets where we did not. Lots of good color there.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:32 pm</b>: Q: On the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> M4, can you talk about that thin form factor for the ‌iPad Pro‌? How did it help ‌iPad‌ sales overall and what did your marketing and consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: It's a good question. ‌iPad‌ overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by ‌iPad Air‌ and the entry-level ‌iPad‌ than the top-level ‌iPad‌. Overall, we could not be more pleased with the ‌iPad‌ category growing 15%, it's a great achievement for the quarter and probably what is most important is that more than half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the ‌iPad‌. There's still a good amount of customers to attract there.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:34 pm</b>: Q: Seeing robust growth trends in emerging markets right now, do you think some of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or growing fast enough to offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: We have great results in a number of emerging markets, I'm particularly keen on India and we're opening more stores there after setting a December quarter record. The ‌iPhone‌ was the top-selling model in India for the quarter and it's the second-largest smartphone market in the world and third-largest for PCs and tablets. It's a huge market and we have very modest share in these markets and I think there's lots of upside there and that's just one of the emerging markets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEmerging markets we're also seeing double digit growth on the install base in total and for the ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: On gross margins for March, you're guiding flat. Usually you go up, is it all FX?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: We're guiding to 46.5-47.5, we're pleased with that level. There's always puts and takes, there will be FX headwinds that will affect revenue and margin, but it's offset by favorable costs and mix of services. Also, moving from Q1 to Q2, we do have a loss of leverage. We feel good about the range and it's a strong guide for gross margin.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: You mentioned channel inventory in China. Do you feel like they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? Is this a normal progression into the March quarter?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: On a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with channel inventory position, in China, our channel inventory reduced from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and that was more than half of the reduction in reported results. Part of the reason is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be towards the end of the quarter, so we ended a little leaner than we expected to.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:38 pm</b>: Q: Servies growth has been strong but you've been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens. Do you think there's a top line or margin headwind that your'e currently absorbing that could potentially reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: We set an all-time record for Services, up 14%, and we have a broad services portfolio and we have great momentum across the board. We have a billion paid subscriptions across the Services platform.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:40 pm</b>: Q: You had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both. And I'm just curious in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double digit growth that you saw in both the product lines?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: Mac was up 16% and ‌iPad‌ up 15%, strong uptake on new products during the quarter. Launched M4-based ‌MacBook Pro‌, ‌iMac‌ and Mac Mini during the quarter. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a> is designed for these workloads, but I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the ‌iPad‌ for the quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:41 pm</b>: Q: Re India being a strong and emerging market, to ask about supply chain planning there, how much is a growth expectation to that market vs diversification of the supply chain in that country?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market and we export, so our business needs certain economies of scale to have it make sense to manufacture in country so it means we're going to need both a use for domestic market and export market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:45 pm</b>: Q: How do we square ‌iPhone‌ momentum with the gross margin profile and ‌Apple Intelligence‌ as a momentum driver for ‌iPhone‌? Where do you think Services margin could go from here being at 75%?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: Markets where we rolled out ‌Apple Intelligence‌ performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we hadn't. That gives us a positive indicator that we were pleased with. The other thing I would say, if you look at it from a launch to the end of the Dec. quarter, that goes back to Sept., the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April, and so it will be in our Q3 quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRe gross margin, Services margin is accretive to overall company margins, but we have a large services portfolio and they have wide gross margins. Payment services and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> are growing and when we add incremental users they are accretive to margins. What we expect on a company level is 46.5 to 47.5 and we think that's a strong guide.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:46 pm</b>: Q: How much of the Mac growth is normal replacement cycle versus ‌Apple Silicon‌ innovation?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: I think it's a combination of these products being so compelling that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and driving switchers at a double-digit level. We're seeing both come out and I think it's just because of compelling products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: On product gross margin, how much room do you have to improve or with AI related devices is there more room to grow or not?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: We had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points driven by favorable mix and leverage in Q1, it's a launch quarter for many products and we get leverage from higher volume. Our gross margin for products is driven by many factors, many products have different marging profiles and mix makes a difference. Many of our mix across phone, we see people gravitating towards our Pro products. Customers get into our best products and they have favorable gross margin. That trend impacted us and we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint and benefited in the December quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe'll have a FX headwind heading into the March quarter and that's included in the guidance we gave.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: What might accelerate the pace of ‌Apple Intelligence‌ adoption and is this time to launch more markets and languages or installed base, or is it about shifting marketing spend or R&amp;D towards AI? Will there be a tipping point where adoption goes mainstream?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: I think it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today and this is, keep in mind that on the ‌iPhone‌ side of our business, you either have to have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro or any ‌iPhone 16‌ to use ‌Apple Intelligence‌. As that base grows, usage will continue to grow. Once you start using the features, you can't imagin not using them anymore. I get 100s of emails a day and the summarization function is so important.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nI think it's a combination of that and in April we roll out a whole series of new languages that you had mentioned and the base grows further.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was getting Apple to record margin levels and maintaining consistent pricing across the product range. What observations can you share about price sensitivity of users and if having a wider range of pricing might unlock potentially further market share or boost overall product growth?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: I don't think we're gonna really depart from what served us pretty well until now. We always take into consideration looking at comparisons between short term and long term, I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy which was served us pretty well. And I think we're going to kind of stick with that.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: How do you you see any potential tariff impact under Trump 2.0 after you did fine under Trump 1.0?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: We are monitoring the situation and don't have any more than that.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: There's a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Upgraded <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> is coming in April, what do you think of that?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: I think the killer feature is different for different people and I think for most, they'll find they're going to use many of the features every day. One of those is ‌Siri‌ and that will be coming over the next several months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>2:53 pm</b>: Q: Thinking about the average useful life of these devices in the wild, the strong results you saw in 2021, how might that support opportunity in the future?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA: It depends on different types of users.
