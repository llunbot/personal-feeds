These bikes are made in the USA and have been selling like hot cakes over the past several months, so when it came time to list them on <a href=\"https://ronsbikes.com/products/aluminus-maximus?variant=47794132222227\" target=\"_blank\">RonsBikes.com</a>, Arya and Ronnie only had sizes 51 cm and 60 cm left. So if you have short legs or long legs, they’ve gotcha covered.</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to remind everyone that Arya and Ronnie lost their factory and means of primary income last year and it’s been hard on the brand. So if you have any free money and would like to see Ron’s Bikes grow, check out their <a href=\"https://ronsbikes.com/collections/in-stock-today\" target=\"_blank\">in-stock-today</a> items and throw them some love.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rons-bikes-aluminus-maximus-frames/\">Ron’s Bikes Aluminus Maximus Frames</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9244881c9f34234ca7fceafbb1fdf3dc32b25cccbb52dec28e445c229014b3d5","category":"Cycling"}
