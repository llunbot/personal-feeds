These mystery boxes include one Anker accessory, but you won't know what you're getting until they arrive. All items in the $19.99 box are worth more than $19.99, and all items in the $29.99 box are worth more than $29.99, so no matter what you'll be getting a deal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll mystery box items are non-returnable (with the exception of quality issues).
