This mission launched seven years ago and has been in the planning and development phase for over a decade. To say the scientists who have fought for and executed this mission are anxious and excited is an understatement. But there is an additional frisson with OSIRIS-REx, as scientists are not entirely sure what they've been able to pull away from the asteroid.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956175#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956175&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"75d1112428155cb48a687474903e4047713580ac86bb5c3b1e836986cf63d524","category":"Tech"}
