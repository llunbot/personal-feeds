Well-executed and offering unsurpassed stability for bike-packing and road-touring applications, this rear on-bike storage system put Tailfin on the map and went largely unchanged until now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Tailfin has released updated versions of the AeroPack and AP18 that provide expandable cargo pockets, a faster single-buckle closure, additional mounting options for storage or hydration, and remain 100% compatible with existing Tailfin equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor.webp\" alt=\"A Tailfin rear on-bike cargo system on a Factor Ostro gravel.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinFactor-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>Tailfin systems keep your gear stable and out of the wind.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest AeroPack Cargo and AP18 Cargo will sit in the Tailfin range alongside the existing AeroPack and AP18 Top Bag, using Tailfin’s modular system to allow any current Tailfin user to easily upgrade. New Tailfin customers can purchase either the AeroPackCargo or AP18 Cargo, and because of Tailfin’s modular design, Aeropack buyers will have the ability to switch to the non-Cargo versions later on.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1601\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18.webp\" alt=\"The AP18 bag and Aeropack shown side-by-side on tow seperate bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AeropackAP18-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The AP18 (left) and Aeropack allow riders to choose how their Tailfin system functions.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most visible and compelling reason to choose the new Tailfin system or for existing users to upgrade is the addition of the external mesh cargo pockets. In much the same way that cargo bib shorts are essential to ultra-long distance riding and bike-packing, these pockets not only add capacity but also allow riders to keep things isolated that are wet, frequently accessed, or would otherwise contaminate the main storage compartment. According to Tailfin, the material used in the stretch pockets combines the perfect amount of stretch whilst being robust enough withstand abrasions from being leaned against a wall or a scraping against a bush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket.webp\" alt=\"A cyclist closes up his Tailfin AP18 using the compression strap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinExternalPocket-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The new Tailfin systems offer more capacity, better organization, beefed-up construction, and an easier user experience.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other tweaks and upgrades are less visible but also promise to enhance durability and user experience. A single-buckle closure system speeds up access to the main compartment and replaces the two extra buckles at the front or rear of the bag found on Tailfin’s current design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update, according to Tailfin, makes it easier to close the bag when fully packed. A single, adjustable-length TPU compression strap integrated into mesh pockets provides additional security for the cargo pockets’ contents and ensures easy and effective compression of the main compartment. Three carbon battens have been added to help retain the bag’s shape-preventing lateral bulging of the main compartment when stuffed full.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved.webp\" alt=\"A bike packer sits with his AP18 pack removed from his bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TailfinRemoved-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The AP18 can be easily removed when needed. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specifications </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 18 liter main pack (+ approximately 3 litres of expandable, external cargo pocket space)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Hypalon/Ripstop Nylon.
