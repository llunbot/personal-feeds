But Nintendo's legal takedown efforts have generally stayed away from emulation software itself.</p>\n<p>This weekend saw an exception to that rule, though, as Nintendo's lawyers formally asked Valve to cut off the planned Steam release of <a href=\"https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin\">Wii and Gamecube emulator Dolphin</a>. In <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023.05.26-Ltr-from-A.-Stein-to-Valve-re-Dolphin.pdf\">a letter addressed to the Valve Legal Department</a> (a copy of which was provided to Ars by the Dolphin Team), an attorney representing Nintendo of America requests that Valve take down Dolphin's \"coming soon\" Steam store page (which <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230328051627/https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941680/Dolphin_Emulator/\">originally went up in March</a>) and \"ensure the emulator does not release on the Steam store moving forward.\" The letter exerts the company's \"rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)’s Anti-Circumvention and Anti-Trafficking provisions,\" even though it doesn't take the form of a formal DMCA takedown request.</p>\n<p>In fighting a decision like this, an emulator maker would usually be able to point to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/how-the-demonization-of-emulation-devalues-gamings-heritage/\">some robust legal precedents</a> that protect emulation software as a general concept. But legal experts that spoke to Ars said that Nintendo's argument here might actually get around those precedents and present some legitimate legal problems for the Dolphin Team.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943266#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943266&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ea7d3e7a62e8432817982b1bf2c6d68ff9e22c75b81058e4405ea58aaab9d1f","category":"Tech"}
