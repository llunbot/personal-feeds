On the Pro models, the USB-C port is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/\">support at least USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3</a>, which would result in the devices having significantly faster data transfer speeds over a wired connection compared to existing iPhones with a Lightning port.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Action button:</strong> iPhone 15 Pro models are rumored to be equipped with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/iphone-15-pro-action-button-cads/\">customizable Action button</a> like the Apple Watch Ultra. The button would replace the Ring/Silent switch that has been included on every iPhone model since 2007.
