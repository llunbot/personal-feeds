Album booklets offer multi-language liner notes, composer biographies, information about the orchestra, conductors, and soloists, plus where relevant, sung texts and opera libretti, enriching listeners' understanding of the music.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen a booklet is available for an album you've selected, you'll see an open book icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Tapping that will download the booklet, which can be viewed by using zoom gestures and scrolled to reveal more content. In addition to album booklets, version 2.0 also adds a new Recently Added section to the Library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Music‌ Classical app offers ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers access to over five million classical music tracks, including new high-quality releases, in addition to hundreds of curated playlists, thousands of exclusive albums, and other features like composer bios and deep dives on key works.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app offers a simpler interface for interacting with classical music specifically.
