This is the third update with Crash Detection optimizations after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/30/apple-releases-ios-16-1-2/\">iOS 16.1.2 in November</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/13/apple-releases-ios-16-3-1/\">iOS 16.3.1 last month</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCrash Detection launched last year for all iPhone 14 models and the latest Apple Watch models. The feature is designed to detect a severe car crash and automatically call emergency services if a user does not respond to the device within 20 seconds, but has sometimes mistaken a skier or snowboarder falling down as a car crash, according to reports out of Colorado, Utah, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and other popular skiing areas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if the latest optimizations will fully resolve the issue. The skiing season is drawing to a close in the U.S. and Canada, so we will have to wait until next winter in order to know if iOS 16.4 leads to a reduction in false 911 calls.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/22/ios-16-4-crash-detection-optimizations/\">iOS 16.4 Further Optimizes iPhone 14's Crash Detection After False 911 Calls</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-16-4-further-optimizes-iphone-14s-crash-detection-after-false-911-calls.2384436/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e28f010e00f80a72727b4f37d53cec2df898c1a37d5cb92a09b4d0eb41c77db2","category":"Apple"}
