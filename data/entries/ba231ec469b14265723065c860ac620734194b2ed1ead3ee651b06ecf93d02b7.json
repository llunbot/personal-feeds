Yet with the announcement of Chumba’s in-house titanium manufacturing earlier this year, Mark and Vince, the owners of Chumba, wanted to get Alexandera on some new frames. You might recall our coverage of the Sendero Titanium from this year’s <a href=\"http://theradavist.com/2021/06/the-2021-enve-builder-round-up-chumba-falconer-firefly-mariposa-scarab-sklar-tomii/\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE Builder Round Up.</a> After the show, I reached out to Chumba to see if they’d share some photos of Alexandera’s new bikes, so let’s check them out below…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Alexandera-Houchin-Terlingua-Titanium-Custom-Chumba-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Terlingua </strong><strong>Titanium </strong></p>\n<p>Longtime followers of Alexandera will notice this bike is a bit different than her usual rides in that it has gears! This <a href=\"https://www.chumbausa.com/terlingua-titanium-700c650b-plus\" target=\"_blank\">Terlingua Titanium</a> is a bike that she’ll be using primarily to train on and to mix it up a bit from her usual singlespeed MTB rides. It features a 12 speed Eagle flat bar drivetrain, loaded with <a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth</a> and <a href=\"https://industrynine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Industry Nine</a>. The frame’s finish is Cerakote and the titanium chassis is rolling on 650b+ wheels and WTB tires.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Alexandera-Houchin-Sendero-Titanium-Custom-Chumba-02.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Alexandera-Houchin-Sendero-Titanium-Custom-Chumba-03.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Sendero Titanium</strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, her <a href=\"https://www.chumbausa.com/sendero-titanium-custom-mountain-bike-29er\" target=\"_blank\">Sendero Titanium</a>, which will be her ultra-race bike, is singlespeed and can be built with either a rigid ENVE fork or a Fox Factory 34 120mm travel fork. A mix of Shimano, Wolf Tooth, and White Industries makes up the drivetrain, with a 34t chainring and with the rear cog being swapped out depending on the terrain. As you can see, the inner tubing profiles on the front triangle are adorned with cargo bosses for a direct-mount, bolt-on framebag.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Alexandera-Houchin-Sendero-Titanium-Custom-Chumba-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>While the Titanium Sendero is a production model, Alexandera’s bike is a completely custom geometry, designed by her and Chumba to fit her preferred style of racing ultra-endurance events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Alexandera-Houchin-Sendero-Titanium-Custom-Chumba-01-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The centerpiece of this bike is the head badge, which was designed by Sarah Agaton Howes, from <a href=\"https://www.heartberry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Heart Berry</a>.
