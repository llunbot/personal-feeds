The headset offered users a head-up display and a built-in camera, allowing them to see a small amount of information and capture images of their environment.</p>\n<p>While some tech enthusiasts took to it, it was also widely mocked for its geeky appearance, limited functionality, and potential role in violating the privacy of people around the user. The criticism was so fierce that the term \"Glasshole\" was sometimes used to describe people who wore it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924671#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924671&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d45e5c639792812efce60540f023ccc077ce3e310a25a8e2385d140717045264","category":"Tech"}
