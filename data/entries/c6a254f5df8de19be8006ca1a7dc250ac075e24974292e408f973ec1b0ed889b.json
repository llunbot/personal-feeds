One is the software – ensuring that any bugs and security flaws are addressed. The other is the hardware – providing the parts and labor to fix a problem with your phone (for a price, of course).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s for this reason that we dissuade people from buying particularly old iPhone handsets. The risk that a fault could occur or that you might be exposed to security risks is too high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that Apple does support iPhones for a reasonably long time. Software support lasts more than eight to ten years, while hardware support can be available on five to seven-year-old handsets</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1811287/which-version-of-ios-can-my-iphone-run.html\">which iPhones are supported with the latest operating systems</a>, and which are supported for servicing and repairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a guide to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670438/will-apple-replace-a-broken-iphone-your-rights-explained.html\">how to get a broken iPhone fixed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/apple-products-repair-3802247/#toc-3802247-4\">what Apple product repairs cost and how long they take.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does Apple support iOS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time Apple issues important security updates for iOS. It doesn’t issue an update for every version of iOS though, which means that some iPhones will not get this fix for what could be dangerous vulnerabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of June 2024, Apple supports the following versions of its operating systems for bug and security updates: iOS 17, iOS 16 and iOS 15. When <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> launches in September 2024, it is likely that Apple will drop support for iOS 15 and with it support for the iOS iPhones 7, 6S, 6S Plus and 1st gen SE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the iPhone 6s, original SE, and iPhone 8 are already considered ‘Vintage’ by Apple and the iPhone 6 Plus is considered ‘Obsolete’–more on that below. (Apple doesn’t need to support iOS 14 and iOS 13 because all iPhones that ran those OSs can run iOS 15). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2023, Apple issued a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1483041/ios-12-5-7-iphone-6-security-update-zero-day.html\">security update for iOS 12</a>, which addressed serious security flaws in the iPhones 6 and 5s as well as some iPads that can’t run iPadOS. However, that was the last update to iOS 12, so if you are still using an iPhone 5s or iPhone 6 an upgrade is long overdue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statista (a provider of market and consumer data) publishes a chart that shows how long Apple supports older iPhones. The company updated this chart in June 2023, adding iOS 17. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The graph shows for how long the software on iPhones has been supported by Apple, and the good news is that security support for the operating systems has continued for years after these phones were sold, especially among the newer iPhones.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=615\" alt=\"Which versions of iOS support which iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1197w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=154%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 154w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=768%2C1498&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=615%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 615w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=788%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 788w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=1050%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1050w\" width=\"615\" height=\"1199\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>Statista’s graph shows every iPhone and every iOS.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Which versions of iOS support which iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1197w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=154%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 154w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=768%2C1498&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=615%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 615w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=788%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 788w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=1050%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1050w\" width=\"615\" height=\"1199\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Statista’s graph shows every iPhone and every iOS.</figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/&amp;xcust=1-1-675021-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Which versions of iOS support which iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1197w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=154%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 154w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=768%2C1498&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=615%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 615w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=788%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 788w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/statista.jpeg?resize=1050%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1050w\" width=\"615\" height=\"1199\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Statista’s graph shows every iPhone and every iOS.</figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/&amp;xcust=1-1-675021-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/&amp;xcust=1-1-675021-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The first <strong>iPhone</strong>, which launched in 2007, was able to run iPhone OS 3, which was supported by Apple up until 2010. The iPhone is considered obsolete by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>iPhone 3G</strong>, which launched in 2008, was able to run iOS 4.0, which was itself supported until 2011. The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS are considered obsolete by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The length of support increased with the launch of the <strong>iPhone 4s</strong> in 2011. That phone was able to run operating systems all the way up to iOS 9. Apple was still supporting iOS 9 in 2019 when it issued a GPS-related update that July. The iPhones 4 and 4s are considered obsolete by Apple.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>iPhone 5c</strong> runs iOS 10, which also received the GPS-related update in July 2019. The iPhones 5 and 5c are considered obsolete by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>iPhone 5s</strong> and <strong>iPhone 6</strong> both run iOS 12, for which Apple issued a security update in January 2023. This update was issued for those few devices that don’t support iOS 15. Apple is unlikely to continue support for iOS 12. These phones are considered vintage by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 15, which arrived in September 2021, supports all iPhones from <strong>iPhone 6s</strong> onwards, just as with iOS 14 and iOS 13. Both iOS 14 and 13 are considered obsolete by Apple because the same phones can run iOS 15. The iPhone 6s is already considered vintage by Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-features-compatibility-how-to-update.html\">iOS 16</a>, which arrived in September 2022 runs on all iPhones from the <strong>iPhone 8</strong> onwards – but do note that not all features are available on the older handsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> arrived in September 2023 and runs on all iPhones from the <strong>iPhone XS</strong> onwards – meaning the iPhone X and iPhone 8 will be stuck with iOS 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> is coming in September 2024 and, like iOS 17, will run on all iPhones from the <strong>iPhone XS</strong> onwards. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the oldest iPhone still supported?  </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Apple isn’t continuing support for iOS 12, there is no software support for the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those phones are already considered ‘Vintage’ by Apple (see below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We advise that if you have an iPhone 6 or older and are concerned about security it is time to update your iPhone. This is because Apple is unlikely to issue any more security updates for that phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple continues to support iOS 15 (for now), so the oldest iPhone to be supported is the iPhone 6S, however, this model is also already in Apple’s vintage list, so we would still recommend updating to a newer iPhone. It’s a similar story with the original iPhone SE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple introduces iOS 18 later in 2024 we expect that support for iOS 15 will end, and with it support for anything older than the iPhone 8 (which launched in September 2017). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a list of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1659017/ios-versions-list.html\">every version of iOS</a> where you can see the latest versions of iOS and how long Apple supports iOS for.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.pcwelt.de/1971997_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPhone 5S: Der Nachfolger iPhone 6 soll im September 2014 auf den Markt kommen\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>The iPhone 5S.
