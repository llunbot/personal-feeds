Propped up and flanked by a dedicated team, he’s put exemplary customer service and an egalitarian approach at its centre…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The snowball effect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I got into road cycling about seven or eight years ago to fill a gap after I stopped playing rugby, then slowly fell into helping out at the shop. When I took over the family business entirely five years ago, it was mainly a traditional cycle shop for commuters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I saw the potential to go in a more premium direction and differentiate ourselves from other bike shops, who were struggling at the time. In the past five years we’ve done more and more business each year – it’s just snowballed.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Representation is everything</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When I first got into cycling, I was riding on my own but then started dragging friends out to ride with me. I wanted to help get people into the sport. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot of people from those initial rides had just bought their first bike and that’s now the premise of our customer base – people who started the journey with us. We cater for all abilities, from beginner upwards. We push our women-only beginner rides more than anything, because there’s more of a barrier to getting started if you’re a woman. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2-646x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2-1023x1536.jpg 1023w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2-750x1126.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2-1140x1711.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/pinarello-velo-bavarian-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘There is less representation, less opportunity… it’s a bit more intimidating. Your traditional cyclist is a white, middle-aged man, but we want to inspire everyone. Yes, it is an expensive sport, but if you’re interested and it’s within your budget and your means, we will help anybody get into it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Perfection on the doorstep</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We are on the doorstep of the Peak District, so within half an hour you can be in Darley Dale or Ashbourne, and Bakewell in less than an hour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Equally, we take some of our group rides out towards Derby and further south towards Leicestershire with its back lanes, so you can get the best of both worlds. Generally, going south is flat and going north is hilly – it gets lumpy up towards Matlock. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘One of the favourite routes for newer riders is out towards Uttoxeter – there’s a good cafe and it’s fairly quiet in South Derbyshire. I think I love going out as a group because I grew up in a team sport environment. I enjoy the camaraderie that comes with that shared adventure.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making the dream work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We have a great team. There’s four of us: Jimmy is the mechanic, Matt’s our shop manager, and our sales assistant does a bit of everything. As a small team, we share almost every task. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It doesn’t matter what you sell or how affordable your prices are, it’s all about the people in the business. Our team cares about our customers. They’re the ones spending thousands on a bike, and our priority is to make sure they buy what’s right for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I want people to think six months down the line, “Yeah, those guys sold me the right bike”.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Many sizes fit all</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Because of the 11 frame size options, it’s so easy to get someone a Pinarello that fits. Plus, history and race heritage aside, Pinarello bikes look like pieces of art. That’s why a lot of our wealthier customers opt for a Dogma over any other brand’s top-end bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve sold a lot of Dogma Fs – they’re just so desirable – but then we offer the full range of Dogma X models too, so there’s something for most budgets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But everybody gets the same attention here, regardless of whether they’re buying a £13,000 bike or £3,000 bike.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://velobavarian.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to find out more about Velo Bavarian in Milford, Derbyshire</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-velo-bavarian\">Pinarello focus: Velo Bavarian, Milford, Derbyshire</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5aa085e3bd65dd272d8e22f958dc934376b0a06fd32ccfe2b0fdba5fa5a6cff1","category":"Cycling"}
