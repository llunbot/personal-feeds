But someone claims to be catching and compiling that data and is offering packages that can track more than 600 million users across more than 14,000 servers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/a-spy-site-is-scraping-discord-and-selling-users-messages/\">Joseph Cox at 404 Media confirmed</a> that Spy Pet, a service that sells access to a database of purportedly 3 billion Discord messages, offers data \"credits\" to customers who pay in bitcoin, ethereum, or other cryptocurrency. Searching individual users will reveal the servers that Spy Pet can track them across, a raw and exportable table of their messages, and connected accounts, such as GitHub. Ominously, Spy Pet lists more than 86,000 other servers in which it has \"no bots,\" but \"we know it exists.\"</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spypet_1-980x1289.png\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            An example of Spy Pet's service from its website.

But many Discord users many not expect their messages, server memberships, bans, or other data to be grabbed by a bot, compiled, and sold to anybody wishing to pin them all on a particular user. 404 Media confirmed the service's function with multiple user examples. Private messages are not mentioned by Spy Pet and are presumably still secure.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017957#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017957&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"619a8aff027eb9f115422c05b2845a4ec7ff115c94aa2fa3a110dee35917d028","category":"Tech"}
