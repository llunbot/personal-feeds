A team that is pretty much road-only as far as I know (quite similar to Ineos a few years ago, in fact). And then promptly, Scott Sports sent out a press release saying they were excited to see the 25-year-old Englishman racing on their bikes next year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that Friday PR burst had some curiously vague statements…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q36.5 referred to Pidcock as “Double Olympic Champion” as their highlight, but they only mentioned a couple of road Classics. And they failed to utter any of the words: cyclocross, cross-country, or mountain bike… even though that is where Pidcock won his 2 World Championships and 2 Olympic Gold medals over the past few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-scaled.webp\" alt=\"2024 Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_Ultimate-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Scott’s co-CEO Pascal Ducrot was only a bit clearer, stating that they were “<em>delighted that Tom Pidcock will be joining the team, and will be riding SCOTT road bikes and Syncros components from 2025</em>.” Elaborating just a bit more detail, Scott reiterated that the Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team will ride their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-scott-foil-rc-gets-significantly-faster-lighter-stealthier/\" target=\"_blank\">Foil RC</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-scott-plasma-rc-tt-time-trial-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Plasma RC TT</a> &amp; all-new ultralight <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-addict-rc-is-scotts-lightest-road-bike-ever-from-under-5-9kg/\" target=\"_blank\">Addict RC</a> road bikes in competition in 2025. No mention of anything off-road since that’s out of the team’s racing scope up to now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Q36.5 hasn’t shown any off-road ambitions, so Scott have not really had any reason to expand on that list. But Pidcock is clearly a different story, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pidcock will actually race Scott <em>AND</em> Pinarello bikes in 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype SR Suntour TACT e-suspension, unreleased automatic electronically controlled XC MTB suspension, Tom Pidcock INEOS racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prototype-SR-Suntour-TACT-e-suspension_unreleased-automatic-electronically-controlled-XC-MTB-suspension_Tom-Pidcock-INEOS-XCC-racing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, today Pinarello has cleared up the matter a bit more, announcing that the “<em>multiple world and Olympic champion [will] continue riding Pinarello’s flagship off-road bikes for the next three years.</em>” The keywords there being ‘<em>off-road</em>‘ bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although team and sponsor negotiations must have been a bit more complicated than usual, it makes sense that Q36.5 &amp; Scott were willing to make some concessions to lock in their new star rider, as they look to boost their young team and move up in the ranks of the peloton. Pidcock has shown promise on the road after all, with a 2022 Tour stage win up Alpe d’Huez, Amstel Gold &amp; Strade Bianche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back off-road though, Pidcock did after all work closely with Pinarello to develop 2 completely new off-road bikes for the Italian bike maker while racing for Ineos. In fact, when he started with Ineos, he was racing on BMC bikes with blacked-out logos to keep those sponsors happy. But it looks like things might be a bit more transparent next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tom-Pidcock-Pinarello-Crossista-F-photo-Jordan-Villella-Bikerumor-13.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tom-Pidcock-Pinarello-Crossista-F-photo-Jordan-Villella-Bikerumor-13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tom-Pidcock-Pinarello-Crossista-F-photo-Jordan-Villella-Bikerumor-13.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tom-Pidcock-Pinarello-Crossista-F-photo-Jordan-Villella-Bikerumor-13-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tom-Pidcock-Pinarello-Crossista-F-photo-Jordan-Villella-Bikerumor-13-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tom-Pidcock-Pinarello-Crossista-F-photo-Jordan-Villella-Bikerumor-13-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tom-Pidcock-Pinarello-Crossista-F-photo-Jordan-Villella-Bikerumor-13-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First, Pinarello created an all-new<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/up-close-with-tom-pidcocks-new-pinarello-crossista-f-cyclocross-bike-for-the-world-championships/\" target=\"_blank\"> Crossista F cyclocross bike</a> just for Pidcock.

And again, Pidcock immediately rode his new cross-country bike to another World Championship title, then followed it up with an Olympic Gold medal the next summer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wasn’t specifically involved in their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pinarello-grevil-f-gravel-race-bike/\">Grevil F</a>, as far as I remember. But Pinarello notes that if Pidcock races gravel in the new 3 years, that will be his weapon of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fausto Pinarello told me in person last spring when I was test riding <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-pinarello-dogma-xc-drops-2-carbon-specs-for-full-suspension-hard-tail-mtbs/\" target=\"_blank\">the new Dogma XC</a>, that his team put a lot of time and work into developing new off-road bikes together with Tom Pidcock. So, it’s interesting to hear that this off-road bike development partnership will apparently continue, even after Pidcock joins a team sponsored by another road bike maker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I’ll be paying special attention to how the new team and these two competing bike makers work it all out over the next few race seasons across road, gravel, cyclocross, and mountain bike racing. It’s certainly uncommon to see a professional athlete racing 2 different bike brands in different disciplines, when their team bike sponsor already makes absolutely top-tier race bikes across all categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I guess Tom Pidcock is an unconventional cyclist, so maybe I should be so surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.q36-5procycling.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Q36-5ProCycling.com</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Scott-Sports.com</em></a>, <em>AND</em> <a href=\"https://pinarello.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pinarello.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Full PR texts below…</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>Double Olympic Champion Tom Pidcock Joins Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team</em></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team is proud to welcome Tom Pidcock, as he embarks on an exciting new chapter in his career.
