Written by Dave Filoni, the series stars Rosario Dawson in the title role.</p>\n<p>The Jedi Padawan of Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano\">first introduced</a> as a supporting character in 2008's animated film <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em> and the subsequent animated series. The character returned in the sequel series <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels\">Star Wars Rebels</a></i> (2014-2018) as a member of the Rebel Alliance, operating under the codename Fulcrum, and made numerous other cameo appearances in the extended Star Wars universe. Dawson's live-action version made her debut in <em>The Mandalorian</em>'s second season. We last saw Ahsoka briefly in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/review-the-book-of-boba-fett-is-lots-of-fun-but-its-really-the-mandalorian-2-5/\">The Book of Boba Fett</a>, </em>when she passed on a gift of chain mail to Grogu after warning Mando/Din Djarin that his presence would be a distraction from Grogu's Jedi training. We all know how that turned out: Din and Grogu reunited and went on to share even more adventures in <em>The Mandalorian</em> S3, which will wrap later this month.</p>\n<p>The official premise for <em>Ahsoka</em> is short and sweet: \"Set after the fall of the Empire, <em>Ahsoka</em> follows the former Jedi knight Ahsoka Tano as she investigates an emerging threat to a vulnerable galaxy.\" In addition to Dawson, the cast includes Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Sabine Wren, a young Mandalorian warrior, graffiti artist, and former bounty hunter; Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Hera Syndulla, a former pilot for the Rebellion; Eman Esfandi as Ezra Bridger, a former con artist and thief who trained as a Jedi; and Ray Stevenson as Baylan.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929871#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929871&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04ad5f52416bbd8e81cf8e4b88496f445c6c2daf338447fc5999544d189d8a68","category":"Tech"}
