Navigation is done through horizontal scrolling, which feels more natural on iOS devices than on the desktop.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-online-store-redesign-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nClicking into a product category like Mac presents all of the different options, along with access to comparisons and shopping specialists, accessories, and other information. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-store-redesign-mac-section.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nChoosing to \"Buy\" a product through the store interface goes to the standard purchase pages that can also be accessed through any of the standard Mac, ‌iPad‌, ‌iPhone‌, or Watch categories.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple online store previously had a store tab, but it was removed in an earlier redesign. The return of the tab will make it easier for customers to get to the product they want to purchase without having to navigate through the various product pages for each device to find the \"Buy\" button.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-website-redesigned-store/\">Apple's Website Gains Redesigned Store Section and Dedicated 'Store' Tab</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-website-gains-redesigned-store-section-and-dedicated-store-tab.2306433/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vuxhTrX3jWo:udI58rOdzR8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vuxhTrX3jWo:udI58rOdzR8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vuxhTrX3jWo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a16cbce27389c94dcdd0e4afce81e7564ab321bfcb907200f8764efdfbea2014","category":"Apple"}
