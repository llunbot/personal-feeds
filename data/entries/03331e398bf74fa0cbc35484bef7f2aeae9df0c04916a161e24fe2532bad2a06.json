{"title":"Background Information on Hemisphere/DAS","link":"https://www.eff.org/cases/hemisphere","date":1700606413000,"content":"\n<p>More information on the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/21/das-secret-phone-record-program\">aforelinked secret program</a> that provides U.S. law enforcement with <em>trillions</em> of phone call records, including location data, from the EFF:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Hemisphere” came to light amidst the public uproar over \nrevelations that the NSA had been collecting phone records on \nmillions of innocent people. However, Hemisphere wasn’t a program \nrevealed by Edward Snowden’s leaks, but rather its exposure was \npure serendipity: a citizen activist in Seattle discovered the \nprogram when shocking presentations outlining the program were \nprovided to him in response to regular old public records \nrequests. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/hemisphere-muckrock-slides-ondcp\">This slide deck hosted by the EFF</a> is one of those presentations, and worth your attention. The system’s capabilities are terrifying. From page 9 of that deck, highlighting Hemisphere’s “Special Features”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li><p>Dropped Phones — Hemisphere uses special software that analyzes \nthe calling pattern of a previous target phone to find the new \nnumber. <em>Hemisphere has been averaging above a 90% success rate \nwhen searching for dropped phones.</em> </p></li>\n<li><p>Additional Phones — Hemisphere utilizes a similar process to \ndetermine additional cell phones the target is using that are \nunknown to law enforcement. </p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if a target throws away their phone, switches to a new burner phone, but continues calling the same people, Hemisphere claims a 90 percent success rate identifying that new phone.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li>Advanced Results — Hemisphere is able to provide two levels of \ncall detail records for one target number by examining the \ndirect contacts for the original target, and identifying \npossibly significant numbers that might return useful CDRs. </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the system analyzes not just the phone records of the target, but the records of every single number the target calls.</p>\n\n<p>Page 20 of the deck is highly redacted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li><p>Hemisphere can capture data regarding local calls, long distance \ncalls, international calls, cellular calls [???] </p></li>\n<li><p>Hemisphere does NOT capture █████████████████████████ subscriber \ninformation [???] </p></li>\n<li><p>Highlights of any basic request include: \n█████████████████████████ █████████████████████████████████ \ntemporary roaming and location data, and traffic associated with \ninternational numbers </p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m using “[???]” to denote spots where I suspect information has been redacted, and “█” to indicate obvious redactions. I sure would love to know what’s redacted there. Again, my mind runs to text messages.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/21/background-on-hemisphere\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"03331e398bf74fa0cbc35484bef7f2aeae9df0c04916a161e24fe2532bad2a06","category":"Tech"}
