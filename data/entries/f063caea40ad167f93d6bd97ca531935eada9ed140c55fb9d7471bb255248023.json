As a rule, it can't do both at once, but General Motors has some thoughts about that. The patent analysis site <a href=\"https://carmoses.com/gm-wants-evs-to-charge-and-supply-power-at-the-same-time/\">CarMoses</a> spotted a recent GM <a href=\"https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/20240424943?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI0ZTM5ZjBhZi02ODMxLTQ0YTEtYWU2MS0xNzY2MDIzZTEwMDUiLCJ2ZXIiOiI1NjRhNWFiOC0zNWQwLTQ3OTgtYjEyMy00ZWUzODE3OGQwNzIiLCJleHAiOjB9\">patent application</a> for a system that is capable of charging and discharging simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The patent describes a \"charging system\" with a pair of charging ports. One is for drawing power from an external source, just like every other EV. The second charge port is connected to a bi-directional charger, and the battery management system is able to charge the battery pack from the first port while also supplying power from the second port.</p>\n<p>That second port could be used to charge another battery, including the battery of another EV, and the patent includes an illustration of three EVs daisy-chained to each other.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/gm-patents-ev-that-can-charge-and-power-stuff-simultaneously/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/gm-patents-ev-that-can-charge-and-power-stuff-simultaneously/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
