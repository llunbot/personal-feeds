And if your choice is red, will you be risking a headache? The fact that red wine can sometimes cause headaches in certain individuals (especially those prone to migraines) is common knowledgeâ€”so much so that the phenomenon (\"RWH\") even has its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wine_headache\">own Wikipedia page</a>. The Roman encyclopedist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus\">Celsus</a> wrote in his treatise <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Medicina\">De Medicina</a></em> about the pain felt after drinking wine, while six centuries later, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_of_Aegina\">Paul of Aegina</a> mentioned that drinking wine could trigger a headache.</p>\n<p>But the science to date is largely unclear regarding which components of red wine are responsible, as well as the mechanisms behind the phenomenon. A team of California scientists has narrowed down the likely culprits to a flavonol called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin\">quercetin</a>, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-46203-y#:~:text=Consumption%20of%20red%20wine%20has,of%20headaches%20in%20susceptible%20subjects.\">new paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports, although they have yet to run experiments with participants prone to RWH to test their hypothesis.</p>\n<p>It's a knotty issue because of the complexities of both wine and human genetics/physiology. Wine is basically water and alcohol, along with acids, dissolved sugars, and other compounds that lend color and flavor. For instance, the tannins in wine are polyphenolic compounds responsible for much of the bitterness and astringency in a given wine; they're derived from the skins and stems of the grapes, or as a result of aging in oak barrels.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984917#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984917&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b630fab481a6139f6c5e54038642e48454479b9f6f5f875e79c01f1e4a52cfd","category":"Tech"}
