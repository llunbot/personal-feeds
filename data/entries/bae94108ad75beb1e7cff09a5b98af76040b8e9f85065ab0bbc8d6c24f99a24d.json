Archaeologists successfully raised the ship in 1982, along with thousands of articles and the remains of 179 crew membersâ€”all remarkably well preserved thanks to the anaerobic conditions of the shipwreck created by the layers of soft sediment that accumulated over the wreckage.</p>\n<p>A new analysis of some of the recovered bones reveals that whether someone is right- or left-handed could affect how their collarbone chemistry changes as they age, according to a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311717\">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE. This has implications for our understanding not just of aging, but of bone conditions like fracture risk and osteoarthritis.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/x-rayed-artifacts-from-famed-shipwreck-shed-light-on-secrets-of-tudor-armor\">previously reported</a>, the earliest-known reference to the <em>Mary Rose</em> appears in a January 29, 1510, letter ordering the construction of two new ships for the young king: the <em>Mary Rose</em> and her sister ship, dubbed the <em>Peter Pomegranate</em>. Once the newly built ship had launched, Henry VIII wasted no time defying his advisers and declaring war on France in 1512. The <em>Mary Rose</em> served the monarch well through that conflict, as well as during a second war with the French that ran roughly from 1522 through 1525, after which it underwent a substantial overhaul.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/scientists-glean-clues-about-how-we-age-from-mary-rose-crew-bones/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/scientists-glean-clues-about-how-we-age-from-mary-rose-crew-bones/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bae94108ad75beb1e7cff09a5b98af76040b8e9f85065ab0bbc8d6c24f99a24d","category":"Tech"}
