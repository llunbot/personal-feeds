But I still wasn't prepared for how disarmingly compelling it would be to listen to <a href=\"https://notebooklm.google/\">Google's NotebookLM</a> condense <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/\">my recent book about <em>Minesweeper</em></a> into a tight, 12.5-minute, podcast-style conversation between two people who don't exist.</p>\n<p>There are still enough notable issues with NotebookLM's audio output to prevent it from fully replacing professional podcasters any time soon. Even so, the podcast-like format is an incredibly engaging and endearing way to take in complex information and points to a much more personable future for generative AI than the dry back-and-forth of a text-based chatbot.</p>\n<h2>Hey! Listen!</h2>\n\n<p><em>Listen to NotebookLM's 12.5-minute summary of my <em>Minesweeper</em> book using the player above.</em></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051549#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051549&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2a41274d68b0c640339a686b91834320df9d2d1908b05584757b0d5609ffe31","category":"Tech"}
