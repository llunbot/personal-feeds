The tweet includes a gif showing an Apple logo that morphs into a heart and back into the Apple logo. Anyone who likes the tweet will receive a reminder tweet on the morning of June 5 to watch the keynote at 10 am PT.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>A new era begins.

While Apple is expected to launch numerous products at the event, “a new era” certainly speaks to something bigger than a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> or some <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">new iOS 17 features</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to years of rumors, the headset is part of a years-long plan to bring AR and VR mainstream and ultimately supplant the iPhone with a pair of high-tech glasses. The device debuting next week will certainly be significantly larger than that, with a rumored design that resembles a pair of ski goggles and an extremely high price tag, likely topping $3,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Apple is playing a long game with the headset and isn’t expecting sales out of the gate. Rather, it wants to use this high-end headset to pique curiosities and anticipation for a more affordable model coming in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s WWDC keynote is on June 5 at 10 a.m. PT.
