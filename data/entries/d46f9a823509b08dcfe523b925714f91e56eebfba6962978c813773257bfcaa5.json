It was a palmtop. It was a PDA. It was Windows Phone 7 but not Windows Phone 8, and then it was an embedded ghost. Its parents never seemed to know what to do with it after it grew up, beyond offer it up for anybody to shape in their own image. And then, earlier this month, with little notice, Windows CE was no more, at least as a supported operating system. Windows Embedded Compact 2013, or sometimes Windows CE 8.0, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/end-of-support/end-of-support-2023\">reached end of support on October 10, 2023</a>, as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/30/windows_ce_reaches_eol/\">noted by The Register</a>.</p>\n<p>Windows CE, which <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211214-00/?p=106030\">had a name that didn't stand for anything</a> and was sometimes rendered as \"wince,\" is not survived by anything, really.
