DuckDuckGo is currently turning up\nseven links when searching Reddit, but provides no data on where\nthe links go or why, instead only saying that “We would like to\nshow you a description here but the site won’t allow us.” Older\nresults will still show up, but these search engines are no longer\nable to “crawl” Reddit, meaning that Google is the only search\nengine that will turn up results from Reddit going forward.\nSearching for Reddit still works on Kagi, an independent, paid\nsearch engine that buys part of its search index from Google.</p>\n\n<p>The news shows how Google’s near monopoly on search is now\nactively hindering other companies’ ability to compete at a time\nwhen Google is facing increasing criticism over the quality of its\nsearch results. This exclusion of other search engines also comes\nafter Reddit locked down access to its site to stop companies from\nscraping it for AI training data, which at the moment only Google\ncan do as a result of a multi-million dollar deal that gives\nGoogle the right to scrape Reddit for data to train its AI\nproducts.</p>\n\n<p>“They’re [Reddit] killing everything for search but Google,”\nColin Hayhurst, CEO of the search engine Mojeek told me on a call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have to blame Reddit for this, not Google. But it’s not a good look for Google, either.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/26/google-reddit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"04634ce50aefac9f6807d63185505952b6244e62857ac138d066bed7ac695e6b","category":"Tech"}
