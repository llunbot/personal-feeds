In September, Meta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/whatsapp-beta-native-ipad-support/\">started beta testing</a> WhatsApp for ‌iPad‌ via TestFlight.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhatsApp allows users of the encrypted messaging platform to link up to four devices to their account even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet. Each linked device connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring that personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to WhatsApp, Meta owns Facebook, Threads, and Instagram. There is an ‌iPad‌ app for Facebook, but the Threads app remains <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> only.
