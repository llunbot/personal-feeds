I am an environmental engineer working as a technical expert at TÜV SÜD in Germany. In our bike-community I am better known as Rapapongi, the guy building very 😉 non-conformist bikes for myself and family.</p>\n<p>Growing up on a farm and riding bikes was just the way to go. No fancy café-racing or multi-day bikepacking adventures … just purpose.</p>\n<p>It all started with Covid, where parts have been scarce, and shops being closed … with a bended derailleur hanger and an alignment gauge.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For me creating a new built is a very intimate process. It is not only a purpose what drives me but also intense work of creating art. In school I was influenced by the “Readymade” artists but also by industrial designers and architects. In addition to that craftsmanship, innovation and quality drive my heart … so building bikes merges all that interests.</p>\n<p>Coming to my absolute favorite bike, yet. The stridsland beachcomber with 3×3 gearhub. What this bike doing so good, is that it merges history, art and functionality in one great package. It takes all the references and merits from the old times and put it on a very modern technical level.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_015.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_015.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_015.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_015.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_018.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_018.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_018.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_018.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Steel frame and gear hub. Thru axle and disc brake. 26+ and 650B. Fancy Purple and neon yellow … A bike letting me smile on every ride.</p>\n<p>Even at first sight, I knew the Beachcomber frame was really something special. The design practically screams “adventure” and “freedom”. Anachronistically based on old-school MTBs from the 90s and designed for 26+, it looks like it came straight out of a surf shop in California… er, sorry Matias… Denmark of course 😁…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_019.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_019.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_019.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_019.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_07.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_07.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Getting on the Beachcomber is an experience. Thanks to the extra-wide tires and the BB height, you feel like you’re on a monster truck that can suddenly jump like a rabbit. Matias Stridsland says MTBMX… I think that’s on point.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_09.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_09.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_01.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_01.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>You roll over curbs and gravel as if they are non-existent. Fat tires have such strong cushioning that it feels like you’re riding on clouds and do have endless grip going uphill. At the same time, the wheels turn super easily. An absolute toy despite the weight. Stridsland has mixed the best of many worlds together and made something better out of it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_021.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_021.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_021.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_021.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_012.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_012.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_012.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_012.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_06.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_06.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Technology: 3X3 gear hub free of maintenance.</p>\n<p>The concept works even better with the robust gear hub than I could have imagined.

Recently, a young guy pointing to the hub asked what kind of e-bike it is… and I replied: The motor is my legs and I have Styrian-power in the tank and what about you? :-D</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_022.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_022.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_022.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Stridsland_Beachcomber_3x3_022.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A special highlight is the “party mode”… including a color-matching front rack from Allygn. Ideal for bringing good beer and snacks to the beach. Honestly, a bike in the house with a front rack is a must!
