It even has an optional accessory ladder for a secondary entry and exit point. This means you can exit and enter the tent without disturbing your fellow campers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent shoe bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-shoe-bags-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Condor 2 XXL Air is a fold-out type roof-top tent and is Roofnest’s latest flagship tent. And, some of its features and accessories will expand and be incorporated across the Roofnest line in the coming years. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent 51 sqft\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-51-sqft-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Condor 2 XXL Air is fully open, it measures 102″ long, 80″ wide, and four feet of maximum headroom. The mattress itself is 8′ long x 6.5″ wide, that’s 51 square feet of mattress space. Roofnest says that it will let 4 adults sleep with each camper having 24″ of shoulder room. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the large interior volume of the tent, when closed, the Condor 2 XXL Air is pretty compact, measuring 88″ long, 60″ wide, and 15″ tall. Roofnest says that this is the same closed size as the Falcon 3EVO XL, which is the brand’s largest clamshell rooftop tent. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Condor 2 XXL Air is <em>All</em> New </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Condor 2 XXL Air is all new and is not an extended version of the Condor 2 XL Air. The Condor XXL 2 Air debuts with a new shell and tent structural design that maximizes the interior space and ease of use while keeping the weight low. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent enterance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-enterance-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent inside poles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-inside-poles-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new tent also has modular side windows that can be used with a simple rainfly conopy covering. Making for a fast setup and breakdown, this makes it ideal for bed-height truck mounting options. There is also an additional supported flap that can be deployed for full coverage in any weather condition. The Condor 2 XXL Air has no additional components to manipulate or extend. This makes it the fastest-deploying Roofnest yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent awning opening\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-awning-opening-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The Condor 2 XXL Air is not only the biggest hardshell on the market, it’s also the easiest to operate thanks to the additional U-bar and redesigned four-way windows</em>,” said Roofnest CEO Dave Rogers. “<em>What’s more, Condor 2 XXL Air sets up in half the time of the competition. Condor 2 XXL Air is the new pinnacle of the hardshell rooftop tent industry and perfect for families who want to camp in comfort.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What About the Shell?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The compounded PC-ABS hardshell design is a key component of the Condor 2 XXL Air. It can provide all-weather protection and stability when closed, but especially helps when open. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top-.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top-.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top-.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-top--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shell’s material is compounded, not laminated, with UV stabilizers mixed into the material. This ensures it won’t fade after extended exposure to the sun’s UV, and it won’t bubble or peel. At the factory, the tent is finished with a LINE-X coating. LINE-X is a popular ruggedized truck-bed liner; this adds another bit of protection and gives it a handsome matte finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent open with camper\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-open-with-camper-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The best way to describe the toughness of the Condor 2 XXL Air’s shell is to take a car bumper, make it twice as thick, then cover it with LINE-X</em>,” said Turner Sessions, Roofnest’s Director of Engineering. “<em>Top-shell fatigue is also limited by the interior frame, which limits the stress on the shell but also offers customers the ability to install accessory cross bars on the Condor 2 XXL Air, which can hold up to 150 pounds of gear when the tent is closed.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Condor 2 XXL Air uses an integrated 7.5-foot telescoping ladder and a 2-inch-thick foam core air mattress. Using an inflatable rather than a solid foam mattress makes it easy to dial in the comfort of the mattress to fit the camper’s comfort needs. Plus, you can leave it inflated, cutting time off the tent-closing process. Not to mention the new mattress is lighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent mattress valve\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-mattress-valve-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent sleep system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sleep-system-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent bamboo sheets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-bamboo-sheets-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket.webp\" alt=\"Roofnest Condor 2 XXL Air Roof Top Tent sheets and puffy blanket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Roofnest-Condor-2-XXL-Air-Roof-Top-Tent-sheets-and-puffy-blanket-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new mattress system is part of the Roofnest’s new “Rest EZ Sleep System”.
