For marketers in particular, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://stck.media/r/spectrm-macworld-editorial-blog&amp;xcust=1-1-552429-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">attaining consumer data</a> is top of mind, as this intel is key for everything from lead generation to driving revenue. On the other hand, consumers are savvier than ever and are demanding their privacy (or at least some power over it). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, regulations like the EU’s GDPR (or General Data Protection Regulation) and Google’s decision to eliminate cookies from Chrome (that’s 60% of the browser market share) have introduced new hurdles for companies trying to reach customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, leading marketers are turning to conversational marketing to not only circumvent these obstacles but also create meaningful communications that let consumers share data about themselves. These organizations are employing <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://stck.media/r/spectrm-macworld-editorial-book-demo&amp;xcust=1-1-552429-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Spectrm</a>, the conversational marketing automation platform changing the chatbot game.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conversational marketing makes data more attainable </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spectrm is a platform that brands use to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://stck.media/r/spectrm-macworld-editorial-book-demo&amp;xcust=1-1-552429-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">build engaging, conversational chatbots</a>, which help reduce manual labor while providing a fast and enjoyable consumer experience. These chatbots can do everything from acquiring customers to helping them make a purchase and even upselling them with curated, recommended items. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By enabling conversational marketing via the bots, customers can directly share information; this triggers a pleasant and personalized experience for them and a data feedback loop that is marketing gold. In sum, with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://stck.media/r/spectrm-macworld-editorial-book-demo&amp;xcust=1-1-552429-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">conversational marketing</a>, you’re continuously learning and understanding what consumers want, directly from the source.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The imperative for first-party data </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting first-party data ensures you’re following regulations and respecting the overarching consumer desire for privacy – all while collecting meaningful information that enhances the customer experience and your marketing performance (not to mention your revenue). With the continuing rollout of products that help consumers keep their data safe, the old way of doing things is becoming obsolete. For example, Apple’s iOS 14 – with new privacy features that give users the power to control how apps access their data (location, camera, mic, etc.) – is already running on nearly 75% of all Apple devices. Now’s the time to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://spectrm.io/growth-solutions/conversational-guided-shopping/&amp;xcust=1-1-552429-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">invest in a top-performing conversational marketing solution</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What your social media strategy is missing </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we’ve established the urgency, let’s look at another important feature that Spectrm underscores: reaching your customers where they like to spend their time.
