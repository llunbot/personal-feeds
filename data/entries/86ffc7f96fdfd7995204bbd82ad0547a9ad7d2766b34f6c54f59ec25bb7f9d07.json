This sees a longer wheelbase and frame reach complemented by a shorter stem, which Bianchi says offers “greater stability”.</p>\n<p>Tyre clearance is capped at a comparatively conservative (by modern gravel bike standards) 42mm on 700c rims, however.</p>\n<h2>Bianchi’s racing spirit</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-race-bikes/\">gravel race bike</a>’ category (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/gravel-bike-categorisation/\">gravel bike categorisation</a> is a hot topic right now), alongside bikes such as the <a

Corse’ – meaning it has been developed by Bianchi’s racing division.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

end.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bianchi</i></span></div>\n<p>Seeking to balance aerodynamic efficiency, weight and “off-road capability”, Bianchi says the Impulso RC is designed for “hard-packed dirt to loose gravel, to the occasional mud section or asphalt”.</p>\n<p>Or in other words, the kind of terrain often seen in elite gravel races such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2023-uci-gravel-world-championships-tech-gallery/\">UCI Gravel World Championships</a> and events in the Lifetime Grand Prix series.</p>\n<div>\n

<i>Bianchi</i></span></div>\n<p>Thanks to its aerodynamically-optimised frameset, cockpit and wheelset, Bianchi boldly claims the Impulso RC is “one of the most aerodynamic gravel bikes in its category”.</p>\n<p>At the rear of the bike, the slim seat stays are said to be optimised for both comfort and aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

clearance is officially capped at 42mm on 700c rims, which is relatively conservative by modern standards (many gravel bikes can clear at least a 45mm tyre on 700c rims nowadays).</p>\n<p>The frameset geometry is more progressive, however, with elongated reach figures across the size range, slacker head tube angles and long wheelbases.</p>\n<p>The Impulso RC frameset is compatible with both 2x or 1x drivetrains, as well as mechanical or electronic groupsets.</p>\n<h2>Reparto Corse AeroFlare integrated cockpit</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

Reparto Corse AeroFlare integrated cockpit is designed for gravel racing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bianchi</i></span></div>\n<p>As with an aero road bike, Bianchi has paid close attention to the leading edges of the Impulso RC.</p>\n<p>This naturally includes an aerodynamically-optimised handlebar, and in this instance, Bianchi has designed a new integrated cockpit, with fully internal cable routing (using the Acros ICR system).</p>\n<p>The Reparto Corse AeroFlare integrated cockpit is constructed from carbon fibre and features an aerodynamically optimised stem and top section, along with drops that flare out by 16 degrees.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

tops.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bianchi</i></span></div>\n<p>Available in nine sizes from 90x400mm to 120x440mm, the cockpit has a -7 degree stem angle, with bar widths measured centre-to-centre at the hoods.</p>\n<p>It’s also said to be “extremely light”, with a claimed weight of 340g for a size 110x400mm.</p>\n<h2>Reparto Corse 43 Ceramitech wheelset</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

increased focus on developing its own wheelsets to complement its racing bikes in recent years, and the Impulso RC is no different.</p>\n<p>The Reparto Corse 43 Ceramitech wheelset has, Bianchi says, been designed specifically for the Impulso RC and for the rigours of elite gravel racing.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, the wheelset features a pair of 43mm-deep, tubeless-ready carbon rims, designed to balance aerodynamic performance, low weight and handling stability.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

bearings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bianchi</i></span></div>\n<p>These rims feature a wide, 32mm external rim width alongside a 25mm internal width, optimised for the wider gravel tyres most racers now use.</p>\n<p>The hubs are Bianchi’s own and are said to feature “high-end” ceramic bearings.</p>\n<p>Bianchi claims a total weight of 1,570g (+/- 5 per cent) for the complete wheelset.</p>\n<h2>2024 Bianchi Impulso range</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

frameset along with a racy build, including a SRAM Force AXS wireless electronic groupset, the Reparto Corse 43 Ceramitech wheelset, the Reparto Corse AeroFlare integrated cockpit and Pirelli’s highly-rated Cinturato Gravel RC tyres.</p>\n<p>The Impuslo Pro and Impulso Comp framesets feature cheaper carbon lay-ups, alongside the latest 12-speed mechanical Shimano GRX groupsets, alloy
