Meta typically alters\npolicies that govern its apps — which include Facebook,\nInstagram, WhatsApp and Threads — by inviting employees, civic\nleaders and others to weigh in. Any shifts generally take months.\nBut Mr. Zuckerberg turned this latest effort into a closely held\nsix-week sprint, blindsiding even employees on his policy and\nintegrity teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Months-long processes with a large number of stakeholders from inside and outside the company are the way you make policy changes intended to be as uncontroversial as possible. A six-week sprint with a tight team is how you make policy changes that you know will be controversial. The process was unusual because the nature of the changes was unusual.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In interviews, more than a dozen current and former Meta\nemployees, executives and advisers to Mr. Zuckerberg described his\nshift as serving a dual purpose. It positions Meta for the\npolitical landscape of the moment, with conservative power\nascendant in Washington as Mr. Trump takes office on Jan. 20. More\nthan that, the changes reflect Mr. Zuckerberg’s personal views of\nhow his $1.5 trillion company should be run — and he no longer\nwants to keep those views quiet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This rings true to my ears, and my take on Zuckerberg. But they run counter to the Times’s headline for the story, which paints alignment with Trump as the primary motivation. I think it’s pretty clear that aligning with Trump is just the cover for Zuckerberg putting Meta’s content moderation policies back where he feels they should always have been. Zuck’s not rightwing but he’s not anti-right-wing. But for a large swath of the left today, anyone who’s not anti-right-wing <em>is</em> right-wing. Zuck is done trying to placate those of that mindset.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At Meta, Mr. Zuckerberg began preparing to change speech policies.\nKnowing that any moves would be contentious, he assembled a team\nof no more than a dozen close advisers and lieutenants, including\nJoel Kaplan, a longtime policy executive with strong ties to the\nRepublican Party; Kevin Martin, the head of U.S. policy; and David\nGinsberg, the head of communications. Mr. Zuckerberg insisted on\nno leaks, the people with knowledge of the effort said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And give them credit — not a whisper regarding these changes leaked in advance of Zuckerberg dropping them in his Instagram video. Meta announced these changes on their own terms, in their own way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some employees were livid at what they saw as efforts by\nexecutives to hide changes to the “Hateful Conduct” policy before\nit was announced, two people said. While people across the policy\ndivision typically view and comment on significant revisions, most\ndid not have the opportunity this time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some employees were surprised, after years of working a company run by a face-eating founder who owns a controlling share of the company’s stock and thus answers to no one but himself, to find their own faces eaten off.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/11/zucks-sprint\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6bf4bc7b9222733d6c85e665d1a1f41cb34c198b12ef19a0e382cde6e6f0435d","category":"Tech"}
