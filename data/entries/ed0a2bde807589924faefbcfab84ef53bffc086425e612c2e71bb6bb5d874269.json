Gurman expects the next model to feature a newer chip, but few other changes. Additional features rumored by other sources include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apples-2024-ipad-mini-all-the-rumors-so-far/\">camera upgrades and a fix for the \"jelly scrolling\" display behavior</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe low-end iPad was last updated in October 2022. An eleventh-generation iPad could start at a lower price than the 10th-generation iPad, which could pave the way for Apple to discontinue the ninth-generation iPad with the Lightning connector.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/when-to-expect-next-ipad-mini/\">When to Expect the Next iPad Mini and Low-End iPad Models to Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-the-next-ipad-mini-and-low-end-ipad-models-to-launch.2423710/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ed0a2bde807589924faefbcfab84ef53bffc086425e612c2e71bb6bb5d874269","category":"Apple"}
