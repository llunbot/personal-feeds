(<em>Jiiiii</em> — with five i’s — is the onomatopoeia for staring at something, commonly used in Japanese media.) With over 75 shows that aired this past season alone, keeping up with and discovering new anime can be hard, especially across several streaming services. Jiiiii makes that simple by giving you a <em>single</em> schedule to check as you await your favorite’s show’s next episode.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike any other anime aggregation site, Jiiiii has a collection of beautiful native apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Vision Pro, making it <em>the</em> best way to keep up with anime on Apple devices. They even have a progressive web app in beta, that you can download on almost any other platform to get a similar experience.</p>\n\n<p>The best part? No ads, no tracking, and complete privacy — all the benefits you’d expect from <a href=\"https://jiiiii.moe/contact\">the indie husband-and-wife developers Dimitri and Linh Bouniol</a>. (Dimitri <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@codecompletion\">streamed the entire development of Jiiiii to YouTube</a>, and continues to do so every night.)</p>\n\n<p>Catch up on anything you missed from the fall season, and <a href=\"https://jiiiii.moe/\">get ready for the winter season’s new anime with Jiiiii</a>, and never miss out on a show again.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/22/jiiiii\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"222a981bf8810f22283d4f2bbed7ff2bcc1bd75b4c1380d6eacf3da1051379d3","category":"Tech"}
