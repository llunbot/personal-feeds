{"title":"Metropolis 1998 lets you design every building in an isometric, pixel-art city","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040744","date":1722616987000,"content":"<div>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/metropolis2-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Designing the pieces of a house in Metropolis 1998, with a series of bookshelves and couches open in the menu picker on-screen.\" />\n      <p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/metropolis2.jpg\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> There is something so wonderfully obscene about having a town with hundreds of people living their lives, running into conflict, hoping for better, and your omnipotent self is stuck on which bookcase best fits this living room corner.

How many more <em>Dark Fallen Journeys </em>andÂ <em>Noun: Verb of the Noun</em> games can fit into the market? And yet certain games just appear with a near-perfect, properly descriptive label.</p>\n<p><em>Metropolis 1998</em> is just such a game, telling you what you'll be doing, how it will look and feel, and what era it harkens back to. You can verify this with <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287430/Metropolis_1998/\">its \"pre-alpha\" demo on Steam</a> and <a href=\"https://yesbox.itch.io/archapolis\">Itch.io</a>. There's plenty more to come, but what is already in place is impressive. And it's simply pleasant to play, especially if you're the type who wants to make something entirely yours. Not just \"put the park inside the commercial district,\" but <em>The-Sims-</em>style \"choose which wood color for the dining room table in a living room you framed up yourself.\"</p>\n<p>You start out in a big field with no features (yet) and the sounds of birds chirping. Once you lay down a road, you can add things at a few different levels. You can, <em>SimCity</em>-style, simply plot out colored zones and let the people figure it out themselves. You can add pre-made buildings individually. Or you can really get in there, spacing out individual rooms, choosing the doors and windows and objects inside, and realizing how hard it is to shape multi-floor houses so the roof doesn't look grotesque. You can save the filled-out house for later reuse or just hold on to its core aspects as a blueprint.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040744#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040744&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78a0b13d90213c820a47c62b7610429caa6746cc608373806a91b9b7d2a4fd58","category":"Tech"}
