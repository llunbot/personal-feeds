Bedding in your disc brakes transfers some of the pad’s material onto the rotor to enable them to better mate together.</p>\n<p>It’s best to bed in your disc brakes in a controlled manner rather than just going out for a ride, to avoid transferring too much material and clogging the pores of the disc brake rotor.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll take you through some simple steps on how to bed in your disc brakes. Although we’ve demonstrated the process on a gravel bike, these steps are also applicable to road, hybrid and mountain bikes.</p>\n<h2>1. Make sure both pads and rotors are clean</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cleaning disc brake caliper with Muc Off disc brake cleaner\" title=\"Cleaning disc brake caliper with Muc Off disc brake cleaner\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pads and rotor should be spotless.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes riders make is putting new pads into a system where the rotors are already dirty with oils or other contaminants.</p>\n<p>Whenever you change your pads, make sure you scrupulously clean the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/disc-brake-rotors/\">disc brake rotor</a> with either isopropyl alcohol or a specific disc brake cleaner. Make sure you use a lint-free rag to remove any residue.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano brake pad and disc brake rotor\" title=\"Shimano brake pad and disc brake rotor\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pad and braking surface of the rotor work as a pair.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Also, avoid touching the braking surface of the rotor or the pad material with your fingers because the oils in your skin can contaminate them.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>2. Find a safe place</h2>\n<p>It’s best to bed in new disc brakes in a safe, car-free environment where you can repeatedly speed up and slow down safely. A long, gradual slope would be ideal, but isn’t essential.</p>\n<h2>3. Keep it simple</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pulling both Shimano GRX levers evenly\" title=\"Pulling both Shimano GRX levers evenly\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Apply both brakes evenly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Staying seated on the bike, ride up to a moderate speed and then apply the brake. The goal is to drag the pads on the rotor to evenly deposit material between them.</p>\n<p>Don’t come down to a complete stop. When you reach a walking pace, release the brakes and speed up again.</p>\n<p>When you slow down, avoid locking up the brake. All this will achieve is a heavy transfer of material in one spot.</p>\n<h2>4. Repeat 15-20 times</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oscar Huckle bedding in disc brakes on a Trek Checkpoint ALR\" title=\"Oscar Huckle bedding in disc brakes on a Trek Checkpoint ALR\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Be sure to give yourself plenty of space when bedding in new brakes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Repeat this process 15 to 20 times. You should feel the brakes becoming more powerful through the process.</p>\n<p>Some people like to wet the caliper and rotor in clean, cold water after each stop cycle. The theory is the water creates a slurry between the pad and rotor, akin to a wet stone. We’re split on this and it isn’t something brake manufacturers typically advocate in their literature.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve completed the cycle, SRAM recommends leaving the bike for a while to let the brakes cool and allow the transferred material to set.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"1bade92ce1f7509c7dc08da689de78b2d87e9c562addb083bb9e35fd0542f126","category":"Cycling"}
