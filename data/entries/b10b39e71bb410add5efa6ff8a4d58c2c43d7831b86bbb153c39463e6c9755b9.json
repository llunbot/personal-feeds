{"title":"MOOTS + BLACK MAGIC PAINT","link":"https://moots.com/moots-black-magic-paint/","date":1626366780000,"content":"<p>Moots bikes and paint go way back….waaay back to the era of 1981-1991 when we built out of steel and paint was needed to keep the frames from rusting away.  It also gave the Moots creative types<span></span> the ability to run wild with design on one-off paint schemes that graced the bikes of that time. Well, as Moots evolved and turned to titanium, the need for paint was shelved. At that time the paint booth (a small closet) was mothballed and Moots moved on to blasted finishes as our mainstay.<span>  </span>Our finish evolution continued with etched, brushed, and all sorts of anodized colors and patterns.</p>\n<p>While we still don’t offer in-house paint, we are expanding our Finish Options and will be using BLACK MAGIC PAINT in Portland as our paint partner going forward. Black Magic Paint is a trusted source of bicycle paint applications and have won numerous awards in the industry. They are a team of 4, have been turning out the most beautiful paint layouts for years, and offer a customer experience equal to Moots. <span>   </span></p>\n<p><span> <img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/51026590766_64cbe9f148_k.jpg\" /></span></p>\n<p>3/4 paint that allows Moots handy work to be seen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1-blank-frame.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>“Prep-for-paint” Moots frame freshly blasted, small bits bagged and ready to go off to Black Magic Paint.</p>\n<p>HOW DO YOU GET YOUR MOOTS PAINTED?</p>\n<p>We call it PREP-FOR-PAINT.
