Apple case. It seems pretty clear to me that Apple got a huge victory, and Epic was served an even huger loss.  But read for yourself. There are three documents:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/814/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/\">A one-page judgment</a>, finding for Epic only on the issue of Apple’s anti-steering provision in the App Store Guidelines, and for Apple on all other counts. The judgment also says Epic owes Apple 30 percent of the $12 million Fortnite for iOS garnered while they were using their own in-app payment processing between August and October 2020, and that Epic and Apple must both pay their own legal fees.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/813/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/\">A one-page injunction</a> against the aforementioned anti-steering guideline, the meat of which is this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol><li>Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.</li></ol>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/812/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/\">A 185-page ruling</a>, containing all the findings of fact, etc.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/10/judgment-in-epic-v-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ecd7d51eeee4ea877975107bdb7ef3de3706a5c5029fa9a05fa331f015c47b77","category":"Tech"}
