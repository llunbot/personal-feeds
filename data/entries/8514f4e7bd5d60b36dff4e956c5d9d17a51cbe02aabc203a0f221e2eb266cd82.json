His own rich history of stage racing, coupled with his experience managing professional cross-country race teams, has given him an acute appreciation not only for the benefits of a lightweight bike, but also a compliant one. That comes through in his frame design ethos; all of Thomas Stoll’s frames are made to order, and the carbon layup is tailored according to the rider’s weight and riding style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Eurobike, Stoll had two XC-dingly lightweight carbon bikes on display; a 9.9 kg 120mm travel full suspension bike, and a 5.9 kg hardtail. Let’s take a look at the components Thomas utilized to achieve those numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023.jpg\" alt=\"stoll m2.2 xc 100mm travel full suspension cross country bike eurobike 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-m2-2-xc-100mm-travel-lightweight-mtb-eurobike-2023-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Stoll M2.2 SR frame, without shock, weighs a claimed 1,990 grams</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.9 kg Stoll Bikes M2.2 SR Mountain Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stoll M2.2 is a 9.9 kg 120mm travel mountain bike built for stage racing; the carbon fiber frameset is yours for just 5,500 € (with shock and headset).
