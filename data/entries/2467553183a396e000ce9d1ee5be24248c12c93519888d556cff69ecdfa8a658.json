{"title":"South Korea Passes Law Requiring App Stores to Allow Third-Party Payment Processing for In-App Purchases","link":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-apple-hit-in-south-korea-by-worlds-first-law-ending-their-dominance-over-app-store-payments-11630403335","date":1630433620000,"content":"\n<p>Jiyoung Sohn, reporting for The Wall Street Journal from Seoul (<a href=\"https://apple.news/Ah7urLdYqQsup5v3A9tc-qg\">News+</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google and Apple Inc. will have to open their app stores to\nalternative payment systems in South Korea, threatening their\nlucrative commissions on digital sales.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s some counting of unhatched chickens in the above sentence, but that’s certainly the intention of the law.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A bill passed Tuesday by South Korea’s National Assembly is the\nfirst in the world to dent the tech giants’ dominance over how\napps on their platforms sell their digital goods. It will become\nlaw once signed by President Moon Jae-in, whose party strongly\nendorsed the legislation.</p>\n\n<p>The law amends South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act to\nprevent large app-market operators from requiring the use of their\nin-app purchasing systems. It also bans operators from\nunreasonably delaying the approval of apps or deleting them from\nthe marketplace — provisions meant to head off retaliation\nagainst app makers.</p>\n\n<p>Companies that fail to comply could be fined up to 3% of their\nSouth Korea revenue by the Korea Communications Commission, the\ncountry’s media regulator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have a rough English translation of the law, and my understanding is that the above ban on “delaying” or “deleting” apps is specifically related to retaliation for using their own payment processing. It’s not a ban on removing apps from the stores for just cause. The law even requires app store operators to take precautions against harm to users from content and “<em>to protect the rights and interests of users</em>. (I italicized rather than quoted that because, as I said, it’s a loose and very much unofficial English translation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The bill — which in Korean has been nicknamed the “Google\npower-abuse-prevention law” by some lawmakers and media — was\nwelcomed by groups representing South Korea’s internet-technology\ncompanies and startups, as well as local content developers and\napp makers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fascinating to me that the bill is nicknamed the “Google power-abuse-prevention law” in Korea, but U.S. news coverage is focused on Apple at least as much, if not more so. <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/south-korea\">StatCounter pegs Korean mobile market share at 71% Android, 28% iOS</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/31/south-korea-app-store-payment-law\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2467553183a396e000ce9d1ee5be24248c12c93519888d556cff69ecdfa8a658","category":"Tech"}
