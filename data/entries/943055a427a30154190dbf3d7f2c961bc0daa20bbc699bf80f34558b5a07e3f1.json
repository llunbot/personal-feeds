{"title":"Apple Partner TSMC Unveils Advanced 1.4nm Process for 2028 Chips","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/apple-partner-tsmc-1-4nm-process-2028-chips/","date":1745493369000,"content":"Apple chipmaker TSMC at the North America Technology Symposium has teased its next-generation A14 process node that will enter planned production in 2028.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1422\" height=\"800\" />\r<br />\nThe cutting-edge A14 node will allow for highly advanced 1.4nm chips that are likely to be utilized for future generations of Apple silicon. Compared to TSMC's N2 node, A14 promises up to 15% faster performance at the same power or up to 30% power savings at the same performance. A14 also boasts over 20% logic density improvement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTSMC said it is also evolving its TSMC NanoFlex standard cell architecture to NanoFlex Pro, enabling greater performance, power efficiency, and design flexibility. From the company's <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250423909194/en/TSMC-Unveils-Next-Generation-A14-Process-at-North-America-Technology-Symposium\">press release</a>:\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"Our customers constantly look to the future, and TSMC's technology leadership and manufacturing excellence provides them with a dependable roadmap for their innovations,\" said TSMC Chairman and CEO Dr. C.C. Wei. \"TSMC's cutting-edge logic technologies like A14 are part of a comprehensive suite of solutions that connect the physical and digital worlds to unleash our customers' innovation for advancing the AI future.\"</blockquote>It's not known which of TSMC's clients will stand to benefit first from the new 1.4nm chips, but given the close partnership between the company and Apple, it's a good bet that the latter will be at the front of the queue to place orders.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTSMC's industry-leading 2nm process is set to enter volume production later this year. Apple is not expected to introduce devices using TSMC's 2nm (N2) process node until 2026, suggesting that the iPhone 18 series will be first to adopt the technology in Apple's A20 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the iPhone 17 and the upcoming M5 chip for Macs and iPads are expected to continue to utilize TSMC's 3nm process, specifically the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/\">third-generation N3P node</a>. This decision is primarily due to the high costs and limited production capacity associated with the 2nm process at this time.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/apple-partner-tsmc-1-4nm-process-2028-chips/\">Apple Partner TSMC Unveils Advanced 1.4nm Process for 2028 Chips</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-partner-tsmc-unveils-advanced-1-4nm-process-for-2028-chips.2455871/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"943055a427a30154190dbf3d7f2c961bc0daa20bbc699bf80f34558b5a07e3f1","category":"Apple"}
