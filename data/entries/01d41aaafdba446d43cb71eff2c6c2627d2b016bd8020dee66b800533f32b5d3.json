Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\">App Store Review Guidelines</a> state (with emphasis our own):<blockquote>If we can't understand how your app works or your in-app purchases aren't immediately obvious, it will delay your review and may trigger a rejection. And while pricing is up to you, we won't distribute apps and in-app purchase items that are clear rip-offs. <strong>We'll reject expensive apps that try to cheat users with irrationally high prices.</strong></blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe fact that such apps have passed the ‌App Store‌ review process to be awarded a special feature from Apple on the ‌App Store‌ has induced outrage in some developers, such as Simeon Saëns of Two Lives Left, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twolivesleft/status/1423115528680349700?s=20\">took a closer look</a> at one of the apps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven that at least some of these apps charge $13 per week, it is difficult to not see them as breaking ‌App Store‌ guidelines, so it is particularly surprising that they were actively featured by Apple on the ‌App Store‌.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/app-store-feature-promotes-rip-off-apps/\">Developers Complain as App Store Feature Promotes Rip-Off Apps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/developers-complain-as-app-store-feature-promotes-rip-off-apps.2306605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pW84dPg1PbU:8ijFvOgj5ws:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pW84dPg1PbU:8ijFvOgj5ws:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pW84dPg1PbU\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01d41aaafdba446d43cb71eff2c6c2627d2b016bd8020dee66b800533f32b5d3","category":"Apple"}
