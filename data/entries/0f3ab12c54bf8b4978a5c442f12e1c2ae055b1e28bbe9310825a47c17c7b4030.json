Fortunately, we'll soon be getting S3, and judging by the new teaser that just dropped, we're in for another wild, mind-bending ride.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Patrol_(TV_series)#Season_3\">first two seasons</a> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>For those who may be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/review-doom-patrol-comes-back-strong-with-fierce-and-fun-s2/\">new to the series</a>, Niles Caulder (Timothy Dalton), aka the Chief, is a medical doctor who saved the lives of the various Doom Patrol members and lets them stay in his mansion. His Manor of Misfits includes Jane, aka Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), whose childhood trauma resulted in 64 distinct personalities, each with its own powers. Rita (April Bowlby), aka Elasti-Woman, is a former actress with stretchy, elastic properties she can't really control, thanks to being exposed to a toxic gas that altered her cellular structure. Larry Trainor, aka Negative Man, is a US Air Force pilot who has a \"negative energy entity\" inside him and must be swathed in bandages to keep radioactivity from seeping out of his body. (Matt Bomer plays Trainor without the bandages, while Matthew Zuk takes on the bandaged role.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785838#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0f3ab12c54bf8b4978a5c442f12e1c2ae055b1e28bbe9310825a47c17c7b4030","category":"Tech"}
