But developer Josh Simmons was in a unique position to inflict a particularly rude punishment on websites that were directly stealing and monetizing his web game <a href=\"https://www.sqword.com/\"><em>Sqword</em></a> without permission.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220417173815/https://www.sqword.com/\">its launch last year</a>, Simmons says he has attracted a \"steady group of daily active users\" for <em>Sqword</em>, which involves placing letters sequentially in a 5×5 grid to make as many valid words as possible. But as <a href=\"https://joshcsimmons.com/post/H4sIAAAAAAAA%2F0xVTY%2FjNgy951c8TA%2BzC0yCQQ9F0dte2gYosIedbdEjbdG2dmRRFakE7q8vKCebXvIBySTfB59%2FwFeNecZvQqYME3wxKfhUCt4WnuxwOKPyyNnShqHFZCAMVa7K9TiQcsBVasBMK%2BMabcG6YaqRc1CMlBIHfPmnX%2Fmg%2Ffs0yvrxhPPzilKlBe%2BptMEWMlz5%2BcIYmDNoSH2elWI2ihkENaawYa7SCmRCoJg20GjxwmjKVSEXrrCFUUgNP2GVbItCKlQQWEs0RhZDEIdNeUNlSqBw4WrRuTgdDn%2B2ZK2y4hpTAl84o8TxHWRYJbAatI0jq0JNamQ9HQ5%2FsxrXQBsks0%2B3bhglJRqkkklVzCKz8%2FG0E%2FEEyh39EhXaaqlR%2BcWHr4yrf5hk9UpTrGrHQjOjsrZkemercn62jvdBLoI4ZycXUBkajRVUGU9dJJrnyrNP9HQ767UWUcMmrYJKQcwaQ0dBGfHX6g%2Bq7Ddt4Q0j5S6HM4fqDDXGVGXda5QqoY12OhzeHN1KgeG981xjF8jLGnSRlgIWujCOXZaBR2rKd89EBWEkXTDKFUdcGUEccm0ZFBSSd%2FQuq9O5n670zi49uxdlRbQXRHtWfGtqmKRiahlHDO3RMRqu5O0KqUbJjuEbj7a7%2BmbpF6isbIt7p7S694zZOFuUTCl5Q%2B6%2BLYk2%2FHV%2B%2B%2F3z1zcf9YSzT0Azxazm7mBbRNF7Br5wksL1rr%2FrNVDO7mnvUaS0om7Ful39xgnnCee%2BksFFolJe%2FD%2BnyBf%2BH7kcvSIGl4fZN%2BFxNjBaOU5VsoEGaYbrTWFoG3SssTguf6i0Oi6kjFLjyC7Mh27fhXMXrhXllFz9jycPjdEbuBY0uJOU2TnrO%2BFekMwW%2F2UnD%2BYWudLW3cJYyXevo66sRbLGHgWddBMEwfVhm54VJqAQ3CrStYDy2Gq0DUVSHDe%2FsIfC7MSB1j7zrZOK%2B92zZYd%2FRuAxBg73bqSonMMtWZhq2vDj6%2Burdulr5k7o%2BI64%2Bo7esrT7hpCdrpVV%2FUhb4RrXIh6cPauiOQUl0djXzRv0BZzuKxDYeLxvvN%2F2ro%2B1dLINC%2BnOxCN75spkHlU0Lm6JlbM93PaLY0vxwsfAJckGwuq%2BvzDmffwdizNrSOxp%2BvMtWW6z0B4%2Ba8w%2BxB%2Fsvok%2BBgiJVX01xQ2Bo8PxH%2B7q1t83j1hxjqP2baF9j3ek6sU9TPRlT2Bf28RztLiSsRvSadSXXrl7IUs3QJV0fw%2BQfbfE0cnz2BoXyjM7LE9%2Fiyuf8DkzPLrvPpAJSeTdJ43ZObiPu3db47x4cny%2F1IvBU6By2hDiNHk2G95j7tWKVKN0OvwHAAD%2F%2FwMASc5Y2XAHAAA%3D\">noted on Simmons' blog</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/sqword-game-dev-sneaks-goatse-onto-a-dozen-sites-that-stole-his-game/\">noticed by 404 Media</a>), searching for <em>Sqword</em> also brings up several \"game aggregator\" sites that simply embed the game content from <a href=\"https://www.sqword.com/\">Sqword.com</a> in an iFrame window, only now surrounded by annoying banner ads.</p>\n<p>\"This made me angrier than it should have—not because <em>Sqword</em> is a cash cow—we don't run ads on the site and don't make money from it, it's just for fun—but because it was a passion project with friends, something pure and intentionally free to play WITHOUT ads,\" Simmons writes. \"It's against my ethos as a developer, there are banners and popups everywhere. If I build an app, I believe it should either be free or it should be upfront about what the subscription or purchase price is (and then not upsell you). I couldn't abide seeing my code monetized in this way.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977926#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977926&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ee7777c7d80fc0c4e4cb4818e312106a972b7ec8c9d6979f6325b38b03b6abe9","category":"Tech"}
