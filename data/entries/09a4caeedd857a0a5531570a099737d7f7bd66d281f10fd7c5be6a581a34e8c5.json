With the ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad mini‌ set to gain OLED display technology, most of Apple's lineup with the exception of the low-cost ‌iPad‌ is expected to feature OLED displays by 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDSCC also expects an 18.8-inch foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> with an OLED display to launch in 2027. There have been several rumors suggesting that a foldable ‌iPad‌ or MacBook will be one of Apple's first foldable devices, including a report from <em>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/\">over the weekend</a>. The <em>WSJ</em> said that Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's \"intended to serve as a laptop\" and that would unfold to be about 19 inches in size. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> also highlighted a foldable ‌iPad‌ this weekend, suggesting that the \"giant\" tablet <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/foldable-ipad-likely-set-for-2028-launch/\">would launch in 2028</a>. According to Gurman, Apple does not want the upcoming foldable device to have a crease, instead appearing as a single piece of glass. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors have been unclear on whether the upcoming foldable device will be an ‌iPad‌ or a Mac, but either is feasible depending on what operating system Apple opts to go with.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile iPhones and the Apple Watch have used OLED displays for years, it has taken time for larger OLED displays to be affordable enough for use in Macs and iPads. Apple debuted its first OLED iPads this year, introducing the 11-inch and 13-inch OLED ‌iPad Pro‌ models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/\">Foldable MacBook</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/foldable-ipad-pro-2027-launch/\">Foldable iPad Pro and OLED iPad Air Expected in 2027, OLED iPad Mini to Launch in 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-ipad-pro-and-oled-ipad-air-expected-in-2027-oled-ipad-mini-to-launch-in-2026.2445559/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"09a4caeedd857a0a5531570a099737d7f7bd66d281f10fd7c5be6a581a34e8c5","category":"Apple"}
