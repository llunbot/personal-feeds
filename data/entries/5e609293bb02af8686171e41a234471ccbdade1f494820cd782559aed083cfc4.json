Buying cheap tools is uneconomical and could lead to more harm than good.</p>\n<p>High-quality tools will make your workshop experience more rewarding and, providing you look after them, they will last you a long time.</p>\n<p>I’ve spent years working as a mechanic throughout my cycling career and the following tools are the most treasured possessions in my (ever-expanding) tool collection.</p>\n<p>They’ve survived battle wrenching in shops and on my own bikes over many years, and still see regular use, which is what makes them High Mileage Heroes.</p>\n<p>A couple of years ago, senior technical editor <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/alexevans/\">Alex Evans</a> provided a vivid look into his well-worn <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/alexs-ancient-and-favourite-tools/\">tool collection</a>. Although the very definition of High-Mileage Heroes, these alphabetised picks of my generally lust-worthy tools are the antithesis of Alex’s commendable frugality.</p>\n<h2>Abbey Crombie and Whip-It cassette tools</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I challenge you to find a better cassette tool combination.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Conceived by a colleague pro mechanic Jeff Crombie worked with, Crombie asked his friend and former bike mechanic, Jason Quade to make one of his own. This cassette lockring tool essentially kickstarted Abbey Bike Tools.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/abbey-bike-works-crombie-cassette-tool-just-in/\">Crombie</a> revolutionised cassette lockring tool designs with its elegant ‘why didn’t I think of that?’ design.

Both sides are for Shimano/SRAM HG <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassettes</a>, but one side is for hubs with a quick-release  axle and the other for thru-axle hubs.</p>\n<p>The tool fits perfectly into the lockring splines and, if you use quick-release skewers, will fit over most nuts when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-replace-cassette/\">replacing a cassette</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Crombie stores inside the Whip-It’s handle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I’ve also got a second Crombie, with one side for Shimano/SRAM HG cassettes and the other for Campagnolo.</p>\n<p>I also own socket versions of this tool in both Shimano/SRAM HG and Campagnolo variants, in case I come across a particularly stubborn cassette and need to pair it with a breaker bar.</p>\n<p>I’ve found SRAM’s cassettes on its XD and XDR freehubs have a nasty habit of fusing in place if you don’t look after them religiously, which is when the sockets come out to play.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The green-tinged KMC chain is the cherry on the cake.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Whip-It is a matching chain whip that stores conveniently in the Crombie’s handle. It, too, stands up to heavy use.</p>\n<p>The pop sound as you take the lockring tool out from the chain whip is deeply satisfying.</p>\n<p>The Crombie is also available in a Super Light variant with a hollowed-out handle, which would be great for the travelling mechanic trying to save extra grams, but overkill for me.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Abbey Bike Tools Dual Sided Thru-Axle Crombie:</strong> £64/$53</li>\n<li><strong>Abbey Bike Tools Whip-It Chain Whip:</strong> £56/$47</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Knipex 95 61 190 Wire Rope Cutter Forged</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Knipex tools are almost always a sure bet.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>A quality cable cutter is an essential when it’s time to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-replace-brake-gear-cables/\">replace your bike’s brake and gear cables</a>.

It was also my first time owning a Silca product, starting a dangerous habit.</p>\n<p>Presented in a luxurious duck-waxed canvas case (which is now beginning to show some signs of wear), the tool comprises a selection of stainless steel 1/4in S2 bits, paired with the torque and ratchet attachments.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The eagle-eyed among you will see I’ve swapped the included T10 bit for an 8mm hex PB Swiss alternative.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The handle can be converted between T and L-handles and the 72-tooth ratchet is satisfyingly smooth. It can be used as a ratchet or as a torque wrench with the Ti-Torque bar, with fasteners rated between 2 and 8Nm.</p>\n<p>The torque bar features a scale – simply follow the arrow on the bottom of the bar until it aligns with your desired torque. It’s not as foolproof as using a click-type torque wrench, but it gives me peace of mind the bolt is suitably fastened.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title

handle, the tools are forged from S2 steel and feature a sliding handle, which enables you to convert them from T to L-handles.</p>\n<p>I used these almost daily in my workshop days and I’ve used them

The 8mm has been optimised for the most leverage when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-change-bike-pedals/\">removing stubborn pedals</a> and the 10mm has been designed specifically for working on Campagnolo Ultra Torque crank bolts.</p>\n<p>While the waxed duck canvas bag the keys are presented in is also undeniably a thing of beauty, I removed the keys and included them in my travelling tool pouch.</p>\n<h2>Wera Hex-Plus Stainless L-Key Set</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All the colours!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I’m a sucker for a quality set of hex keys and the stainless steel Wera Hex-Plus set is my L-key of choice.
