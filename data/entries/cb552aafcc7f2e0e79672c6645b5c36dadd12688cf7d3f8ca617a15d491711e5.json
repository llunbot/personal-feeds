Reactions let users share how they feel within a video session, and Screen Sharing has been improved with a simplified process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs is usual with macOS updates, Safari is getting numerous new features within Sonoma. There's an update to Private Browsing that provides greater protection from trackers and from people who might have access to the user's device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits3.jpg\" alt width=\"846\" height=\"436\" />\r<br />\nProfiles within Safari offer a way to separate browsing between topics, like having one for work and one for personal browsing. There's also a new way to create web apps that work like normal apps and let you get to your favorite website faster.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen you're not actively using ‌macOS Sonoma‌, the new screen savers feature slow-motion videos of various locations worldwide. They shuffle between landscape, Earth, underwter, or cityscape themes, similar to what you'll see on tvOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-macOS-Sonoma-gaming-230605.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nFor gamers, there's a new Game Mode in ‌macOS Sonoma‌ that delivers an optimized gaming experience with smoother and more consistent frame rates. It dramatically lowers audio latency with AirPods and reduces input latency with game controllers, and it works with any game on Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlongside ‌macOS Sonoma‌, Apple at its \"Wonderlust\" event also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/ios-17-launch-date-announced-apple/\">announced the release date for iOS 17 for compatible iPhones</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/macos-sonoma-official-release-date-announced/\">macOS Sonoma to Launch on September 26, Featuring Desktop Widgets, Safari Profiles, Game Mode, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sonoma-to-launch-on-september-26-featuring-desktop-widgets-safari-profiles-game-mode-and-more.2401203/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cb552aafcc7f2e0e79672c6645b5c36dadd12688cf7d3f8ca617a15d491711e5","category":"Apple"}
