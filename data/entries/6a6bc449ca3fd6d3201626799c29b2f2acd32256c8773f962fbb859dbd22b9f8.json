Claimed to be the most versatile tyre in the range, it should be capable from hard-packed rocky trails through to soft, mixed dirt.</p>\n<p>The DualWALL enduro casing is a two-ply 120 TPI carcass with added rubber protection around the bead to increase puncture protection.</p>\n<p>A change to the Race version of the Scorpion M tyres is the dual compound. The original non-Race tyre used just one rubber compound. Now, there’s a firmer rubber layered under Pirelli’s 42a SmartEVO DH compound tread blocks.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pirelli Scorpion Race EN M tyre proile and tread blocks\" title=\"Pirelli Scorpion Race EN M tyre proile and tread blocks\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tyre profile is fairly round, so should offer predictable performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>The goal of this construction is to give improved traction and control by managing not only the softness of the rubber, but also its rebound properties.</p>\n<p>For this enduro version, there are two sizes available: 29×5.5in and 27.5×2.5in, with weights of 1,304g for our test 29er and a claimed 1,210g for a 27.5in tyre.</p>\n<ul><li>£81.99</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<h2>Sweet Protection Bushwacker V2i MIPS helmet</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sweet Protection Bushwacker 2Vi MIPS helmet sitin on a rock\" title=\"Sweet Protection Bushwacker 2Vi MIPS helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Sweet Protection’s Bushwacker V2i MIPS helmet features plenty of tech and smart features.

The hexagonal tread pattern is aimed to supply grip on the pedal and traction when walking.</p>\n<p>The mid-stiff soul should help transfer power to the pedals, while still offering enough comfort on the bike to soak up vibrations and bumps. The padded tongue has also been designed with an impact-absorbing foam, and the deep heel cup and lace system should keep them secure no matter how wild the trails.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"First Degree Flite XT shoe lacing options\" title=\"First Degree Flite XT shoe lacing options\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Flite XT has multiple lacing options to give a secure fit, and more durable leather over the Flite model for durability in rugged riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>Styling is impressive and we see a lot of people taking a second look at these.

This hand pump from Topeak can be used as a high-volume pump for inflating tyres, or a high-pressure pump for inflating air suspension.</p>\n<p>By the twist of a dial at the base of the pump, you can switch between an 84cc high-volume pump or an 11cc high-pressure pump.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Topeak Mountain Digital 2Stage pump\" title=\"Topeak Mountain Digital 2Stage pump\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A dial at the bottom of the pump enables riders to change between the high-pressure and high-volume settings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media / Luke Marshall</i></span></div>\n<p>The digital gauge can toggle between psi, bar and kg/cm2, and can record <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/trail-tech-mountain-bike-tyre-pressure-all-you-need-to-know/\">tyre pressures</a> up to 300psi/20.7 bar.</p>\n<p>The connector can be used with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/presta-vs-schrader-valves/\">Presta and Schrader valves</a>. It can be threaded or pushed on to Presta values and is threaded onto Schrader valves.
