This is about two weeks earlier than the existing public timeline for their flight home from the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>Bringing the two astronauts back to Earth next month will require some shuffling of spacecraft here on the ground and a delay of the privately operated Axiom-4 mission to the International Space Station to later in the spring.</p>\n<p>Wilmore and Williams flew to the station on Boeing's Starliner in June 2024. The plight of \"Butch and Suni,\" as they are often referred to, was a major story in the space community last summer after their Starliner spacecraft experienced significant propulsion issues before docking. NASA ultimately decided the safest course would be for the pair to return home on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle, and launched the Crew-9 mission last September with two empty seats. Thus, Butch and Suni's ride home has been docked to the station since last fall.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-moves-up-target-to-return-butch-and-suni-but-not-for-political-reasons/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-moves-up-target-to-return-butch-and-suni-but-not-for-political-reasons/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9ec9ac2f8b9e7875393e90c3ce45997d703a2b81174f86d066797702890a8fe","category":"Tech"}
