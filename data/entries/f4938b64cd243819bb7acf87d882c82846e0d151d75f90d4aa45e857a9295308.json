This is especially important at an organization like <a href=\"https://www.workday.com/\">Workday</a>, whose on‑demand financial management and human capital management software needs to scale and update on a moment's notice. Workday’s vendor platform team supported this rapid expansion and innovation by leveraging <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul\">HashiCorp Consul</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault\">HashiCorp Vault</a> as part of its critical infrastructure. Workday Principal Engineer <a href=\"https://hashiconf.com/global/speakers/daniele-vazzola/\">Daniele Vazzola</a> explained how his company uses HashiCorp tools to support deployments across multiple cloud providers and on-premises datacenters. He also detailed how this multi-cloud fabric empowers service teams to autonomously set up secure connections across datacenters between workloads running on heterogeneous platforms.</p>\n<p><em>View <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sQAKe3pq5Hc\">Workday's Multi-Cloud Network Fabric With Consul &amp; Vault</a> session.</em></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#product-news-and-keynote-highlights\">»</a><a></a>Product News and Keynote Highlights</h2>\n<p>As always, HashiConf Global 2021 was packed with news about new HashiCorp products, features, and enhancements. For starters, check out the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/hashiconf-global-2021-opening-keynote\">Day 1</a>and <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/hashiconf-2021-keynote-consul-api-gateway\">Day 2</a> keynote sessions featuring top HashiCorp execs, Sue Bohn, vice president, identity and network access division at Microsoft, and other leaders and experts:</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#a-new-collaboration-with-microsoft-to-bolster-zero-trust-security\">»</a><a></a>A New Collaboration with Microsoft to Bolster Zero Trust Security</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/19/2316793/0/en/HashiCorp-to-Collaborate-with-Microsoft-on-Secure-Remote-Access-Solution-for-Azure-Active-Directory.html\">Microsoft and HashiCorp announced</a> a strategic partnership to make <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/solutions/zero-trust-security\">zero trust security</a> more accessible with identity-based security solutions. This new stage in our partnership focuses on secure remote access, making it as easy as possible to access remote services anywhere with <a href=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/\">HashiCorp Boundary</a> leveraging trusted identities from Microsoft Active Directory. Initially announced at last year's HashiConf, Boundary is a secure remote-access solution that provides an easy way to allow access to applications and systems with fine-grained authorizations based on identities.</p>\n<p>In addition, in his <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/hashiconf-global-2021-opening-keynote\">opening keynote</a>, HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Armon Dadgar shared that we have opened applications for organizations interested in joining the<a href=\"http://hashi.co/boundary\"> Boundary Insider Program</a> to get close to the development of Boundary and so that developers can directly participate in the evolution of Boundary. Check out Boundary in action through the on-demand <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/boundary-secure-access-management-new-coming-soon\">breakout session</a>, where you can view a demo and see how users can begin using Boundary with Microsoft Azure Active Directory.</p><h3><a href=\"#hashicorp-waypoint-increases-focus-on-kubernetes\">»</a><a></a>HashiCorp Waypoint Increases Focus on Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>Also in the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/hashiconf-global-2021-opening-keynote\">opening keynote</a>, HashiCorp Co-Founder Mitchell Hashimoto gave an update on the development of <a href=\"https://www.waypointproject.io/\">HashiCorp Waypoint</a>, an open source project that simplifies how developers build, deploy, and release applications across any platform. Waypoint’s core thesis is simple: Developers just want to deploy and HashiCorp can help by enabling developers to get their applications from development to production in a single configuration file and with a unified workflow.</p>\n<p>As the Waypoint team has worked to advance these goals since the project was announced last year, we’ve observed that many users are primarily looking to simplify the complexity of Kubernetes in their deployment environments. Therefore, in the recently released <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-waypoint-0-6\">Waypoint 0.6</a> and the next few releases, HashiCorp is doubling-down on Kubernetes. Our goal is to empower operators to deliver a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) experience for Kubernetes and be able to scale that experience consistently across other popular platforms, including Amazon ECS, HashiCorp Nomad, serverless, and more.</p>\n<p><em>See a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZwAQZdWB8QQ\">real-world Waypoint product demo with Kubernetes</a> to learn more.</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#hcp-packer-public-beta-launched\">»</a><a></a>HCP Packer Public Beta Launched</h3>\n<p>Many IT teams have a gap in their automation between the creation of images and their deployment, and earlier this year, we announced<a href=\"https://www.packer.io/\"> HCP Packer </a>to address that issue. At HashiConf, Mitchell announced that this service is now available for anyone to use as it enters <a href=\"https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/packer?utm_source=packer_io&amp;utm_content=homepage_hero_packer\">full public beta</a>.
