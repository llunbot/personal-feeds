And there is no moment on Ventoux that has not been packaged into a neat anecdote and retold endlessly in the cycling media (not least by us).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy to assume that the Giant of Provence has revealed all her secrets and that there is nothing new to discover. But for all those riders who have been there, ridden to its striped summit tower and ticked it off the list, we have got something new to offer this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the hordes leave the town of Bédoin and immediately turn left to begin the ascent of Mont Ventoux’s southern slopes, we take a right and discover a ride of empty roads, vertiginous gorges, towering rock walls and roughly-hewn tunnels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tour has never come this way, so it remains a secret gem. Best of all, it still leads to a back-door ascent of Ventoux by the eastern approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be the most celebrated climb in cycling, but it seems Ventoux can still offer a few surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Matt Ben Stone</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 142?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New view on Ventoux:</strong> It’s possibly the most famous climb in cycling, but Mont Ventoux still has some surprises in store, including this route that takes in the stunning and rarely visited Les Gorges de la Nesque</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Everything everywhere:</strong> Over the past 12 years, Italian racer Elisa Longo Borghini has established herself as one of cycling’s great all-rounders. She tells Cyclist about her sporting upbringing, how she conquered her self-doubts, and how she hates coming second</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What we ride:</strong> Behind every cycling journalist is a long history of bikes. Some come and go – test bikes, first bikes, stolen bikes, I’m going to get into BMX-ing now bikes – but some stay, for their practicality, their dreaminess or just for the joy they elicit. Here are three of the Cyclist team’s personal favourites</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Susten Pass:</strong> The supersized Swiss climb</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ready to race:</strong> Starting on 23rd July, the Transcontinental Race will see riders tackle 4,000km across Europe, carrying everything they need on their bikes. Cyclist caught up with three competitors to find out their kit lists for the mammoth challenge</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all this and much more, pick up your copy of <em>Cyclist</em> issue 142, <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-142\" target=\"_blank\">on sale now</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Subscribe to <em>Cyclist</em> and get the best bikes, rides and cycling exclusives</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get three months of <em>Cyclist</em> for just £1.67 an issue (usually £6.45), delivered free of charge to your door before it hits the shops</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://cyclistmag.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to find out more and subscribe to Cyclist Magazine</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-142\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to buy Cyclist issue 142 at the Cyclist Shop</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 142: on sale now!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"75ff3ec08b2f4c0bb833493c39ee990902dc4ff8a8b4367d545e73b4c7797369","category":"Cycling"}
