They said it was the result of the company pushing updates that poisoned the devices. Windstream’s Kinetic broadband service has about <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/358319107/files/doc_downloads/2024/02/4q23-ceo-letter.pdf\">1.6 million subscribers</a> in 18 states, including Iowa, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Kentucky. For many customers, Kinetic provides an essential link to the outside world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027651#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027651&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f11e77d87b17c27beda3a6ad6abd00910b92be0030acb3615fc7704fed9d760f","category":"Tech"}
