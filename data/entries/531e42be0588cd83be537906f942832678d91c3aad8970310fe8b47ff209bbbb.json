And if it was easier to do, I suspect\nthat number would be much larger. Imagine if repairing a cracked\ndisplay was a simple, five minute operation. Wouldn’t you rather\norder the new display and make the swap yourself?</p>\n\n<p>It used to be relatively easy to customize and repair your gear.\nAs parts have given way to part assemblies (glued/soldered\nassemblies that become a single replaceable requirement, even if a\nsingle part fails) and the quest for smaller makes devices harder\nto open, harder to take apart, the ability to repair your own gear\nhas become harder, almost impossible.</p>\n\n<p>So those small numbers John points out are real. But should this\nbe the way it is? Again, wouldn’t you love the ability to swap out\na display as easily as you used to be able to swap out RAM on your\nold Macs?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ideally, many people would still like to be able to swap out RAM on today’s Macs as easily as we could on old Macs. Same thing for SSD storage. Adding RAM and storage, years after purchase, was a great way to significantly extend the practical lifetime of Macs. A while back (15 years ago?) I replaced the spinning hard drive in a 15-inch PowerBook with an SSD, and it was like buying a brand-new much faster machine.</p>\n\n<p>But: times change. Apple hasn’t moved away from user replaceable memory and storage components out of spite. Integrating memory and storage into the chips themselves is the reason why devices have gotten thinner and lighter and much, much faster. The incredible performance of Apple silicon — for both iOS devices and Macs — is part and parcel with integrating memory and storage directly onto the SoCs.</p>\n\n<p>And in terms of replacing screens on iPhones, consider waterproofing and device aesthetics. To my knowledge, no company makes a mainstream smartphone with an easily-replaced display, because a smartphone with an easily replaced screen wouldn’t sell because of all the design trade-offs that would be involved.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/19/mark-repairability\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"531e42be0588cd83be537906f942832678d91c3aad8970310fe8b47ff209bbbb","category":"Tech"}
