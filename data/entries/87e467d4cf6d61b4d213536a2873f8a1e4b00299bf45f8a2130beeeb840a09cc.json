The history of gravel at Grand Tours</a></p>\n\n<p>This weekend will see gravel roads return to the Grand Tour stage. Sunday’s Giro d’Italia offering, from Gubbio to Siena, will be an ode to Strade Bianche, following many of its iconic <em>sterrato</em> sections as well as the same nail-biting finale up the steep Via Santa Caterina. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third time since 2021 that the men’s Giro d’Italia has visited the Tuscan gravel, but the Giro isn’t alone in its embrace of white roads. The Tour de France Femmes in 2022 utilised the <em>chemins blancs</em> for the first time in the modern era, with the men following suit in 2024. As interest continues to soar in gravel racing, these off-tarmac tracks have quickly become a must-have in Grand Tour route design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for the dust to be kicked up once again, we look back on the recent history of gravel at Grand Tours, charting the changes over time and how influential the stages have <em>actually</em> been in the general classification once all is said and done.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>A modern revival</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/05024955/ofs_giro_2010_74-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"ofs_giro_2010_74\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel isn’t exactly a new thing. Grand Tours were almost wholly raced on this kind of surface before the vast majority of roads across Italy, France and Spain were tarmacked in the post-War period. So, how did we regress to gravel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking a leaf from the gritty sport of old, the Eroica sportive was launched in the late 1990s. The event strictly allows vintage bikes to take part on a route that traverses the <em>sterrato </em>of Tuscany in homage to racing from the last century. After a popular maiden decade, a pro race was created to mirror the Eroica: Strade Bianche. Founded in 2007, it was an instant success, attracting some of the biggest names in the sport to take to the gravel roads of Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like how cobblestones were added into the Tour de France back in the early 2010s, it was natural for the Giro d’Italia to start adopting its most popular off-road terrain into their own three-week race. Three years on from Strade Bianche’s inaugural edition, the Giro d’Italia embraced the race and threw in a gravelled stage on the seventh day of racing, giving Grand Tour racing its first gravel-specific stage in several decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A landslide forced the organisers to rejig the course overnight, but a hefty 20km of gravel in the final phase would remain on the agenda. Naturally, rain and low temperatures made the roads more of a mudbath, with riders coated in dirt from head to toe after the first <em>strade bianche </em>sector with 30km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It proved influential in the GC classification, as the mud-caked GC favourites of Alexander Vinokourov, Damiano Cunego and Cadel Evans leapt off the front to contest the stage win. As we’ll discuss later on, these time gaps would influence the final make-up of the podium, leaving many wondering whether gravel could make a return to the Giro in the years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the best rides, bikes, kit and pro interviews every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coming back into fashion</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-19-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a decade hiatus, Tuscan gravel made its comeback on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gallery-the-day-the-giro-ditalia-visited-the-strade-bianche\">Stage 11 of the 2021 Giro d’Italia</a>. This would kick-start a gravel revival at Grand Tours, in which the white roads would become the newest toy for Giro and Tour organisers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons behind this. At a pro level, there are more gravel races nowadays. Not only that, they are also very popular. The obvious example here is Strade Bianche, which was promoted to the WorldTour level as recently as 2017, becoming one of Italy’s top races. More generally though, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/gravel\">gravel</a> has become one of the fastest-growing disciplines within cycling. Since road bikes can handle the hardpack gravel surfaces like those seen at Grand Tours, it was a natural choice to marry the two up at a Grand Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proof was in the pudding, however. The stage in 2021, which featured over 30km of white roads, was a real highlight of that year’s edition, with Egan Bernal extending his gap in the pink jersey standings. In response, other race organisers jumped on the bandwagon and looked to include more gravel stages.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

has been a little more pragmatic with gravel. Without the pedigree of Strade Bianche to lean on, it took some time for organiser ASO to settle on roads suitable enough for the Tour de France to race on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following on from the Giro’s return to the <em>sterrato </em>in 2021, the Grande Boucle’s first gravel-dedicated stage was in the inaugural Tour de France Femmes in 2022. Mechanics were aplenty on the day, but overall the stage looked great on TV, with Marlen Reusser sailing away to a well-earned stage victory in Bar-sur-Aube. It wasn’t particularly influential in terms of the final GC – apart from Mavi García, who’d lose two minutes on the gravel – but it was convincing enough of an experiment for ASO to consider it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was then thrown into the men’s race in 2024, with a gravel-focussed route around the vineyards of Troyes. When revealed in the autumn before the race, it was immediately met with a mixed reaction, with Remco Evenepoel – who lost several minutes at the 2021 Giro’s gravel stage – questioning why the organisers would think to include gravel on a Grand Tour, while Jonas Vingegaard described it as an ‘unnecessary risk’.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How has gravel affected the GC?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06113340/giroditalia2021-stage11-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"giroditalia2021-stage11-3\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With its Classics heritage, the inclusion of gravel in recent years has sparked similar debates to the Roubaix <em>pavé</em>, which crept into Tour <em>parcours </em>in the early 2010s. Talks of bike modifications, Grand Tour impurity and unnecessary risks have all come with gravel’s recent uptake in the Giro and Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans, gravel stages have been a real crowd-pleaser. Of course, they look fantastic on TV, as riders kick up clouds of white dust through the peloton. Their novelty gets fans and pros talking, given that gravel requires a different skill set for Grand Tour contenders and is another opportunity, outside of the mountain stages and time-trials, for big time gaps. This begs the question: how much has gravel actually affected the GC outcome of a Grand Tour?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are certain factors to bear in mind here. No two gravel stages are the same. Elevation gain and amount of gravel are, of course, influential in how the stage pans out. In terms of their GC influence, the position of the gravel-dedicated stages is also important when discussing their influence on the GC state of play. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Grand Tour stages since 2010 with the most gravel</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Giro d’Italia 2021 Stage 11 (35km)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tour de France 2024 Stage 9 (32km)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giro d’Italia 2025 Stage 9 (29km)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Giro d’Italia 2010 Stage 7 (20km)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tour de France Femmes 2022 Stage 4 (13km)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Giro d’Italia 2024 Stage 6 (12km)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gravel and GC: Crunching the numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-1232981946-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Factoring in the eventual implications of the final GC standings, average time lost to the race leader and GC volatility, the most influential gravel stages were the two that finished in Montalcino.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eleventh stage of the 2021 Giro d’Italia, which included 35km of gravel and around 2,500m of elevation gain, was ultimately one of the most decisive in that year’s Giro as a whole. Every rider inside the overall top 20 either moved up or down the GC following the stage, bar race leader Egan Bernal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Colombian, who was already in the pink jersey, would gain a substantial amount of time, bringing home a gap of 26 seconds over eventual podium finishers Damiano Caruso and Simon Yates. Looking deeper, the average amount of time lost to Bernal for the Giro’s final top ten sits at a remarkable 1min 38sec – the second-highest average time loss in the entire 2021 edition. Several eventual finishers in the top ten would shed several minutes on the stage, including Dan Martin, João Almedia, Romain Bardet and Dani Martínez. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1703\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Cycling : 93th Giro d'Italia 2010 / Stage 7 Illustration Illustratie / Dario Cioni (Ita)/ Marina di Carrara - Montalcino (222 Km)/ Tour of Italy / Ronde van Italie / Rit Etape / (c) Tim De Waele (Photo by Tim de Waele/Corbis via Getty Images)\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-1536x1022.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-2048x1363.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-533209548-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On its return to Grand Tour racing, the gravel stage at the 2010 Giro d’Italia, which came on day seven, was also fairly influential for that year’s Corsa Rosa. Despite featuring just 20km of gravel, the stage goes down as the most attritional, with most riders crossing the line either on their own or in a small group. The miserable weather conditions and muddy nature of the gravel roads played their part, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-term GC effects of the 2010 stage were greater than those of 2021. If it weren’t for the gravel stage, Vincenzo Nibali would have climbed up to second in the overall classification instead of third, while second-place finisher David Arroyo would have fallen to fourth if it weren’t for his strong showing. For the stage’s runner-up Alexander Vinokourov, the stage not only meant that he’d move into the <em>maglia rosa</em>, but it also secured him a sixth place in the eventual GC rankings instead of a potential eighth place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a statistical perspective, the stage saw the top ten in GC move an average of 1min 32sec in the overall rankings, just a couple of seconds shy of the average from 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/03041655/cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_4-04398-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_4-04398\" /><figcaption>CyclingImages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the remaining three gravel stages, their impact on the final GC has been significantly smaller. Much shorter in its gravel kilometres, at just 13km, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-stage-4-gallery-reusser\">Stage 4 of the 2022 Tour de France Femmes</a> saw a couple of changes in the final GC. The average time loss in the top ten to the race leader was just 13 seconds, but that’s a deceiving figure given that only three of the final top ten were in a different group to eventual champion Annemiek van Vleuten. Specifically, the only GC implications from the gravel can be spotted in the lower ranks of top ten. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through her misfortunes on the day, Mavi García shed 91 seconds, a gap that would ultimately cost her a couple of places in the top ten. Évita Muzic and Vernoica Ewers, the eventual eighth and ninth place finishers in the GC, would gain a small 16 second gap on Van Vleuten, but that would be of little use once the race conclude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a large proportion of the stage being off-road, the 2024 Tour de France’s 32km of gravel tracks were fairly unremarkable in terms of the final GC standings. This wasn’t without the intent of Pogačar, Vingegaard and Evenepoel to light things up on the <em>chemins</em> <em>blancs</em>, attacking several times, including catching up to the breakaway before actively dropping back to the main peloton. On the finish line in Troyes, they rolled over the line together with most of the GC favourites. The only eventual top ten finisher to either gain or lose time to Pogačar on the gravel would be Derek Gee, who managed to sneak in a couple of minutes from the day’s lucky breakaway. Overall, this gravel debut for the men’s Tour was more about the breakaway than it was about the GC dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To round things out, the least influential gravel stage was Stage 6 of last year’s Giro d’Italia. In all fairness, this is the stage with the least amount of gravel-allocated kilometres at just 12km. Behind surprise stage winner Pelayo Sanchez of Movistar, all the eventual top ten finishers would finish in the same group as Tadej Pogačar. In terms of GC volatility, no riders inside the top 14 of the overall standings would move in their placings, with only a few small gaps looking further down the classification. Yes, the small amount of gravel on offer can explain the relative lack of GC action, but also bear in mind that that stage was just before both a big mountain stage and the race’s first time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to expect from Sunday’s stage</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1280\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile.webp 1280w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Giro-2025-stage-9-profile-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Going into Sunday’s stage, we can probably expect some GC movement. Given that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Sunday’s stage will see a total of 29.5km of gravel roads</a>, a number just shy of the game-changing 2021 stage, we could expect a real fight for the pink jersey on this Strade Bianche-esque route. The terrain will be tough, with ramps touching double-digit gradients on some <em>sterrato </em>sections, including Strade Bianche favourite Colle Pinzuto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are few gravel specialists on the start line. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-favourites\">The main GC favourites</a> of Primož Roglič and Juan Ayuso have dodged Strade Bianche in recent years, so this could make the two quite cagey. Egan Bernal, on the other hand, will relish the chance to stretch his legs again and pull out an advantage in the GC, much like he did in 2021. Bouncing with confidence after a strong performance to Tagliacozzo on Stage 7, he can feel confident about his chances. Likewise, Mexican Isaac del Toro has a decent record in gravel races, perhaps pointing towards a potential stage victory and pink jersey stint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the GC gaps are quite tight at the moment, any chance to get an advantage on their rivals would be welcomed for the overall contenders. The final top ten is nowhere near being decided, and with a rest day right after this stage, there’s no reason to hold back, particularly with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2025\">the steep launchpad of the Via Santa Caterina</a> during the final kilometre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weather can play a huge role on stages like this, as displayed with the 2010 Giro. As of the time of writing, weather forecasts point towards a dry stage. There’s a 20% chance of rain, with none expected before the Giro arrives at the weekend. With that, expect a dry run on the gravel and plenty of fireworks at the head of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gravel-at-grand-tours\">Classic or gimmick?
