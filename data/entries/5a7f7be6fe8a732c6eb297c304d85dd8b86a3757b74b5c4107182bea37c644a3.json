To start, the company planned to auction off three NFTs that represented the opportunity to be inserted into the game as a \"metahuman\" NPC through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI2nsbKdaoU&amp;t=202s\">the company's photogrammetry scanning process</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-a-metaverse-of-blockchain-nfts-and-weve-asked-the-developers-why/\">an interview with WCCFTech</a>, GSC Game World CEO Evgeniy Grygorovych said that after the initial auction, \"the owner of the metahuman will be able to trade the right to be a metahuman [NFT] until a certain date before the official game release\" (that release is planned for April 28, 2022). In February, a second planned NFT drop would have offered vaguely defined and \"highly secretive genesis packs\" that \"won’t influence the gameplay itself or give in-game advantages over other players,\" Grygorovych said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821468#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821468&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a7f7be6fe8a732c6eb297c304d85dd8b86a3757b74b5c4107182bea37c644a3","category":"Tech"}
