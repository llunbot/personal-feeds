Crucially, there’s also no mechanical option for Shimano’s new second-tier groupset.</p>\n<p>As Shimano’s top-tier groupset, Dura-Ace historically launches ahead of Ultegra, which then typically follows a year later. This time round, however, the Japanese firm is launching both groupsets at the same time.</p>\n<p>As a result, the new Ultegra groupset series brings all the technical advantages of the latest 12-speed, semi-wireless pro-level Dura-Ace system at a more accessible price point. (The rim brake Ultegra Di2 groupset is still fully wired).</p>\n<p>Ultegra Di2 isn’t exactly an ‘every person’ groupset, but with current <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/vitus-zx-1-evo-crs-ultegra-di2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">R8070-equipped bikes appearing from around £4,000</a> it’s in the realm of your serious cyclist, rather than the WorldTour-level price tags associated with Dura-Ace Di2.</p>\n<p>We’ll focus on Ultegra Di2 in this story.

That said, my colleague, Matthew Loveridge, has been very impressed with shifting – and front shifting, in particular – on the new Dura-Ace groupset.</p>\n<p>Shimano has also been working to control shifting vibration and noise with its new cassette-tooth ramping profiles.</p>\n<p>Shimano claims the new cassette profiles give ‘shockless’ shifting even under the heaviest of pedal loads, so you’ll never have to back off accelerating or soft pedal to shift with this new design, which Shimano has coined Hyperglide+.</p>\n<h2>A dozen gears</h2>\n<p>Unlike rivals SRAM, with its AXS group, Shimano’s transition to 12-speed for its electronic drivetrains hasn’t meant a re-shaping of the gearing. To recap, the launch of 12-speed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">SRAM Red eTap AXS</a> saw SRAM reduce chainring sizes, while also introducing a 10-tooth sprocket on the cassette.</p>\n<p>Instead, Shimano is sticking steadfastly to the regular 52/36t and 50/34t chainset options. There are two cassette options of 11-30t and 11-34t (Dura-Ace does get a massive 54/40 chainset and an 11-28 cassette option as well, if you’re looking for that truly pro-level gearing).</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-18-ee00e21.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The new design front mech promises faster, smoother shifting and a smaller profile.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-19-2e7c8e9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The rear mech is now also the charging port for the Di2 battery.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-20-1f635e8.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There is also a function button allowing you to switch shift modes on the rear mech too.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nSo what’s Shimano’s reasoning for shifting to 12-speed? The addition of a twelfth sprocket has allowed Shimano to broaden the ‘sweet spot’ between the sixth, seventh and eighth sprockets. As a result, this is the progression for the two Ultegra cassette options:\n<ul><li><strong>11-30:</strong> 11-12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21-24-27-30</li>\n<li><strong>11-34:</strong> 11-12-13-14-15-17-19-21-24-27-30-34</li>\n</ul><p>The sportier 11-30t cassette has single-tooth jumps for the first eight gears, which should create a super-smooth platform for your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a>, whereas the broader 11-34 gets five one-tooth jumps before moving to two-tooth jumps for the next three again, offering progression with narrower gaps than the existing 11-speed cassettes.</p>\n<h2>Power to the people</h2>\n<p>Shimano’s entry into the power meter world has been a little slower than we expected. Where SRAM has continued to bring power measurement down to more affordable price points with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-rival-axs/\" target=\"_blank\">Rival AXS</a>, Shimano has seemed to be content in just having its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/shimano-dura-ace-r9100-p-power-meter-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Dura-Ace power meter</a> and relying on third-party brands to adapt its existing chainsets (including the two options linked below).</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/stages-dura-ace-g3-l-r-power-meter-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Stages Dura-Ace G3 L-R Power Meter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/4iiii-precision-dura-ace-9000-power-meter-review/\" target=\"_blank\">4iiii Precision Dura-Ace 9000 power meter</a></li>\n</ul><p>That’s all set to change, though, with the new Ultegra-grade power meter that launches alongside the new groupset.</p>\n<p>This dual-sided FC-R8100-P power meter is built into the new shape of the R8100 chainset and Shimano claims it will provide 300+ hours of riding from its waterproof, integrated Li-ion battery.</p>\n<p>Dual-sided data measurement comes from Shimano’s strain gauges in both crank arms and data is transmitted in Bluetooth and ANT+.

With performance between the two groups, both mechanical and electronic, being so slight, why would you choose the more expensive option aside from some weight savings, aesthetics and sheer want?</p>\n<p>With the new 12-speed Di2 systems, we think that’s set to become even cloudier, with the weight differences now even closer.</p>\n<p>For example, the new smaller front mechs differ by just 20g (about the weight of a mouse). The rear mech is just 37g heavier (or about the same as a packet of cheese and onion crisps).</p>\n<p>Even with the big mechanical items, the difference isn’t much – the cassette is about 73g heavier and the chainset just 21g more in a 52/36t chainring setup. Continuing the theme, the shifters are just 41g heavier per pair and the (disc) brakes 53g heftier (pair).</p>\n<p>In fact, the total groupset weight is 278g heavier. For context, a full 500ml bottle weighs in at over 640g, so we’re not talking huge differences here across the board.</p>\n<p>When you factor in that both new Di2 groups effectively share the same mechanics and electronics, any compelling reason for Dura-Ace seems to disappear further.</p>\n<p>Is Dura-Ace set to become the pro-only group where small gram savings are more important than budgets?</p>\n<h3>Shimano Ultegra R8100 vs Ultegra R8000 vs Dura-Ace 9200 vs Dura-Ace 9100 weight comparison</h3>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿</th><th>Ultegra Di2</th><td></td><th>Dura-Ace Di2</th><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td>R8000 (g)</td><td>New R8100 (g)</td><td>R9100 (g)</td><td>New R9200 (g)</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Drivetrain</b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>        </tr><tr><td>Rear derailleur</td><td>240</td><td>262</td><td>197</td><td>215</td>        </tr><tr><td>Front derailleur</td><td>133</td><td>116</td><td>104</td><td>96</td>        </tr><tr><td>Cassette (11-30T)</td><td>269</td><td>297</td><td>211</td><td>223</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chain</td><td>257</td><td>252</td><td>246</td><td>242</td>        </tr><tr><td>Crankset (52-36t, 170 mm w/PM)</td><td></td><td>769</td><td>695</td><td>748</td>        </tr><tr><td>Crankset (52-36t, 170 mm)</td><td>681</td><td>711</td><td>624</td><td>690</td>        </tr><tr><td>Bottom bracket</td><td>66</td><td>66</td><td>54</td><td>54</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Shifters and brakes (pair)</b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>        </tr><tr><td>Shifter (pair)</td><td>360</td><td>391</td><td>320</td><td>350</td>        </tr><tr><td>Brake caliper (pair)</td><td>285</td><td>282</td><td>250</td><td>229</td>        </tr><tr><td>Brake hose</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>60</td>        </tr><tr><td>Rotor</td><td>251</td><td>212</td><td>234</td><td>212</td>        </tr><tr><td>SM cable/EW</td><td>39.9</td><td>14.5</td><td>39.9</td><td>14.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>50</td><td>53</td><td>50</td><td>53</td>        </tr><tr><td>JCT-A (EW-RS910)</td><td>6.4</td><td></td><td>6.4</td><td></td>        </tr><tr><td>JCT-B (SM-JC41)</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>4</td><td></td>        </tr><tr><td>Wireless unit (EW-WU111)</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td><td></td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Total (no power meter)</b></td><td><b>2,705.3</b></td><td><b>2,716.5</b></td><td><b>2,403.3</b></td><td><b>2,438.5</b></td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Finally, wheels deserving of the Shimano name</h2>\n<p>For too long now, Shimano’s wheel offerings have been… how would you say?

The construction has been focused on increasing drivetrain rigidity and Shimano claims a 9 per cent increase in stiffness over the current Dura-Ace C40-TL.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-26-02a204d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The new C36, 36mm deep wheel is aimed at those who like to climb without losing out on aero gains.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-25-2d7bd17.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Ultegra now gets a full carbon wheel line-up with a new hooked tubeless rim design too.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-28-ee2a2e0.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The C50 is aimed at the all-rounder with good aero performance balanced with good weight.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-27-73ffc37.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The rim design at 28mm wide and with a 21mm internal stays consistent throughout the wheel range.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-29-fec8c59.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The C60 at 60mm deep is the tallest offering in the Ultegra range.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/New-Shimano-Ultegra-Di2-30-b01e088.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The C60 is the choice for sprinters and TT’ers alike.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Shimano</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe C36 wheelset is aimed at riders who like to climb because it offers the best combination of low weight with the aerodynamic rim shape.\n<p>The 1,488g claimed weight is heavier than the new Dura-Ace equivalent (1,350g) but on par for a £1,260 wheelset.  For comparison, Hunt’s similarly-deep 35 Carbon Aero wheels weigh in at 1,357g (£859), whereas <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/roval-rapide-c38/\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Roval C38 wheels</a> (£1,250) come in at 1,600g a pair.</p>\n<p>The C50 is designed as the all-rounder’s choice with its 50m-deep rim and 1,570g claimed weight for the pair.

As soon as our bike arrives, we’ll get it thoroughly tested and report back.</p>\n<h2>Shimano Ultegra Di2 R8100 pricing</h2>\n<h3>Bottom bracket cups</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Bottom bracket cups:</strong> £34.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Chainsets</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>FC-8100-P (with power meter, 52/36 and 50/34 chainring options):</strong> £999.99</li>\n<li><strong>FC-8100 (52/36 and 50/34 chainring options):</strong> £299.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Cassettes</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>CS-R8100 (11-30 or 11-34):</strong> £119.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Chain</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>CN-M8100 XT/Ultegra with quick link:</strong> £44.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Rear derailleur</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>RD-8150 e-tube for SD300 wires:</strong> £379.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Front derailleur</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>FD-R8150:</strong> £249.99</li>\n<li><strong>Seat tube adaptors:</strong> £16.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Gear shifters (STI)</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>ST-R8150 for mechanical brakes pair:</strong> £399.99 (or £199.99 each)</li>\n<li><strong>ST-R8170 hydraulic disc pair with BR-R8170 flat-mount calipers:</strong> £449.99 each</li>\n<li><strong>ST-R8170 shifters only:</strong> £349.99 each</li>\n</ul><h3>Shift switches</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>SW-RS801-S sprint shifters pair:</strong> £119.99</li>\n<li><strong>SW-RS801-T Top bar shifters:</strong> £119.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Brakes</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>R8100 direct-mount rim brake front:</strong> £79.99</li>\n<li><strong>R8100 direct-mount rim brake rear:</strong> £79.99</li>\n<li><strong>R8110 direct-mount front:</strong> £89.99</li>\n<li><strong>R8110-RS seatstay direct-mount rear:</strong> £89.99</li>\n<li><strong>R8170 caliper flat-mount front (with adaptors):</strong> £74.99</li>\n<li><strong>R8170 caliper flat-mount rear (no adaptors):</strong> £74.99</li>\n<li><strong>RT-MT800 Ice Tech FREEZA rotor (with lockring):</strong> £49.99</li>\n<li><strong>Flat-mount road caliper adaptor (rear) 160mm:</strong> £13.99</li>\n</ul><h3>E-tube SEIS Di2 cables</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>150mm–860mm wires:</strong> £24.99–£28.99</li>\n</ul><h3>E-tube SEIS Di2 bottom bracket junction</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Two-port:</strong> £20.99</li>\n<li><strong>Four-port:</strong> £27.99</li>\n<li><strong>E-Tube SEIS Di2 battery:</strong> £174.99</li>\n<li><strong>EQ-EC300 charger:</strong> £44.99</li>\n</ul><h3>Wheels</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Ultegra R8170-C60-TL C60 carbon clincher F12 front:</strong> £579.99</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra R8170-C60-TL C60 carbon clincher R12 rear:</strong> £679.99</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra R8170-C50-TL C60 carbon clincher F12 front:</strong> £579.99</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra R8170-C50-TL C60 carbon clincher R12 rear:</strong> £679.99</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra R8170-C36-TL C60 carbon clincher F12 front:</strong> £579.99</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra R8170-C36-TL C60 carbon clincher R12 rear:</strong> £679.99</li>\n</ul>","author":"Warren Rossiter","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f86dd5fc1069a2053d2740f881bea7f8a398d7f52686505df07947366cf88d0e","category":"Cycling"}
