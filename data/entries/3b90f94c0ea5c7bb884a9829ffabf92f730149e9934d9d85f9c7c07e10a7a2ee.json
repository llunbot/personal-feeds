The evidence is starting to pile up that the division is going down the tubes. The latest is news from <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/google-reorganization-in-assistant-follows-bard-launch-memo-says.html\">CNBC's Jennifer Elias</a> that says the Google Assistant division has been \"reshuffled\" to \"heavily prioritize\" Bard over the Google Assistant. It all sounds like the team is being reassigned.</p>\n<p>We'll get into the report details in a minute, but first a quick recap of the past two years of what the Assistant has gone through under Google:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Google Assistant saw eight major speaker/smart display hardware releases in five years from 2016-2021, but the hardware releases seem to have stopped. The last Assistant hardware release was in March 2021. That was two full years ago.</li>\n<li>2022 saw Google <em>remove</em> Assistant support from two in-house product lines: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/nest-wifi-pro-adds-6e-and-2-ethernet-ports-removes-backward-compatibility/\">Nest Wi-Fi</a> and <a href=\"https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sense-2/No-Google-Assistant-on-Sense-2/td-p/5225251\">Fitbit wearables</a>.</li>\n<li>2022 also saw a report from <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-threat-from-apple-google-tries-new-hardware-playbook\">The Information</a> that said Google wanted to \"invest less in developing its Google Assistant voice-assisted search for cars and for devices not made by Google.\"</li>\n<li>The Google Assistant's driving mode was <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/10/07/google-assistant-driving-mode-dashboard/\">shut down in 2022</a>.</li>\n<li>The Google Assistant's \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/the-google-assistants-automatic-website-navigation-feature-is-dead/\">Duplex on the web</a>\" feature was also shut down in 2022.</li>\n<li>One of the Google Assistant's core unique features, Reminders, is being shut down in favor of <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/02/11/google-tasks-reminders/\">Google Task Reminders</a> soon.</li>\n<li>The Google Assistant has never made money. The hardware is sold at cost, it doesn't have ads, and nobody pays a monthly fee to use the Assistant. There's also the significant server cost to process all those voice commands, though some newer devices have moved to on-device processing in a stealthy cost-cutting move. The Assistant's biggest competitor, Amazon Alexa, is in the same boat and loses <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/\">$10 billion a year</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each one of those developments could maybe be dismissed individually, but together they start to paint the familiar picture of a looming Google shutdown.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927818#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927818&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b90f94c0ea5c7bb884a9829ffabf92f730149e9934d9d85f9c7c07e10a7a2ee","category":"Tech"}
