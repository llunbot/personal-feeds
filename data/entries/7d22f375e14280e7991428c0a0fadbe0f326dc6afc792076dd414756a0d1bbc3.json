And this year’s race was no exception, racing through the Auvergne region, into the Jura mountains and the Alps. Racing through timeless villages and tackling classic climbs, the Dauphiné is like an appetiser for the main dish that will be served in July. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>“It’s probably the greatest week-long race,” Jonas Vingegaard said in the final press conference at the end of a great week of racing. The Dane won two stages in convincing fashion – including the queen stage to the summit of the Col de la Croix de Fer – and in doing so, demonstrated that he is more than ready to defend his Tour title next month. </span></p>\n<p><span><em>Rouleur</em> photojournalist James Startt was at the Dauphiné, capturing the action and </span>atmosphere from this year's race. </p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01stg01_peloton03_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686561837\" alt /></span><span>The peloton rolls through the opening stage over the lush hills of the Auvergne region in central France, a region that the Tour will visit for several days in July as well.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02stg01_herregodts02_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686561851\" alt />Up-and-coming Belgian, Rune Herregodts (Intermaché-Circus-Wanty), nearly upset the favourites in the opening stage, soloing away from his breakaway companions in the final kilometers, only to be caught in the final 20 meters. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/03stg01_laporte04_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686561874\" alt /><span>Frenchman Christophe Laporte continues to strike gold for his Jumbo-Visma team as he stormed to victory on stage one, a feat he would repeat on stage three. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/04stg02_peloton_hotel_amb_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686561896\" alt /></span></span><span><span>The yellow jersey races past a forgotten hotel and restaurant on stage two. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/05stg02_laporte_alaphilippe01_dauphine_2023_9011bf7c-fe17-47a7-8f64-456b1263776f.jpg?v=1686561939\" alt />Both Christophe Laporte (left) and Julian Alaphilippe (right) could be seen at the front in the final kilometers of stage two.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06stg02_Alaphilippe_remake_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686561986\" alt />Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe (Soudal-Quick-Step) couldn’t have been happier get a taste of victory once again after a frustration spring.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/07stg03_fans01_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686562050\" alt /></span></span><span><span>The famous <em>bleu, blanc</em> and<em> rouge </em>colours of the French flag offered a familiar backdrop along the roads of the Dauphiné this year. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/08stg03_fans03_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686562111\" alt />The pack races through a small village under the attentive eye of some locals as they make their way to the Rhône River Valley. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/09stg04_Bjerg03_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686562141\" alt /><span>A</span><span>ll eyes were on Jonas Vingegaard in the 31.1km mid-week time trial.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/10stg04_bjerg_finish_TT_dauphine_2023.jpg?v=1686562183\" alt />Danish time trial specialist Mikkel Bjerg (UAE Team Emirates) scored his first professional win with a stunning ride in the time trial on stage four.
