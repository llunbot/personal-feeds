The authors contend that gaining a better understanding of atypical seismic signals like those generated by the Swift concert could improve the analysis of seismic signals in the future, as well as bolster emerging applications like using signals from train noise for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_interferometry\">seismic interferometry</a>.</p>\n<p>Concert tremor consists of low-frequency signals of extended duration with harmonic frequency peaks between 1 and 10 Hz, similar to the signals generated by volcanoes or trains. There has been considerable debate about the source of these low-frequency concert tremor signals: Are they produced by the synchronized movement of the crowd, or by the sound systems or instruments coupled to the stage? Several prior studies of stadium concerts have argued for the former hypothesis, while a <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70189620\">2015 study</a> found that a chanting crowd at a football game produced similar harmonic seismic tremors. However, a <a href=\"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/79/4/546/143430/Seismic-Raves-Tremor-Observations-from-an\">2008 study</a> concluded that such signals generated during an outdoor electronic dance music festival came from the sound system vibrating to the musical beat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010047#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010047&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4cd7a5a9a33170a0c6589647c65381f3413c11f0bdbe2a604c75ba83955a9d84","category":"Tech"}
