North St. has revised a few of their bags for 2024, including two sizes of panniers and a trunk bag. They’ve also announced an all-new handlebar bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand’s former ‘Adventure Micro Pannier’ has now been split into two smaller and larger models called the Adventure Micro and Adventure Macro Panniers. Their Roll-Top Trunk Bag has also been redesigned with a better top opening and a more secure bike attachment. Finally, the new Handlebar Pack offers convenient storage for small items you wish to keep close at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Handlebar Pack:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-front.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"915\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-front.jpg\" alt=\"North St. Handlebar Pack, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-front.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-front-297x226.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-front-120x92.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-front-768x586.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An all-new item from North St. is the simply named Handlebar Pack. The pack’s sleek and simple design offers a 2.8L capacity. The Handlebar Pack is made from EcoPak fabric (a 100% recycled sailcloth), and includes a stiffener panel to hold the bag’s shape.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>6” Nano Voile straps and a shock-cord stabilizer attach the pack to your bike, and D-ring tabs make it possible to add an optional shoulder strap for convenient off-bike carrying.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-backside.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1020\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-backside.jpg\" alt=\"North St. Handlebar Pack, backside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-backside.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-backside-297x252.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-backside-120x102.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Handlebar-Pack-backside-768x653.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for storage, the main pocket features an internal organizer and a key clip. Additional internal pocket add-ons are available to further divide your cargo, which attach via hook-and-loop. One clever touch is the rider-facing mesh pouches that hold items within view and at easy access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Handlebar Pack’s dimensions are 9” x 5” x 3.75”, and it weighs 7.2oz. North St. is offering five standard in stock colors (Ocean Blue, Coyote, Teal, Blazer Orange or Black), plus eight more made-to-order color combinations. MSRP is $95.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adventure Micro Pannier:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Adventure-Micro-pannier-on-rack.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Adventure-Micro-pannier-on-rack.jpg\" alt=\"North St. Adventure Micro Pannier, on rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Adventure-Micro-pannier-on-rack.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Adventure-Micro-pannier-on-rack-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Adventure-Micro-pannier-on-rack-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Adventure-Micro-pannier-on-rack-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/North-St-Adventure-Micro-pannier-on-rack-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Adventure Micro Pannier boasts a streamlined design with a 14L capacity. North St. has redesigned and improved the hook-and-loop strap system that attaches the bag to your rack.
