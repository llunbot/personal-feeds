The â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ version of Fortnite is coming \"soon,\" and an â€ŒiPadâ€Œ version will follow \"this year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe European Commission <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/\">said this morning</a> that iPadOS, the operating system designed to run on the â€ŒiPadâ€Œ, is considered a digital gatekeeper under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). As a result, Apple has six months to comply with the requirements set by the DMA, and we've already seen those requirements implemented on â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Today, the European Commission said that iPads will also need to comply with the Digital Markets Act ðŸ™Œ<br /><br />Weâ€™re moving full steam ahead to bring Fortnite and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EpicGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EpicGames</a> Store to iPhones in the EU soon and iPads this year! ðŸŽ‰ <a href=\"https://t.co/MHh6EGVinC\">https://t.co/MHh6EGVinC</a></p>â€” Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1784978618344456484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nAs of iOS 17.4, â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ users in the European Union can download apps from alternative app marketplaces rather than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, and starting in iOS 17.5, apps are available directly from developer websites. Right now, only â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ apps can be downloaded outside of the â€ŒApp Storeâ€Œ, but Apple will need to expand this functionality to the â€ŒiPadâ€Œ as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWithin six months, EU users will be able to download â€ŒiPadâ€Œ apps from alternative app marketplaces and from websites. As with the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ updates, the upcoming changes are limited to the European Union, and the â€ŒiPadâ€Œ app ecosystem will function as is in the rest of the world.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/fortnite-coming-to-ipad-eu/\">Epic Games to Bring Fortnite to iPad in EU After iPadOS 'Gatekeeper' Decision</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-to-bring-fortnite-to-ipad-in-eu-after-ipados-gatekeeper-decision.2425163/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"121778a252a960faf2053a04843f1d21733e66df7d60c426c78a304a341d7afd","category":"Apple"}
