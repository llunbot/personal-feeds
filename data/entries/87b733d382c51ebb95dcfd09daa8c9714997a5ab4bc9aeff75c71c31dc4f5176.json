Other sources have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apples-2024-ipad-mini-all-the-rumors-so-far/\">claimed</a> new camera upgrades could be included, as well as a potential fix for the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/\">jelly scrolling</a>\" display behavior on the latest model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman previously said that a new entry-level iPad model is similarly unlikely to make an appearance before late 2024 at the earliest. The current low-end iPad was last updated in October 2022.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/ipad-mini-7-not-expected-before-late-2024/\">Next iPad Mini Still Not Expected Before Late 2024 at the Earliest</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-mini-still-not-expected-before-late-2024-at-the-earliest.2426177/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"87b733d382c51ebb95dcfd09daa8c9714997a5ab4bc9aeff75c71c31dc4f5176","category":"Apple"}
