These groups have so far been less active during the current election cycle than they were during previous ones, likely because of a less contested primary season.</p>\n<h2>Stoking divisions</h2>\n<p>Over the past 45 days, the groups have seeded a growing number of social media posts and fake news articles that attempt to foment opposition to US support of Ukraine and stoke divisions over hot-button issues such as election fraud. The influence campaigns also promote questions about President Bidenâ€™s mental health and corrupt judges. In all, Microsoft has tracked scores of such operations in recent weeks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018090#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018090&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa54ed26c6b04c5d0fe5de61f07f2c3be7f886563334ce7806a1abaf0f830081","category":"Tech"}
