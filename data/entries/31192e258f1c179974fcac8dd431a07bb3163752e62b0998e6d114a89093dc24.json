The report adds: \"One current employee said the changes were 'pretty large-scale' and that some roles are being moved abroad.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/17/google-restructures-finance-team-as-a-part-of-ai-shift-cfo-tells-employees-in-memo.html\">CNBC</a> has a copy of the memo that Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat sent out to employees about the layoffs. Porat blames AI for the layoffs, saying, “The tech sector is in the midst of a tremendous platform shift with Al. As a company, this means we have the opportunity to make more helpful products for billions of users and provide faster solutions to our customers, but it also means we collectively have to make tough decisions, including how and where we work to align with our highest priority areas.” It's not clear how or if AI is actually taking over roles in real estate and finance.</p>\n<p>Google has been making cuts across a ton of departments since 2022, when <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/google-ceo-calls-for-a-more-focused-and-efficient-google/\">Pichai declared</a> Google was not productive enough.
