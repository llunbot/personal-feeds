One of Anthropic's smaller models, Haiku, has also been turning heads with its performance on the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>\"For the first time, the best available models—Opus for advanced tasks, Haiku for cost and efficiency—are from a vendor that isn't OpenAI,\" independent AI researcher Simon Willison told Ars Technica. \"That's reassuring—we all benefit from a diversity of top vendors in this space. But GPT-4 is over a year old at this point, and it took that year for anyone else to catch up.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012778#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012778&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"87a86c476a5f4a29b2ae0f8ae8342e84ca63ac4eab6c4ea890b51fb0a6e90536","category":"Tech"}
