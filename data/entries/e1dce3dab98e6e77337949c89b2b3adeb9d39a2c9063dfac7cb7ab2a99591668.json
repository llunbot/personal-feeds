Highlighted by an impressive attack on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/richie-porte-willunga-hill\" target=\"_blank\">Willunga Hill</a>, the Ecuadorian champion improved on his second place at the race last year to stand on the top step of the podium by nine seconds ahead of Movistar’s Javier Romo. Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe’s signing from UAE Finn Fisher-Black finished third, 12 seconds down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The six stages were largely dominated by Fisher-Black’s Australian teammate Sam Welsford, who notched up three sprint wins, making himself a sprinter to watch this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> suffered different fortunes. Juan Pedro López, who began Stage 5 in 54th place overall, was disqualified due to a sticky bottle. The 27-year-old clung onto a bidon from a neutral motorbike for multiple seconds and was understandably booted from the race one day prior to the finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull’s Laurence Pithie was also sanctioned as a result of an irregular sprint on Stage 4, receiving a 500CHF fine and relegation from fourth to seventh on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-2-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wout van Aert to race Cyclocross Worlds</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2191961206.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>Billy Ceusters/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> has confirmed his participation in the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/cyclocross\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclocross</a> World Championships.

Last year’s edition of the race was cancelled due to financial issues and the parent company of the Ladies Tour of Norway AS has also been dissolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, a race spokesperson said, ‘We must acknowledge that we have not succeeded in building a brand that is attractive enough to media, sponsors, and other important stakeholders in Norway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There are no national TV channels in Norway, like NRK and Tv2, who wish to distribute the race on TV despite us covering all production costs.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last edition of the race took place in 2023 and was won by Annemiek van Vleuten. It was the successor to the Ladies Tour of Norway, which ran from 2014 to 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-tour-down-under\">Pro Log: Narváez wins Tour Down Under; Van Aert to ride CX Worlds; 19-year-old Italian pro killed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e1dce3dab98e6e77337949c89b2b3adeb9d39a2c9063dfac7cb7ab2a99591668","category":"Cycling"}
