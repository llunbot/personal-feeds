This includes the exit of Samsung and Apple, two of the world’s most popular smartphone brands. In response, the country has doubled down on its efforts to attain technological self-sufficiency, including creating a new Android smartphone.</p>\n<p>The handset, which does not yet have a name, will be built by the National Computer Corporation (NCC), one of Russia’s largest IT companies, with an ambitious goal to sell 100,000 smartphones and tablets by the end of 2023. Alexander Kalinin, the founder of NCC, <a href=\"https://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2023-02-28_v_rossii_sozdayut_otechestvennye\">told</a> local media on Monday that he aims to invest 10 billion rubles ($132.9 million) in the project and hopes to capture 10 percent of the consumer market by 2026.</p>\n<p>The news comes just days after the US Department of Commerce <a href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/420-part-746-embargoes-and-other-special-controls/file\">banned</a> exports to Russia of phones and other electronics that cost more than $300. Experts say, however, that a Russian smartphone will have a hard time beating inexpensive competitors from China, and it may encounter problems with using Google’s Android.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921838#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94e07683ac7b772f2ccc765d62bea0d4afd8e30bcac1cb00957bb673df7bf5cf","category":"Tech"}
