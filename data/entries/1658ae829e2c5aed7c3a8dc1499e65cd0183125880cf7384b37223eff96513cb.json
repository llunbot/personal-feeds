Previously, the company required that users create an account to use it, even with the free version of ChatGPT that is currently powered by the GPT-3.5 AI language model. But as we have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/\">noted in the past</a>, GPT-3.5 is widely known to provide more inaccurate information compared to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/\">GPT-4 Turbo</a>, available in paid versions of ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<p>Since its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">launch</a> in November 2022, ChatGPT has transformed over time from a tech demo to a comprehensive AI assistant, and it's always had a free version available. The cost is free because \"<a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/\">you're the product</a>,\" as the old saying goes. Using ChatGPT helps OpenAI gather data that will help the company train future AI models, although free users and ChatGPT Plus subscription members can both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/chatgpt-users-can-now-opt-out-of-chat-history-and-model-training/\">opt out</a> of allowing the data they input into ChatGPT to be used for AI training. (OpenAI says it never trains on inputs from <a href=\"https://openai.com/chatgpt/team\">ChatGPT Team</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/the-new-spreadsheet-openai-introduces-chatgpt-enterprise-for-businesses/\">Enterprise</a> members at all).</p>\n<p>Opening ChatGPT to everyone could provide a frictionless on-ramp for people who might use it as a substitute for Google Search or potentially gain new customers by providing an easy way for people to use ChatGPT quickly, then offering an upsell to paid versions of the service.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014076#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014076&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1658ae829e2c5aed7c3a8dc1499e65cd0183125880cf7384b37223eff96513cb","category":"Tech"}
