As such, he claims that the machine is not expected to emerge until late 2024 at the earliest and will not be in the first series of ‌M3‌ Macs to be released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLikewise, new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will not be among the first ‌M3‌ Macs to debut in October later this year. These machines are expected to feature the ‌M3‌ Pro and ‌M3‌ Max chips and will \"probably\" launch by the middle of 2024 at the latest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe also noted that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> ‌Mac mini‌ launched more than two years after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> version was introduced, suggesting that Apple does not see the ‌Mac mini‌ as a device that requires annual refreshes. This is contrasted by the high-end MacBook Pro, a far more popular device, with a refresh cycle of around every four or five quarters.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, Gurman said the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/\">first Macs with an M3 chip could launch as early as October</a> of this year. The first models with the ‌M3‌ chip will likely be the 13-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. The ‌M3‌ chip is widely expected to be fabricated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/3nm-macbook-pro-reportedly-launching-in-2023/\">using TSMC's 3nm process</a> for significant performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the 5nm-based ‌M2‌ chip in existing devices.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/\">Gurman: Refreshed High-End MacBook Pro and Mac Mini With M3 Chips to Launch Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-refreshed-high-end-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-chips-to-launch-next-year.2396657/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fc1da9bfcbaf831d5312ce198a00242f5dd8a21d20e97bd4aa35b84b12dba03","category":"Apple"}
