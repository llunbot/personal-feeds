But what if you want to move something you cannot touch without damaging or disrupting it, like a droplet of liquid? A solution proposed by a team of scientists at the North Carolina State University is a metamaterial that can change shape in response to magnetic fields.</p>\n<p>This material had to be easily deformable to change shape, yet at the same time stiff enough to bear loads. “That seemed contradictory—how do you make something that is stiff and deformable at once?” says Jie Yin, a mechanical metamaterials researcher at NC State. His team did it with ferromagnetic elastomers, kirigami cuts, balloons, and magnets.</p>\n<h2>Refreshable Braille display</h2>\n<p>“There is not much research on using magnets to manipulate non-magnetic objects. It is very, very hard,” says Yinding Chi, another NC State researcher and lead author of the study. The idea Chi and his colleagues came up with could be compared to a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/braille-display-demo-refreshes-with-miniature-fireballs/\">refreshable Braille display</a>. They imagined a surface dotted with domes that could rise, turn, or depress on demand, allowing it to dynamically form relief-like images or move in a pattern similar to waves in the ocean. Objects would then move on these surfaces like they were carried by waves. “This way, you can move various objects without using grippers,” Yin says.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/magnetic-shape-shifting-surface-can-move-stuff-without-grasping-it/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/magnetic-shape-shifting-surface-can-move-stuff-without-grasping-it/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"822617cd228215180a6988f2102ba24653d60c6641d30083590b1ba68355d92a","category":"Tech"}
