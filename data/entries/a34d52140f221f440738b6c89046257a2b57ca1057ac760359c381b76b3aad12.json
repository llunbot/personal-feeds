The image was taken by Bruno Cisterna, with assistance from Eric Vitriol, both with Augusta University in Georgia.</p>\n<p>\"One of the main problems with neurodegenerative diseases is that we don't fully understand what causes them,” Cisterna said in a statement. “To develop effective treatments, we need to figure out the basics first. Our research is crucial for uncovering this knowledge and ultimately finding a cure. Differentiated cells could be used to study how mutations or toxic proteins that cause Alzheimer's or ALS alter neuronal morphology, as well as to screen potential drugs or gene therapies aimed at protecting neurons or restoring their function.”</p>\n<p>It's the 50th anniversary of Nikon's annual contest, which was founded back in 1974 \"to showcase the beauty and complexity of things seen through the light microscope.\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrograph\">Photomicrography</a> involves attaching a camera to a microscope (either an optical microscope or an electron microscope) so that the user can take photographs of objects at very high resolutions. British physiologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hill_Norris\">Richard Hill Norris</a> was one of the first to use it for his studies of blood cells in 1850, and the method has increasingly been highlighted as art since the 1970s. There have been many groundbreaking technological advances in the ensuing decades, particularly with the advent of digital imaging methods.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/photomicrography-contest-winners-showcase-beauty-at-tiny-scales/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/photomicrography-contest-winners-showcase-beauty-at-tiny-scales/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a34d52140f221f440738b6c89046257a2b57ca1057ac760359c381b76b3aad12","category":"Tech"}
