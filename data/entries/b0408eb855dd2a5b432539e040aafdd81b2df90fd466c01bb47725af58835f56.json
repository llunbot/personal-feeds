Through Continuity, your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s widgets can also show up on your Mac's desktop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVideo conferencing has improved with a new Presenter Overlay view that shows your desktop or project in new ways, plus Safari now supports web apps for the Dock and the option to create Profiles so you can separate personal browsing from work browsing. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new features include improved search that's faster and more responsive, password and passkey sharing, a revamped stickers interface for the Messages app, PDF integration in notes that makes it easier than ever to manage PDFs, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nmacOS Sonoma will be in beta testing for several months, with a public release set to come in September or October.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-seeds-macos-14-sonoma-beta-1/\">Apple Releases First Beta of macOS 14 Sonoma to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-beta-of-macos-14-sonoma-to-developers.2391698/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b0408eb855dd2a5b432539e040aafdd81b2df90fd466c01bb47725af58835f56","category":"Apple"}
