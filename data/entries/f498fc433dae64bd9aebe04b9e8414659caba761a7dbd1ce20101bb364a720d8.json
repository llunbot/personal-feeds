This asymmetry is bad for both consumers and competition.\"</p>\n<p>The FCC is \"proposing a uniform 60-day unlocking policy\" so that \"consumers can choose the carrier that offers them the best value,\" Starks said. Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on a different carrier's network as long as the phone is compatible.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038188#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038188&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f498fc433dae64bd9aebe04b9e8414659caba761a7dbd1ce20101bb364a720d8","category":"Tech"}
