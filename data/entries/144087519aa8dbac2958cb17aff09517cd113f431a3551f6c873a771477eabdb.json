Clearly, with a three-time Tour de France stage winner aboard, it’s a bike that can more than mix it with racier rivals, though.</p>\n<p>What’s changed? In short, the head angle is now 1.5 degrees slacker, tyre clearance has increased from 40mm to 45mm, cables now run internally and there are more mounting points.</p>\n<p>The frame, available in carbon fibre and aluminium versions, has had a visual refresh, too, while Merida has specced 180mm rotors on all models for serious braking power.</p>\n<p>Six models make up the range for now. Prices start from £1,275 for the Shimano Sora-equipped Merida Silex 200, and rise to £8,750 for the SRAM Red eTap AXS mullet Merida Silex 10k.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h3>Five things you

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a> capabilities, or aero race credentials, like the new <a

/>\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are two frame options – one made from carbon fibre…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Before we get into features, let’s start with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a>.</p>\n<p>The aluminium-framed Silex Lite weighs a claimed 1,900g, while the carbon fibre Silex CF comes in at a claimed 1,220g. Weights are for a size-medium frame, painted but without any small parts.</p>\n<p>Merida has kept things simple here, with just one carbon frame – unlike some brands that offer different carbon tiers. Both the alloy and carbon frames come with the same 540g (claimed weight) carbon fork.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida Silex aluminium gravel bike\" title=\"Merida Silex aluminium gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> …and one made from aluminium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Visually, the two frames share broadly the same look ­– notably the dropped seatstays. However, the aluminium frame has an external seatpost clamp, and the carbon frame has an internal wedge-style clamp.</p>\n<p>While we’re talking looks, Merida now jokingly describes the old Silex as something of an “ugly duckling” with “challenging looks”.</p>\n<p>The new frames look altogether more modern, and broadly in line with market trends, though the carbon frame in particular still has some distinctive styling around the seatstay junction.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dropped seatstays on Merida Silex gravel bike\" title=\"Dropped seatstays on Merida Silex gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While both bikes have dropped seatstays, the styling is more distinctive on the carbon frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>On that note, when we ran our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-merida-silex/\">original story on Mohorič’s worlds-winning bike</a>, we speculated that the oversized seatstay junction could be designed to improve comfort. However, while the dropped stays and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">27.2mm seatpost</a> may help in that department, the junction itself is largely an aesthetic design choice.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, one notable difference between the two frames is the ability to mount a rack on the aluminium frame. That’s not possible on the carbon frame, but does mark the alloy chassis out as a commuter-cum-gravel bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure>\n<div>\n

That’s with 700c wheels – Merida describes <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b wheels</a> as “obsolete” on gravel bikes.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Maxxis Rambler tyre on Merida Silex gravel bike\" title=\"Maxxis Rambler tyre on Merida Silex gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 700x45c Maxxis Rambler tyres are specced on all bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>The latest endurance road bikes have started to nip at the heels of ‘old-school’ gravel bikes, with the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-roubaix-sl8/\">Specialized Roubaix SL8</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2024-giant-defy/\">new Giant Defy</a> offering 40mm and 38mm of tyre clearance respectively.</p>\n<p>By increasing tyre clearance to 45mm (or 42mm with mudguards/fenders), the Silex marks itself out once again as a dedicated gravel bike (the Scultura Endurance GR is more road-focused with clearance for 35mm). Still, the Silex is still fairly middle-of-the-road as far as today’s gravel bikes are concerned.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Chainstay protector on Merida Silex gravel bike\" title=\"Chainstay protector on Merida Silex gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s a chainstay protector to fend off rock strikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>As an example, the new Canyon Grail tops out at 42mm (a conservative 2mm increase from the original Grail), but that’s apparently a conscious design by Canyon, given that bike’s racy intentions.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum, more ‘progressive’ gravel bikes now offer clearance in the 48-50mm range and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>As for gearing options, 1x and 2x drivetrains continue to duke it out for gravel supremacy, and the new Silex works with both.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a 2x <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">crankset</a>, the frame is compatible with chainrings up to 50-34t (a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-compact-crank/\">compact road crankset</a>, as used by Mohorič at the gravel worlds), so there’s the opportunity to go big with your gravel gearing. The maximum chainring size for 1x is 46 teeth.</p>\n<p>The Silex’s dropped chainstay helps provide the 45mm of tyre clearance, while retaining 1x and 2x compatibility, and this flexibility was important to Merida. “Going 1x reduces weight and gives simplified controls, while a 2x setup delivers short gaps between gears for even cadence,” says Merida. “What works best is up to you.”</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"180mm disc brake rotor on Merida Silex gravel bike\" title=\"180mm disc brake rotor on Merida Silex gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Merida has opted for 180mm brake rotors on all models.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>In terms of braking, all bikes in the range – in all sizes – use 180mm rotors.</p>\n<p>Bigger <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/disc-brake-rotors/\">disc brake rotors</a> were near the top of the wish-list of Hannes Noller, Merida’s senior product manager, who says the weight penalty is negligible compared to the benefit of more braking power.
