But if you’re not the waiting type, you can grab a new Apple Watch Series 8 right now for $310 as Amazon begins clearing out the old models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Amazon’s listing, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDHM49BJ/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">41mm Apple Watch in either midnight or red for $310</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDHZQ6Y6/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">45mm Apple Watch in silver for $340</a>, a savings of $89 and the best price we’ve seen since Prime Day. Other models are also on sale, but these are the deepest discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 8 will be replaced next week by the Apple Watch Series 8, but it’s expected to have many of the same features, including an always-on Retina display, 3rd-gen heart rate, ECG, Blood-oxygen, and temperature sensors, always-on altimeter, and WR50 water resistance. While it’s sure to have other new features, the Series 9’s main upgrade is expected to be a more powerful S9 chip, but we’ve never had a problem with the S8’s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you could wait a week and see if the Series 8 drops further, but there’s no guarantee the model you want will still be available. So if you want one, go grab it now. </p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0abd9e40825d0296d4e4c42734270bd6fcf02cf12e37bd71ffbfa793a2aecc24","category":"Apple"}
