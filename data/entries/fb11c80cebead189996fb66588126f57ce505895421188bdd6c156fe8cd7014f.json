The \"Space Summit\" gathering in Seville, Spain, will encompass several topics, including the future of launch.</p>\n<p>\"Seville will be a very decisive moment for space in Europe,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AschbacherJosef/status/1721120207953871214\">said</a> the director general of the European Space Agency, Josef Aschbacher, on the eve of the summit. \"On launchers, and on exploration, I expect ministers to really make very bold decisions. I certainly expect a paradigm shift on the launcher sector.\"</p>\n<p>Aschbacher has previously described Europe's rocket predicament—the venerable Ariane 5 has retired, its replacement, Ariane 6, is not ready, and the smaller Vega C rocket is also having teething problems—as an acute crisis. Now, it's possible this crisis will lead to the breakup of a decades-long partnership in Europe, led by the nations of France, Germany, and Italy, to collaborate on the development of launch capabilities.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981244#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb11c80cebead189996fb66588126f57ce505895421188bdd6c156fe8cd7014f","category":"Tech"}
