At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1511605/apple-ios-ipados-homepod-tv-safari-16-3-1-watch-9-3-1-macos-13-2-1.html\">Apple patched</a> iPadOS (16.3.1), macOS Ventura (13.2.1), and Safari for Monterey and Big Sur (16.3.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over a month later, Apple has finally updated older iPhones and iPads, too. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213673&amp;xcust=1-1-1674756-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 15.7.4</a>, which is for the iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, and  iPhone SE (1st gen), and iPadOS 15.7.4, for iPad Air 2, iPad mini (4th gen), and iPod touch (7th gen), contains 16 security patches for a variety of system functions, but none are bigger than the WebKit patch from last month:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WebKit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Impact:</strong> Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.
