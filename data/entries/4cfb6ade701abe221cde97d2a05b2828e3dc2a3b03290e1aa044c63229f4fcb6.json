{"title":"Green’s Dictionary of Slang","link":"https://greensdictofslang.com/","date":1712949616000,"content":"\n<p>From its <a href=\"https://greensdictofslang.com/about/\">About page</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Green’s Dictionary of Slang</em> is the largest historical dictionary \nof English slang. Written by Jonathon Green over 17 years from \n1993, it reached the printed page in 2010 in a three-volume set \ncontaining nearly 100,000 entries supported by over 400,000 \ncitations from c. ad 1000 to the present day. The main focus of \nthe dictionary is the coverage of over 500 years of slang from c. \n1500 onwards. </p>\n\n<p>The printed version of the dictionary received the Dartmouth Medal \nfor outstanding works of reference from the American Library \nAssociation in 2012; fellow recipients include the Dictionary of \nAmerican Regional English, the Oxford Dictionary of National \nBiography, and the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. It \nhas been hailed by the American New York Times as ‘the pièce de \nrésistance of English slang studies’ and by the British Sunday \nTimes as ‘a stupendous achievement, in range, meticulous \nscholarship, and not least entertainment value’. </p>\n\n<p>On this website the dictionary is now available in updated online \nform for the first time, complete with advanced search tools \nenabling search by definition and history, and an expanded \nbibliography of slang sources from the early modern period to the \npresent day. Since the print edition, nearly 60,000 quotations \nhave been added, supporting 5,000 new senses in 2,500 new entries \nand sub-entries, of which around half are new slang terms from the \nlast five years. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I forget when I first came across Green’s Dictionary of Slang, but it’s so astonishingly good, in every possible way that it could be good, that I couldn’t believe it wasn’t a household name like Merriam-Webster. The web edition is beautiful, fast, and free of charge. It doesn’t even have ads. It’s amazing.</p>\n\n<p>And now I can’t believe I haven’t recommended it here sooner. Bookmark it, trust me.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/12/greens-dictionary-of-slang\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4cfb6ade701abe221cde97d2a05b2828e3dc2a3b03290e1aa044c63229f4fcb6","category":"Tech"}
