Now you, your friends, and a Processor Drone have to figure out what.<br />\n​<br />\nAnd you'll die—a lot, probably—then try again with new gear and lessons learned, if the title and announcement trailer are anything to go by.</p>\n<p></p><div><div></div><p>Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core announcement trailer. </p></div><br />\n​<br />\nYou can wishlist <em>Rogue Core</em> on Steam now, and the game will launch in Early Access, which is anticipated to last for 18–24 months, in November 2024. Closed alpha tests will be announced on the game’s Steam page and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/drg\">fan Discord</a>. <em>Deep Rock</em>’s developer, Ghost Ship Games, <a href=\"https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/swipe-right/pressreleases/ghost-ship-games-reveals-new-game-deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-launching-in-november-2024-3277968\">promises</a> “updates on the game’s direction right from the very earliest stage of development” and will be “adding new features to the game based on feedback and observations of how our community is playing it. Each feature will be tweaked, balanced, and polished as it is added.”<br />\n​<br />\nMikkel Martin Pedersen, co-founder and game director at Ghost Ship Games, said in a press release that the company intends to keep fans in the loop, as “our process of open development helped <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> be the game it has become.” The developer also emphasized that support for the original game will continue.<br />\n​<br />\nThe game’s teaser trailer provides only a minimum of context for the plot. It’s heavy on the Ridley Scott <em>Alien</em> touches, right down to a Lego brick of a ship coasting toward a planet where the corporation has lost contact with workers who were mining near the planet’s core. Your “Reclaimers” team has to reestablish the dig. That's about all we know for now.\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DRG_RC_Screenshot_04-980x551.png\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            A dusty (or snowy?) piece of the abandoned core mine on Hoxxes IV. Your job is to keep moving through it.

Given the roguelite framing, you can expect some upgrades to stick with you from session to session. But <em>R</em><em>ogue</em> may differ significantly from the far more casual, dig-by-dig nature of its foundation, if the claustrophobic, abandoned-station screenshots and trailer are any clue.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973529#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973529&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"329860233ff441b12fed168450f3bd95c18c4e7e92525c8a46847d78799aefed","category":"Tech"}
