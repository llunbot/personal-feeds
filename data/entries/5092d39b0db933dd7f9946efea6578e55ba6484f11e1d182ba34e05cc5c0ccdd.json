{"title":"Arc 1.0","link":"https://arc.net/","date":1691014298000,"content":"\n<p>Upstart web browser Arc, which remains exclusive to the Mac <a href=\"https://arc.net/\">for now</a>, is out of beta. I find Arc hard to explain in a nutshell, and personally, it’s not for me. But I’ve got some friends who really dig it, and I can see why. It’s a rethinking of how a web browser should look and work. It’s less like a traditional browser and more like a virtual environment/platform unto itself, where tabs are more like apps inside a parent Arc window.</p>\n\n<p>The reason it doesn’t resonate with me is that I’m both deeply accustomed to <em>and really like</em> Safari. But if you find yourself dissatisfied with Safari and other traditional browsers like Chrome, you should definitely give Arc a look. It’s clever and ambitious. I even love the name of the company: <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company/\">The Browser Company of New York</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/arc\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5092d39b0db933dd7f9946efea6578e55ba6484f11e1d182ba34e05cc5c0ccdd","category":"Tech"}
