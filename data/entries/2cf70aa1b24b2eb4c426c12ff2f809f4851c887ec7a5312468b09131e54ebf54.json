But this year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-review-still-the-best-smartwatch-but-tracking-is-lacking/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Series 6</a> owners can breathe a sigh of relief, as the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/mgjVA7\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> is essentially the same device with a (largely imperceptible) facelift.</p>\n<p>2021 won’t be the year we see an Apple Watch that can measure blood pressure (no major smartwatch can do so, for that matter), but it is the year we finally get an Apple Watch that charges fully in just over an hour. And that means a 10- or 30-minute dash on the charger goes much further now. Apple also introduced IPX6 dust resistance to the Watch for the first time, along with three new colors.</p>\n<p>Oh, and there’s a full QWERTY keyboard option for text input.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812307#p3\">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812307&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2cf70aa1b24b2eb4c426c12ff2f809f4851c887ec7a5312468b09131e54ebf54","category":"Tech"}
