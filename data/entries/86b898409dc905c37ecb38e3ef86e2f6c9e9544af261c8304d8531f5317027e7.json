However, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/08/intel-thunderbolt-4-details/\">TB4 offers more power and utility and is backwards compatible</a>, it doesn't deliver any bandwidth increase over the maximum 40 Gb/s of Thunderbolt 3, so the step up to Thunderbolt 5 with its doubled maximum throughput could be significant. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe practical upshot of these innovations could mean, for example, TB5 supporting higher refresh rates for 4K and 8K monitors while providing backward compatibility with older Thunderbolt and USB connections. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhether Intel Thunderbolt 5 will be officially launched – and supported by future Apple devices – is unclear at this time, but the unintentional leak at least provides a peak into where Intel might take the interface protocol in the future.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt-3/\">Thunderbolt 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt-5/\">Thunderbolt 5</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/02/thunderbolt-5-80gbs-bandwidth-intel-leak/\">Thunderbolt 5 Could Offer Up to 80 Gbps Bandwidth, Intel Leak Suggests</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/thunderbolt-5-could-offer-up-to-80-gbps-bandwidth-intel-leak-suggests.2306248/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5JG56zIERU0:zrP8v3B7tfs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5JG56zIERU0:zrP8v3B7tfs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5JG56zIERU0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"86b898409dc905c37ecb38e3ef86e2f6c9e9544af261c8304d8531f5317027e7","category":"Apple"}
