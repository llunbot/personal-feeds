{"title":"‘The Apple Jonathan: A Very 1980s Concept Computer That Never Shipped’","link":"https://512pixels.net/2024/03/apple-jonathan-modular-concept/","date":1713823789000,"content":"\n<p>Stephen Hackett, writing at 512 Pixels:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The backbone of the system would need to accept modules from Apple \nand other companies, letting users build what they needed in terms \nof functionality, as D’Agostino writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Fitch) designed a simple hardware “backbone” carrying basic \noperations and I/O on which the user could add a series of “book” \nmodules, carrying hardware for running Apple II, Mac, UNIX and \nDOS software, plus other modules with disk drives or networking \ncapabilities. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This meant that every user could have their own unique Jonathan \nsetup, pulling together various software platforms, storage \ndevices, and hardware capabilities into their own personalized \nsystem. Imagining what would have been required for all this to \nwork together gives me a headache. In addition to the shared \nbackbone interface, there would need to be software written to \nmake an almost-endless number of configurations work smoothly for \nthe most demanding of users. It was all very ambitions, but \nperhaps a little too far-fetched. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d go further than “never shipped” and describe this is a concept that never <em>could</em> have shipped. It was a pipe dream. The concepts sure did look cool though.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/22/apple-jonathan\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"119fd79d41dd2cbbe7ef9a8801ec63c299b3af4191acdead4a4bbfd362d86ba9","category":"Tech"}
