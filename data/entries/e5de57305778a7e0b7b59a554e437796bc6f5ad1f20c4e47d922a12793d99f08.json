Scientists at the University of California, San Diego, think they have found the answer: outflowing galactic winds from exploding stars in so-called \"starburst\" galaxies. They described their findings in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06752-8\">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature.</p>\n<p>“These galaxies are really interesting,” <a href=\"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/space-oddity\">said Alison Coil</a> of the University of California, San Diego. “They occur when two big galaxies collide. The merger pushes all the gas into a very small region, which causes an intense burst of star formation. Massive stars burn out quickly, and when they die, they expel their gas as outflowing winds.”</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/we-have-our-best-look-yet-at-mysterious-orcs-odd-radio-circles-in-space/\">reported previously</a>, the discovery arose from the <a href=\"http://emu-survey.org\">Evolutionary Map of the Universe</a> (EMU) project, which aims <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_Map_of_the_Universe\">to take</a> a census of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source\">radio sources</a> in the sky. Several years ago, Ray Norris, an astronomer at Western Sydney University and <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/astronomy-space\">CSIRO</a> in Australia, predicted the EMU project would make unexpected discoveries. He dubbed them \"WTFs.\" <a href=\"https://www.akapinska.com\">Anna Kapinska</a>, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) was browsing through radio astronomy data collected by CSIRO's Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope when she noticed several strange shapes that didn't seem to resemble any known type of object. Following Norris' nomenclature, she labeled them as possible WTFs. One of those was a picture of a ghostly circle of radio emission, \"hanging out in space like a cosmic smoke ring.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994856#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994856&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e5de57305778a7e0b7b59a554e437796bc6f5ad1f20c4e47d922a12793d99f08","category":"Tech"}
