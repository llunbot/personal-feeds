Now that iOS 18.3.2 is not being signed, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.4 are not able to downgrade to a version of iOS 18.3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.3.2-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIt is typical for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS after releasing an update, and the process keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS. \"Signing\" refers to a server-side verification check that's done when versions of iOS are downloaded onto an ‌iPhone‌. Only software that passes the verification check is able to be installed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPreventing downgrading ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks or security holes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iOS 18.4 update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/ios-18-4-security-fixes/\">fixed more than 60 vulnerabilities</a>, so it is a good idea to install the software if you have not done so already.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-3-2/\">Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.3.2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-3-2.2454907/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce6418cf95ee3248d2f60a93950730a5d93ff48c00fa7a3733bba49d209a9aae","category":"Apple"}
