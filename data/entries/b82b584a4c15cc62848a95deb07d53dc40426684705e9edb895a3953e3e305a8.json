One clip shows Jobs explaining what essentially is early work done with AI. “The human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately,” said Jobs, “And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an introduction written by Jony Ive, the online exhibit also features video clips of Jobs talking about design simplicity, the future of personal computers, how computers can augment human abilities, and more.
