Vision Pro is \"the first Apple Product you look through, not at,\" Apple's Tim Cook said, a \"new AR platform with a new product\" that \"augments reality by seamlessly blending the real world with the digital world.\"</p>\n<p>\"I believe augmented reality is a profound technology. Blending digital content with the real world can unlock new experiences,\" Cook said.</p>\n<p>The headset, which looks like a pair of shiny ski goggles, has a lightweight aluminum frame with a single piece of glass on the front that acts as a lens for a wide array of cameras. A single button lets you capture videos while a \"digital crown\" lets you tune how much of outside reality is filtered out at any time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943749#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943749&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ee61fcd2b6d12555e8c8be048e336f3eb074514d0ed56be854689bec0e9fdef","category":"Tech"}
