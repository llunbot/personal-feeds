We went straight from the Tour de France to the Olympics and now we’re going straight from the Olympics into the Tour de France Femmes (and then the men’s Vuelta will come straight after that). What a time to be alive. To make it even better, we’re going to tell you exactly what will happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us know in the comments or on social media if you think we are stupid and who your picks are.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Robyn Davidson, editorial assistant</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-970x594.jpg\" alt=\"tour de france femmes jersey wearers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-970x594.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-300x184.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-768x471.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-1536x941.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-2048x1255.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-750x460.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/2023-tdff-podium-A.S.O.-Charly-Lopez-1140x699.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Robyn had a tough run with her men’s Tour predictions, despite only ever picking favourites, she’ll be hoping to bounce back this time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yellow jersey: Demi Vollering (SD Worx-Protime)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to see past the defending champion. Like last year, she’ll have a quieter start to the race (hopefully with no drafting penalty this time) and assert her dominance in the final two stages in the mountains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 7 atop Le Grand-Bornand will force GC gaps but it’s Stage 8 where she’ll really make her mark, presumably already donning the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-celebration-of-the-yellow-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">maillot jaune</a></em>, dropping all her fellow competitors for stage honours with another Tour de France Femmes victory in the bag – her last for SD Worx-Protime before she moves next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green jersey: Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grand Départ in the Netherlands is pan flat. Perfect for home rider Lorena Wiebes. The team are going for the yellow jersey later on but will be fully focussed on Wiebes in the early stages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has been flying this season with victories galore from the UAE Tour to Vuelta a Burgos to the Tour of Britain Women to the Baloise Ladies Tour to… you get the point. She grabbed a hattrick of victories at the Ford RideLondon Classique, winning every stage. Sure, resources will be directed towards Vollering but with the power and dominance Wiebes has been riding with this year, that shouldn’t hinder her too much anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot jersey: Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You could easily put Demi Vollering here. But I’m going to wear my heart on my sleeve and say Kasia Niewiadoma will go back-to-back in mountains classifications at the Tour de France Femmes. The Canyon-SRAM rider, who finished eighth at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/womens-olympic-road-race-paris-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic Games road race</a>, recently topped the mountains classification standings at the Thüringen Ladies Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niewiadoma is looking for overall victory, but if she can’t grab the yellow jersey, she might just see the polka dots once more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>White jersey: Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ewan jumped in with a frustratingly strong shout (see below) before I made my picks, so erring on the side of caution at duplicating our predictions, I’ll go for another big candidate in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/shirin-van-anrooij-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Shirin van Anrooij</a>. Just last year, she won the Tour de l’Avenir and the youngster not only has a bright future but also a bright present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now 22 years old, she has been sweeping up youth classifications this season, from the Setmana Ciclista Valenciana to the Vuelta a Burgos and the Thüringen Ladies Tour. I predict she’ll replicate her fortune from the 2022 Tour de France Femmes and win the white jersey by three minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Juliette Labous to podium</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Juliette Labous (dsm-firmenich PostNL) has been <em>so</em> close to getting a podium in all three Grand Tours. In 2022 she came fourth in the Tour de France Femmes. In 2023, she shot to second place at the Giro d’Italia and finished fifth at the Tour de France Femmes. This year, she placed fourth at La Vuelta Femenina and fifth at the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A podium place is calling out her name. I’m locked in on Labous.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ewan Wilson, staff writer</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-970x646.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Lorena-Wiebes-wins-in-Drenthe-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>SD Worx-Protime</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brave soul stuck by Jonas Vingegaard for this year’s Tour de France. You can only chapeau, but he’s making up for it by going pure favourites this time around so put your <em>chapeau</em> straight back on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yellow: Demi Vollering</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year, Demi Vollering has confirmed that she is the best Grand Tour rider in the women’s peloton. Her performance at the Vuelta a couple of months ago solidified this status. Another win at the Tour de France Femmes feels all too inevitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite her rumoured exit from the Dutch super-squad, I believe Vollering will rally her troops one final time and seal the deal atop <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alpe-d-huez-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Alpe d’Huez</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green: Lorena Wiebes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lorena Wiebes is enjoying her best season to date. In total, she’s taken 17 race wins so far in 2024 and I suspect that will increase at the Tour. Fresh from an <em>almost </em>clean sweep at the recent Tour of Belgium, Wiebes is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The early flat stages in the Netherlands suit her strengths. If all goes to plan, she should start the race in yellow and swap that out for green along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot: Demi Vollering</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 75% of the total KOM points will be contested in the final two stages. In particular, over half of the points on offer in that classification will be awarded during the final stage to Alpe d’Huez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, I believe it’ll be hard for a breakaway rider to win the classification. If the race is controlled tightly on Stage 8, then the balance of polka dot power swings into the hands of the GC riders. Therefore, I have to stand by this belief and choose my overall winner Demi Vollering. Boring, I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>White: Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bradbury has podiumed four UCI WorldTour races this year, including a recent GC podium at the Giro d’Italia Women. A stage win at the Giro and the Tour de Suisse underlines the Australian’s strength in the mountains. With this form, I am fully prepared for another strong performance at the Tour, especially on Stages 7 and 8.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus: Grace Brown wins a stage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not being very risky with this, I am aware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FDJ-Suez’s Grace Brown is the newly crowned Olympic time-trial champion and she’s the current holder of the Liège-Bastogne-Liège title. Stages 3 and 4 should suit her to a T in that case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her final Tour de France, it feels right that Brown gets a fairytale send-off. It worked for Mark Cavendish at the men’s Tour, so why not hope that lightning strikes twice at the Tour de France Femmes? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we might even get it on a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ranking-olympic-gold-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">gold bike</a> for the short time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pete Muir, editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/03040826/cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_2-02109-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_2-02109\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He finally broke his predictions curse by predicting that he’d get a prediction right, so beware of black magic here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yellow: Demi Vollering</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll all be decided in the mountains in the last couple of stages, and it’s hard to envision any other finish than Vollering, resplendent in yellow, crossing the line at Alpe d’Huez, arms aloft, to take her second Tour victory in two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green: Marianne Vos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The GOAT just keeps on going and keeps on winning. She may not be able to challenge Vollering in the mountains but she will be in the mix at all the sprints and will be able to scoop up points in the hilly stages. May she keep goating for many years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot: Demi Vollering</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When predicting the Queen of the Mountains there are only two ways to go about it. One is to put on a blindfold and throw a dart at a list of names of all competitors; the other is to accept that the majority of mountain points will come on those final two stages, so it’s pretty likely that the winner of the yellow jersey will also take home the polka dots. Hence Vollering. Dull but inevitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>White: Shirin van Anrooij</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How does a flat country like the Netherlands produce so many talented climbers? Who knows? But Van Anrooij is the latest in a long line of Dutch women who excel in cyclocross and Classics, but can also be at the pointy end in the mountains stages. A future Tour winner in the making.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other: Lizzie Deignan to win a stage and then announce her retirement </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two predictions in one! Dangerous stuff. At 35, Deignan is still a force to be reckoned with (as demonstrated by an impressive Olympic showing) but not likely to trouble the GC, so she’ll remind everyone of what she can do with a breakaway win on Stage 6 (three predictions!), and then announce that she’s calling it a day at the end of her contract in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Martin James, production editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist in orange and purple rides up mountain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/20230729TDFFAZ0055-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only one to successfully predict Cédrine Kerbaol’s white jersey win in 2023 is back and ready to hit again.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yellow jersey: Demi Vollering </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Defending champion? Check. Rides for the strongest team? Check. Race starts in her home country? Check. The nature of the Tour de France Femmes route might keep the GC relatively tight before the double whammy of summit finishes on the final weekend, but it’s hard to see anyone getting the better of Demi Vollering once the battle for GC honours finally takes centre stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green jersey: Lorena Wiebes </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the absence of teammate Lotte Kopecky, this feels like another fairly nailed on prediction. With the full SD Worx train behind her, Lorena Wiebes has every chance of going two-for-two on home soil on the opening weekend, at which point the biggest remaining challenge would be actually finishing the race given she failed to do so in 2022 and 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot jersey: Kasia Niewiadoma </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As pointed out by Ewan, so many points are being dished out on the final two stages that it’ll actually be hard for the overall winner not to also pick up this jersey by default. But if Demi Vollering is already in yellow going into the final day, that could leave room for Kasia Niewiadoma to edge her out in a thrilling finale on Alpe d’Huez and nab the climbing prize for herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>White: Neve Bradbury</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Look throughout these predictions and it’s painfully obvious that a small number of established names seem to exist on a separate playing field to the rest of the women’s peloton. Bradbury is very much the exception, however. The 22-year-old Australian had achieved practically nothing of note before this season, yet she comes into the Tour de France having won a stage and the youth classification in both of her last two races – the Giro d’Italia and Tour de Suisse. Even if she doesn’t grab a stage win, the young rider’s jersey – and possibly even a podium place on GC – are very much on the cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus: Kasia Niewiadoma to win on Alpe d’Huez</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering Kasia Niewiadoma has been among the top riders in the women’s peloton for the best part of a decade now, actual wins have proven frustratingly elusive. It’s been no different in the Tour de France: in 16 stages of the race to date, she’s had nine top-ten finishes but zero victories. So what better place to break the trend and get her first TdFF stage win than on the hallowed slopes of Alpe d’Huez?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will Strickson, website editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"neve bradbury lifts her arm as she wins giro stage\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-neve-bradbury-giro-24-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Marco Zac/NurPhoto via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried not to pick the favourites, it wasn’t easy but stay with me there’s logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yellow: Kasia Niewiadoma, Canyon-SRAM</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time. Kasia Niewiadoma has been getting better as the Tour de France Femmes grows, and this year should suit her skillset even more than last year when she missed out on second place despite finishing on the same time as Lotte Kopecky. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going into the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-du-tourmalet-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Tourmalet</a> stage last year Niewiadoma was actually ahead of Vollering by 12 seconds, but then lost time on that big mountain day and in the time-trial. With just a prologue-worthy TT this time it’ll come down to whether she can stick around on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-de-france-femmes-climbs\" target=\"_blank\">Le Grand Bornand</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s not even the final day? I hear you cry. Well, I think Niewiadoma will go into that stage in yellow after a big solo win on the Ardennes stage that takes in climbs from Amstel Gold Race and Liège-Bastogne-Liège. She’ll then lose <em>some </em>time to Vollering on that penultimate stage to Le Grand Bornand and then she’ll repeat last year on the final stage by attacking over the top of the Col du Glandon, going clear on the descent and holding on all the way up Alpe d’Huez – which is not as hard as the Tourmalet – to a very popular victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green: Charlotte Kool, DSM-Firmenich-PostNL</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s going to be a nightmare Tour for SD Worx. Not only will Vollering not win on her farewell, Lorena Wiebes will fumble the home sprints, losing out to compatriot and former leadout Charlotte Kool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Kool has not had great form this year, only winning once and losing to Wiebes a lot, however she’s peaking for the Tour, I’ve got a feeling. She also has a solid leadout including Rachele Barbieri and Pfeiffer Georgi to get her to the right place and the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot: Kasia Niewiadoma, Canyon-SRAM</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To win yellow she’ll need to win polka dots, there’ll be points in the Ardennes, a few points at Le Grand Bornand but they’ll mostly come on that final day – though it won’t be maximum points, more on that below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>White: Neve Bradbury, Canyon-SRAM</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What Ewan said. The former Zwift Academy winner has had a breakout year and has been mightily impressive. She’s been the best young rider at the UAE Tour, Tour de Suisse and Giro d’Italia, and this will be her biggest notch yet as she helps her teammate Niewiadoma to yellow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus: breakaway win on Alpe d’Huez</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the drama, Mick. Breakaways haven’t had loads of success at the Tour de France Femmes, especially not on the mountain stages, which have been dominated. This year, there will be a clever rider losing time deliberately to be allowed to get away, but they’ll have to be a good enough climber to stay away on Alpe d’Huez.
