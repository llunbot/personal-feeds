The US government relies on SpaceX for a lot of missions. These include launching national security satellites, putting astronauts on the Moon, and global broadband communications. But there are hurdles<span>—technical and, increasingly, political</span><span>—on the road ahead. To put it generously, </span>Elon Musk, without whom much of what SpaceX does wouldn't be possible, is one of the most divisive figures in American life today.</p>\n<p>Now, a Democratic lawmaker in Congress has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5128492-house-dem-proposes-bill-named-after-musk-ending-federal-contracts-for-special-government-employees/\">introduced a bill</a> that would end federal contracts for special government employees (like Musk), citing conflict-of-interest concerns. The bill will go nowhere with Republicans in control of Congress, but it is enough to make me pause and think. When the Trump era passes and a new administration takes the White House, how will they view Musk? Will there be an appetite to reduce the government's reliance on SpaceX? To answer this question, you must first ask if the government will even have a choice. What if, as is the case in many areas today, there's no viable replacement for the services offered by SpaceX?</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.
