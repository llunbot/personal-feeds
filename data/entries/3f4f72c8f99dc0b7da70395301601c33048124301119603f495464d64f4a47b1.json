But <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/caffeine-connection-between-coffee-and-headaches\">caffeine can cause headaches and jitters</a> in others. That’s why many people reach for a decaffeinated cup instead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/michael-crowder.html\">I’m a chemistry professor</a> who has taught lectures on why chemicals dissolve in some liquids but not in others. The processes of decaffeination offer great real-life examples of these chemistry concepts. Even the best decaffeination method, however, <a href=\"https://www.ncausa.org/Decaffeinated-Coffee\">does not remove all of the caffeine</a>—about 7 milligrams of caffeine usually remain in an 8-ounce cup.</p>\n<p>Producers decaffeinating their coffee want to remove the caffeine while retaining all—or at least most—of the other chemical aroma and flavor compounds. Decaffeination <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee\">has a rich history</a>, and now almost all coffee producers use <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/\">one of three common methods</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039127#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039127&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3f4f72c8f99dc0b7da70395301601c33048124301119603f495464d64f4a47b1","category":"Tech"}
