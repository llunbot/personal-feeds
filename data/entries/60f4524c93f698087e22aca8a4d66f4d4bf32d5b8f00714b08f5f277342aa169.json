Then, you'll have access to a diagnostic suite, including things like a mobile resource inspector for checking software and validating components' presence, testing for audio output and \"display pixel anomalies,\" and tests for cameras and Face ID.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990929#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990929&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60f4524c93f698087e22aca8a4d66f4d4bf32d5b8f00714b08f5f277342aa169","category":"Tech"}
