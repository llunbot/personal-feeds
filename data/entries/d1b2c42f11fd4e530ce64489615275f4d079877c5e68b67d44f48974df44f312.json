The MagTag Ultra Slim Tracker Card offers a sleek solution. It’s just 1.5mm thick, looks like a credit card, and still connects to Apple’s Find My network<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2505&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-works-with-apple-find-my-app-25-05-19&amp;utm_term=SALE-327501\" target=\"_blank\"> just like an AirTag</a>. Best part? It’s on sale now for $23.99 (MSRP $59.99), no coupon required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Subtle, slim, and hard to lose</h2>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s your wallet, passport case, laptop sleeve, or even your kid’s backpack, MagTag is designed to disappear into your everyday essentials. The ultra-thin design makes it nearly invisible, and a built-in keyring hole lets you clip it to a lanyard or keychain if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MagTag supports “Left Behind” alerts through the Apple Find My app, so you’ll get a notification if you walk away without your wallet or bag. You can also see its last known location on a map—or make it beep from your iPhone when it’s hiding nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As tough as it is tiny, this tracker is also waterproof, dustproof, and built to last. The rechargeable battery only needs topping off once every five months, making it one of the more low-maintenance options out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re looking for a better travel tracker or just tired of misplacing your wallet, MagTag makes a strong case for being the smarter alternative to an AirTag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get the <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2505&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-works-with-apple-find-my-app-25-05-19&amp;utm_term=SALE-327501\" target=\"_blank\">MagTag Ultra Slim Tracker Card </a>for just $23.99, now!</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp2.stackassets.com/d4ae964c5f6c24fd2884d377c9419a7db1ab3937/store/bba54c79cfcc980df622114edb3c9b8149e0525bce8c9f709c99fd8d0668/sale_327501_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>MagTag Ultra Slim Tracker Card – Works with Apple Find My App<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2505&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-works-with-apple-find-my-app-2025-05-28&amp;utm_term=SALE-327501\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/?utm_content=PS-2505&amp;utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=Referral\"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d1b2c42f11fd4e530ce64489615275f4d079877c5e68b67d44f48974df44f312","category":"Apple"}
