Chase them around to up the effort, race them through a course, or just watch them ride along for kick and giggles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each bot has its own unique skill, here’s how MyWhoosh describes them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sprinter:</strong> The Sprinter bot is your go-to for high-intensity, short-distance bursts. Ideal for final sprints or quick breakaways.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mountain:</strong> The Mountain Bot thrives on steep climbs, offering sustained power and endurance where it matters most.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flat:</strong> The Flat Bot excels in maintaining top speeds on flat terrains, perfect for long stretches without significant elevation changes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attacker:</strong> The Attacker Bot specializes in making decisive, strategic moves that can change the course of the race in an instant.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Smasher:</strong> With the Smasher Bot, harness raw power to dominate the peloton and create significant gaps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Climber:</strong> The Climber bot brings grace and efficiency to challenging ascents, helping you conquer hills with ease.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can select specific one or more bots, adjust their power, change their refueling strategy, and then insert them into workouts for pacing, sprinting, climbing, lead-outs, and more. Here’s the complete guide to using them:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, there’s more…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Power Passport Test Protocol update</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1108\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update.jpg\" alt=\"MyWhoosh power protocol screenshot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update-297x183.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update-800x492.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update-120x74.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update-768x473.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-power-passport-report-update-1536x945.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MyWhoosh’s updated Power Passport Test now focuses primarily on capturing an accurate FTP (Functional Threshold Power) to use for race performance verification. The key update involves the removal of the 30-second interval from the test protocol to provide users with more recovery time between the 3-minute and 12-minute maximal effort intervals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lapping System, Climbing Map, Monthly Training Calendar &amp; more</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1113\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer.jpg\" alt=\"MyWhoosh lap timer feature shown on screen\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer-297x184.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer-800x495.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer-120x74.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer-768x475.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-laps-timer-1536x950.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A visible lap tracker now appears in freeride mode, plus changes to the leaderboard and a new HUD update.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1097\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view.jpg\" alt=\"MyWhoosh monthly training calendar screenshot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view-297x181.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view-800x488.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view-120x73.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view-768x468.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-month-long-calender-training-view-1536x936.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a new monthly view of your training calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1120\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance.jpg\" alt=\"MyWhoosh screenshot for endurance climb map\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance-297x185.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance-800x498.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance-768x478.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mywhoosh-climbing-endurance-1536x956.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And a new Endurance Climb Route should give you somewhere to see what those bots are made of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, there’s now increased compatibility for low-end Android devices with at least 3GB of memory.
