But I struggle to think of a better term for something like <a href=\"https://lenovo.vzew.net/c/1305166/218864/3808?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx1%2Fx1-extreme-g4%2F22tp2x1x1e4&amp;subid1=ArsThinkPadX1Extreme4\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Extreme</a>, currently in its 4th generation.</p>\n<p>Where other workstation-y laptops like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/dell-xps-15-9510-review-a-gorgeous-well-balanced-workstation-laptop/\" target=\"_blank\">Dell’s XPS 15</a> have dropped ports and offer only limited GPU options in an effort to slim down and become more mobile, the X1 Extreme still comes with a healthy selection of ports (both in number and variety) and offers GPUs all the way up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080. Its 16-inch screen is also subtly but noticeably larger than the 15.6-inch panels you’ll find in other laptops with similar speeds and weights.</p>\n<p>(If you’re buying an X1 Extreme Gen 4, you could also check out the <a href=\"https://lenovo.vzew.net/c/1305166/218864/3808?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadp%2Fthinkpad-p1-gen-4%2Fwmd00000463&amp;subid1=ArsThinkPadX1Extreme4\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo P1 Gen 4</a>, which is a workstation-branded version of an essentially identical laptop with Nvidia A- and T-series workstation GPUs in most models rather than RTX-series consumer GPUs. If you can get a P1 for cheaper than a comparable X1 Extreme, it’s a safe trade to make.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819701#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819701&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"875ddd69d8ebee998ea9269e9a10895d869e35831fa16b15a3f4742bc2bc51c2","category":"Tech"}
