That never happened, but Apple is introducing a similar location function for the ‌Siri‌ Remote in tvOS 17.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/siri-remote-location.jpg\" alt width=\"2113\" height=\"1189\" />\r<br />\nIf the ‌Siri‌ Remote becomes lost, tvOS 17 users can open up the ‌Apple TV‌ remote on the Control Center on a linked <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to locate their ‌Siri‌ Remote. There is a Find My-like interface that will guide them toward the remote, with the size of the onscreen circle growing to guide movement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature for locating a ‌Siri‌ Remote works with the second-generation or later version of the device, and tvOS 17 is required as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Remote location feature is likely possible due to deeper integration between the ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and the ‌Apple TV‌. Apple has also introduced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> app for the ‌Apple TV‌ that uses a connected ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ as the camera source.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new tvOS 17 features include updated screen savers that use your photos, an option to immediately switch to your profile when you use the ‌Apple TV‌ with your ‌iPhone‌ remote, and a revamped Control Center that makes it easier for you to access key settings and information.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/tvos-17-find-lost-remote/\">tvOS 17 Lets You Use Your iPhone to Find a Lost Siri Remote</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-17-lets-you-use-your-iphone-to-find-a-lost-siri-remote.2391704/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2042e5bc785d9fb83dd76473350f22ffcfd388c4cf7c4f0487d8a4189dce3f5f","category":"Apple"}
