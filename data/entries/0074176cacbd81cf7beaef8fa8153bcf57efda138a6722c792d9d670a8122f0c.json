It allows URLs to link directly to any visible text on a page. You may have seen it work in Google Search, where clicking on a link in your returned results takes you to a highlighted passage of text further down the page.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince then, Google has built the feature into the open source Chromium code, so most other popular Chromium browsers like Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi also have it these days. (Brave is an exception, citing <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/76\">some privacy risks</a> of STTF.)\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Copy Link With Highlight in Safari</h2>\r<br />\nLate last year, Apple joined the club, and brought full support to Safari 18.2. To use the feature, visit a web page and simply highlight the text you want to create a link to, then right-click and choose <strong>Copy Link with Highlight</strong> from the dropdown menu.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/copy-link-with-highlight1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2276\" height=\"728\" /><div><em>The \"Copy Link to Highlight\" option</em></div>\r<br />\nThis will generate a special URL that includes a hash (#) symbol and \"text\" element, followed by a few words that bookend the selected text. All you need to do is share the link with someone, and when they click it they'll be sent directly to that part of the webpage with the specific passage highlighted, as shown below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/copy-link-with-highlight2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2034\" height=\"712\" /><div><em>The shared link as the recipient sees it</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat's all there is to it. The Copy Link to Highlight option is also available in Safari on the iPhone and iPad, and indeed in any browser that uses WebKit on iOS and iPadOS. Hopefully that makes it easier for you to direct the recipient of the link to the content you actually want them to focus on. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBear in mind that the look of highlighted text can differ depending on whether the page author has styled it to look a certain way. Also, text fragment linking does not work in PDFs.
