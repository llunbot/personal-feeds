But perhaps nothing is stranger than a pair of Omega Sports sneakers adorned with the Apple logo—and you can now own a pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sotheby’s Auction House is selling the sneakers as an immediate purchase for $50,000 outright and describes them as “one of the most obscure in existence and highly coveted on the resale market.” While Apple had a brief line of clothing in the mid-80s, these shoes were never sold to customers but were rather a “one-time giveaway at a National Sales Conference,” according to Sotheby’s. It’s not clear how many shoes were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoes themselves are somewhat unremarkable, with an all-white design adorned with an rainbow Apple logo on the tongue and sides. Sotheby’s says the shoes are new in box but the condition “is consistent with age, imperfections include yellowing around the midsoles and glue, and light marks on the toe boxes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The description says more than 22,000 Apple consumers purchased clothing and accessories from the brand in 1985 before the line was retired. Apple still sells a selection of shirts and accessories at its Apple Park campus for visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shipping is free but the buyer will need to pay local sales tax on the purchase.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b2200d2c2fda5541d89914ce65ad6ce4eb0fa8840b38f6c605da1b260158387b","category":"Apple"}
