Affected customers say the iPhone goes into a data recovery mode with a white screen, and the NFC chip is no longer functional after the device reboots.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an iPhone, the NFC chip powers features like Apple Pay and digital car keys. Affected users receive a \"Could Not Set Up Apple Pay\" error message in the Wallet app, and there does not appear to be a way to fix the problem. Some customers say Apple replaced their iPhone after confirming the NFC chip failed, but the replacement iPhone is then vulnerable to the same issue, so there is currently no permanent solution.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Error.jpg\" alt width=\"1179\" height=\"658\" />\r<br />\nWhile complaints so far have come from iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max users, it is possible the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are also affected, so owners of any iPhone 15 model should proceed with caution until this issue is sorted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear what the specific cause of the issue is, how many customers are affected, and which BMW models are affected. We've reached out to an Apple spokesperson for comment, and we'll update this story if we receive a response.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bmw/\">BMW</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/\">Warning: BMW Wireless Charging May Break iPhone 15's Apple Pay Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-bmw-wireless-charging-may-break-iphone-15s-apple-pay-chip.2405806/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e48f7da158fcbbfb8eda922b9d186206d7cbd92b15c0ef65771b9cd3a8e13c43","category":"Apple"}
