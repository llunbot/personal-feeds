In particular, he revealed that he has suspended a planned $800 million expansion of <a href=\"https://tylerperrystudios.com/\">his production studio</a> after seeing what OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/\">recently announced AI video generator</a> Sora can do.</p>\n\n<p>\"I have been watching AI very closely,\" Perry said in the interview. \"I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years... an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would’ve increased the backlot a tremendous size—we were adding 12 more soundstages. All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I’m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me.\"</p>\n<p>OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/\">revealed a preview</a> of Sora's capabilities last week. Sora is a text-to-video synthesis model, and it uses a neural network—previously trained on video examples—that can take written descriptions of a scene and turn them into high-definition video clips up to 60 seconds long. Sora caused shock in the tech world because it appeared to surpass other AI video generators in capability dramatically. It seems that a similar shock also rippled into adjacent professional fields. \"Being told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,\" Perry said in the interview.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005529#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005529&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f08a9c24e0caba1b11642dfa49618cead2a69dce9a91888ee01afad1b5b3cae1","category":"Tech"}
