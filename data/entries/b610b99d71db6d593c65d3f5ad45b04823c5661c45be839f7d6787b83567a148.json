I’d say the new trend of high-rise bars is just another band-aid instead of a proper fix. High-rise bars are having a moment, and Race Face wanted in on the party, so let’s see what they came up with.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Get Those Bars in the Sky</h3>\n<p>Previously, Race Face offered their Era bars in up to a 40 mm rise. Through some focus group divination, they arrived at 55 mm as the next iteration of rise would meet most folks’ needs. At the press camp, I joked that I had been riding my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mone-bikes-light-bar-review/\">Mone Light Bars</a> for a few years, which have more rise and width than the new Era bars. I find that when I talk to racers or people from places with trees, and I tell them I want 65 mm rise bars that are at least 820 mm wide, they look at me like I’m crazy. Thank goodness Cjell exists – though he still looks at me like I’m crazy, it is mutual.</p>\n<p>Now comparing the Light Bars to the new Era 55 bars is a bit of apples to oranges, despite the roughly similar dimensions. The main difference is the lack of a crossbar. Previous high-rise carbon bars (above 50mm rise) came with crossbars like the Mone Light Bars or the Whisky Milhouse. Crossbars look cool, but they also stiffen up the bars and limit flex.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-9.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Goldilocks Tune</h3>\n<p>Race Face has developed the Goldilocks Tune to give their bars a flexible but not too flexible characteristic. According to the press release, “[Race Face] set out to find the optimal balance of vertical compliance and lateral stiffness (based entirely on rider feedback) and found that 85% of riders preferred one particular sweet spot of vertical compliance.” Race Face understandably won’t say what that number is, only how it is measured, and thus we nod our heads at the marketing and engineering jargon-fest.</p>\n<p>I’ve mentioned this in previous handlebar reviews, but it is extremely hard to differentiate bar compliance amid the cacophony of moving parts on a full-suspension bike. I can squeeze the front wheel between my thighs and haul on the handlebars and prove they do indeed flex, but that isn’t how riding impacts will affect that bar. I’m hoping to have an excuse in the future to ride these bars on a rigid bike to truly narrow down the variables.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Lightest Rise</h3>\n<p>Safe to say, the engineers at Race Face worked some carbon mastery, and the new Era 55 handlebars are indeed comfortable and light. At 230g, the Era 55 bars are 20 to 30 grams lighter than competing ~50 mm rise carbon bars on the market. I doubt many people looking for 55 mm rise bars are concerned with a few grams difference over the comfort or fit benefit, but they may be out there.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-16.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-16.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-17.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-17.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Era SL System</h3>\n<p>While the Era 55 Bars come in 5 mm taller than most of the competition, one can also squeeze an extra 6mm of rise with the Era SL stem that was released a few weeks ago. The asymmetrical rise allows for +/- 6 mm of rise, depending on the orientation of the stem. So in conjunction with the stem, I’m getting 61 mm of rise.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-13.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-13.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-15.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-15.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-14.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-14.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Don’t Cut Em’!</h3>\n<p>It is important to note that Race Face does not recommend cutting these bars down past 760 mm. This is to preserve the character of the Goldilocks tune. As the bars are cut, the amount of leverage is lessened and therefore changes the character of the bars. If you know you want a shorter bar width, make sure you get the appropriate starting length to be cut down.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Race_Face_Era_55_Review-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Add Plenty of Rise and Little Weight</h3>\n<p>While I haven’t had hundreds of hours with the Era bars, I can say that I have enjoyed the rides in the past month. I lost only ~4 mm of total rise from my previous setup, losing a crossbar, a few grams, and adding compliance. I’m glad to see brands producing high high-rise carbon bars, as many bike companies seem apprehensive to increase stack height sufficiently. I wish the graphic designer at Race Face would calm down a bit, as the branding is too lavish for my taste. But that is Race Face’s style, and it really comes down to personal aesthetic preferences.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Goldilocks tune for damping trail chatter</li>\n<li>Lightest bar with this amount of rise</li>\n<li>Helps offset persistent low frame stack heights</li>\n<li>Aging lower back approved</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Carbon is expensive, but these are on par with the competition.</li>\n<li>Only 35 mm clamp</li>\n<li>Race Face branding is always a bit much</li>\n<li>800 mm is the widest option</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/first-ride-review-race-face-era-55-carbon-riser-handlebars/\">First Ride Review: Race Face Era 55 Carbon Riser Handlebars</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b610b99d71db6d593c65d3f5ad45b04823c5661c45be839f7d6787b83567a148","category":"Cycling"}
