Humans have genetically adapted to eating starchy foods, and our ancestors may have been carb-ivores even before modern <i>Homo sapiens </i>emerged.</p>\n<p>The salivary amylase gene, known as AMY1, is already known to have helped us adapt to eating carbs. It encodes amylase, an enzyme that breaks starches found in pasta and bread down to glucoseâ€”and may have given us a taste preference for them. Humans have multiple copies of the gene, which may help us produce high levels of the enzyme.</p>\n<p>Researchers from the University of Buffalo and the Jackson Laboratory have now found that, while most copies of this gene arose with the advent of farming, modern humans and our closest relatives had accumulated extra copies long before agriculture.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/craving-carbs-blame-an-ancient-gene/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/craving-carbs-blame-an-ancient-gene/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"907f8caa0a2274e382b6c432cf018aeaa4206c70545a1858b4a77b3d80e9d21e","category":"Tech"}
