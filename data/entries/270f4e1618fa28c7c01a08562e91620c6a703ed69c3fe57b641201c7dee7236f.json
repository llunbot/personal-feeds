Because these screens do refresh line by line, there is a tiny delay between when the lines at the top of the screen and lines at the bottom are refreshed. This can cause uneven scrolling issues like the ones observed on the iPad.</p>\n<p>We maintain that this effect is noticeable on the iPad mini in a way that it is <em>not</em> noticeable on other 60 Hz LCD iPads we've tested, like the iPad Air 4 and the latest $329 iPad. There's also a clear dividing line down the middle of the screen in portrait mode, as observed in our testing and in the video linked below—it's not a problem at the extreme edges of the display. The upshot is that the company doesn't believe there is a hardware or software issue to \"fix,\" and that the screen apparently is the way it is.</p>\n<p><strong>Original story</strong>: Apple's newest iPad mini was released to the general public on Friday, and over the weekend, users began to complain about a subtle scrolling problem when using the tablet in portrait mode (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/ipad-mini-6-jelly-scroll-issue-vertical/\">MacRumors has a good round-up post</a>). The tablet appears to refresh the left and right halves of its screen at slightly different rates, creating a subtle-but-noticeable \"jelly scroll\" effect. The Verge's Dieter Bohn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1440678843589689346\">has captured slow-motion video</a> that demonstrates the problem.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798690#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798690&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"270f4e1618fa28c7c01a08562e91620c6a703ed69c3fe57b641201c7dee7236f","category":"Tech"}
