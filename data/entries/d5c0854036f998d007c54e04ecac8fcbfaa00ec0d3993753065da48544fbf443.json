According to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630115/full\">a recent paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, the mockingbird follows similar musical rules when composing its songs to those used in human music.</p>\n<p>\"When you listen for a while to a mockingbird, you can hear that the bird isn't just randomly stringing together the melodies it imitates,\" <a href=\"https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/the-institute/news/news-article/article/mockingbird-song-decoded-1.html\">said co-author Tina Roeske</a>, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics. \"Rather, it seems to sequence similar snippets of melody according to consistent rules. In order to examine this hunch scientifically, however, we had to use quantitative analyses to test whether the data actually supported our hypotheses.\"</p>\n<p>Mockingbirds are known for their ability to mimic other birds and certain sounds from their surrounding environment, provided those sounds fall into the mockingbird's acoustic range. For example, the birds can mimic blue jays but not ravens, tree frogs but not bullfrogs. Over half of the mockingbird's songs are mimicry, and the species boasts an impressive repertoire composed of hundreds of types of phrases.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781239#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781239&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d5c0854036f998d007c54e04ecac8fcbfaa00ec0d3993753065da48544fbf443","category":"Tech"}
