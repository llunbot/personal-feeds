Apple launched the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips at the end of October 2023. The M3 MacBook Air launched since, but the rest of the Mac range has been silent this year, despite the M4 arriving in the iPad! We can expect the following updates soon:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 Mac mini &amp; Mac mini Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M3 chip has been out for more than a year and a Mac mini update mini is long overdue. The rumors indicate that the new Mac mini update is going to jump straight to the M4 chip, and we may see it before the end of 2024. However, there are also rumors that the Mac mini is getting a new, smaller design, in which case the wait could be a little longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">New Mac mini rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>October 202</em>4</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 MacBook Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The year has sped by and it’s now almost a year since the M3-series MacBook Pro models arrived. You guessed it, Apple is said to be about to update the range again. Rumor has it that the M4 MacBook Pro, and the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook PRo, will arrive in October. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html\">M4 MacBook Pro rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>October 202</em>4</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 iMac </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the M4 MacBook Pro we could also see an update to the iMac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2423527/m4-imac-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iMac M4 release date</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>October 202</em>4</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Despite the anticipated arrival of the M4 chips in October it looks like we could be waiting even longer for the other Macs to be updated. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 MacBook Air</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s popular laptop isn’t expected to be updated in October. For that one we could be waiting until spring 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air M4 release date</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Studio </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Studio is another Mac likely to bypass the M3 and jump straight to the M4 Max and M4 Ultra, the real surprise/disappointment is that Apple is making its creative customers wait so long for the update. If Apple doesn’t update the Mac Studio until June 2025 it will have been two years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M4 Mac Studio rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?

What people want is a return of a more professional iMac with a bigger screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is said to be working on a Pro version of the iMac, a return of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a> perhaps, or even larger. It sounds like an M4 Pro iMac might happen, but we could be waiting a little longer for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Larger iMac Pro rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?

Almost the whole range got a refresh in 2024, with the new iPad Air and iPad Pro in May and the iPad mini in October. What of the standard iPad?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>11th-gen iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th gen iPad joined the lineup in October 2022 so a new model can be expected soon. The 11th-gen iPad as likely to support Apple Intelligence, so it will need the A17 Pro chip used by the 2024 iPad mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>October 2024</em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhones </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A new set of iPhones arrived at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s 2024 iPhone event</a> on September 9, but what of the iPhone SE?  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t expect to see this in September, but there have been a few rumors about the iPhone SE. A supposed leak revealed a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2254092/iphone-se-4-cad-leak-6-1-inch-screen-face-id-notch-camera.html\">bigger screen, notch and Face ID</a>, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first we’ve heard of a bigger version of the iPhone SE. The question is, will it still feature the Home button?

Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 17 won’t arrive until September 2025, but there are already rumors about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 202</em>5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max and AirPods Pro have had the odd update since they launched a few years ago, but the next generation is yet to materialize. Will they get a full update in 2025? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait for new AirPods Pro could stretch beyond 2025. They could offer new health-related features when they arrive. As for the AirPods Max, now that Apple’s refreshed the colors it’s unlikely to do anything else for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 arrived in September 2024, with a larger screen, but there was no generational update for the Apple Watch Ultra or the Apple Watch SE. Expect bigger things for Apple Watch Ultra in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2023, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod with screen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker and control the HomePod via an iPhone (which can be a drain on the battery).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 2025</em></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp\" alt=\"HomePod with iPad screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>An HomePod that combines the screen of an iPad could be on the cards.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vision Pro successor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro is pricy and a little cumbersome, but Apple is said to be at work on two updated models: a less-expensive version, and another high-end model. Perhaps “Vision Pro 2” and “Vision Air?” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2489500/apples-vision-of-the-future-four-new-products-in-the-works.html\">four new AR/VR products</a> coming in 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.  These could include a cheaper Vision Pro model (at $2,000). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 2025 or later</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple released in 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hit the ground running in 2023 with new Macs and a new HomePod in January. Then at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC</a> in June the company launched no less than three new Macs and a brand new device – the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> – alongside revealing its plans for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS 14 Sonoma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 10</a>. Finally (maybe) Apple launched the new iPhone 15 series and the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/no-new-ipad-air-mini-pro-2023.html\">event</a> in September and then made macOS Sonoma and iOS 17 available for customers to download later that month. Then at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">Apple event on October 30</a> the company unveiled new MacBook Pro and iMac models.
