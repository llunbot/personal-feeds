These plasma waves are much more intense than anything that crashes onto a beach.</p>\n<p>NASA’s Juno spacecraft keeps coming across humongous plasma waves as it orbits Jupiter. These waves are actually known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs), and they occur when plasma from the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/parker-solar-probe-images-the-launch-of-the-solar-wind/\">solar wind</a> interacts with the magnetopause of a planet, the outer level of its magnetic field. The difference in velocity between the magnetopause and solar wind creates a furiously swirling wave—a vortex.</p>\n<p>“The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may be observed at the boundary that separates a planetary magnetic field (magnetosphere) from the stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun (solar wind); this boundary is known as the magnetopause,” the researchers said in a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL102921\">study</a> recently published in Geophysical Research Letters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959001#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959001&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed62e6a9cddd946a6893f2d0939ba63f32de3d6545e613e0211a64e255ce1190","category":"Tech"}
