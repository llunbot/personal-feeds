{"title":"Apple Unveils Mac Minis With M4 and M4 Pro Chips","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apples-new-mac-mini-is-more-mighty-more-mini-and-built-for-apple-intelligence/","date":1730234094000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With M4 Pro, it takes the advanced technologies in M4 and scales\nthem up to tackle even more demanding workloads. For more\nconvenient connectivity, it features front and back ports, and for\nthe first time includes Thunderbolt 5 for faster data transfer\nspeeds on the M4 Pro model.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The M4 Thunderbolt story is pretty simple: all USB-C ports on Macs with the regular M4 are Thunderbolt 4; all ports on Macs with the M4 Pro (and presumably, the Max and Ultra chips still to come) are Thunderbolt 5. Why you might care: Thunderbolt 4 supports 40 Gbps symmetrical send/receive; Thunderbolt 5 supports 80 Gbps symmetrical send/receive <em>or</em> 120 Gbps send / 40 Gbps receive (e.g., for displays).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The new Mac mini footprint is less than half the size of the\nprevious design at just 5 by 5 inches, so it takes up much less\nspace on a desk. The super-compact system is enabled by the\nincredible power efficiency of Apple silicon and an innovative\nthermal architecture, which guides air to different levels of the\nsystem, while all venting is done through the foot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The new Mini form factor sports a dramatically smaller footprint, but because it’s taller (which ought to be better for thermals), the difference isn’t as great by volume:</p>\n\n<table>\n\n<thead>\n<th></th><th>Height</th><th>Width</th><th>Depth</th><th>Area</th><th>Volume</th>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>M4 Mac Mini</td><td>5 cm</td><td>12.7 cm</td><td>12.7 cm</td><td>161 cm<sup>2</sup></td><td>807 cm<sup>3</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previous Mac Minis</td><td>3.58 cm</td><td>19.7 cm</td><td>19.7 cm</td><td>388 cm<sup>2</sup></td><td>1,389 cm<sup>3</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M2 Mac Studio</td><td>9.5 cm</td><td>19.7 cm</td><td>19.7 cm</td><td>388 cm<sup>2</sup></td><td>3,689 cm<sup>3</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apple TV 4K</td><td>3.1 cm</td><td>9.3 cm</td><td>9.3 cm</td><td>87 cm<sup>2</sup></td><td>268 cm<sup>3</sup></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>No cheating either: the power supply remains inside the Mac Mini case. (But as shown above, the Mac Mini remains quite a bit larger than an Apple TV 4K.) One odd detail is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/m4-mac-mini-bottom-power-button/\">the placement of the power button on the bottom of the case</a> — but it seems raised enough from the venting that it shouldn’t be a problem getting a finger under there.</p>\n\n<p>Base RAM goes from 8 to 16 GB (which appears to be true for all M4-based Macs) and goes up to a maximum of 64 GB with the M4 Pro, and all M4 Mac Minis support up to three displays. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/compare/?modelList=Mac-mini-M4,Mac-mini-M2,Mac-studio-2023\">See Apple’s Compare page</a> for more details on what’s new and changed.</p>\n\n<p>Also interesting is the announcement format. Rather than one 30–40 minute video announcing all M4 Macs at once, Apple has made separate 10-minute-ish mini keynotes for each. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaB7nCdId0Y\">iMacs yesterday</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtFm9n3NVzE\">Mac Mini today</a>, and presumably MacBook Pros tomorrow. And rather than shoot inside Steve Jobs Theater, they filmed at <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2024/09/09/the-observatory-apple-park-california/\">the new Observatory building</a> — a smaller setting for smaller announcements.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjpGvjy0Gxk\">a fun 2-minute stop-motion introduction commercial</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/29/m4-mac-mini\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d4665fb5a7e8a43d661200d47ffcc8519ae081aaf25d8f0c80356723a615cd9f","category":"Tech"}
