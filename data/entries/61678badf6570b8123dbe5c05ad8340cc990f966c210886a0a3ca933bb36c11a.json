It was the fleet leader, having tallied 19 missions over the course of more than three-and-a-half years. More importantly, it was the rocket that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/todays-the-day-weather-permitting-america-is-returning-to-space/\">thundered into space on May 30, 2020</a>, on a flight that made history on several counts.</p>\n<p>It was the first time a commercial rocket and spacecraft launched people into orbit, and ended a nine-year gap in America's ability to send astronauts into orbit from US soil, following the retirement of the space shuttle. This mission, known as Demo-2 and launched by SpaceX under contract with NASA, ended US reliance on Russian rockets to send crews to the International Space Station.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993381#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993381&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61678badf6570b8123dbe5c05ad8340cc990f966c210886a0a3ca933bb36c11a","category":"Tech"}
