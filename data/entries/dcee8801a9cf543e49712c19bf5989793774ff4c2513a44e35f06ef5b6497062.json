Last month, Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> with an all-new standalone 48-megapixel camera, and de With <a href=\"https://www.lux.camera/iphone-16e-camera-review-the-essentials/\">checked it out</a> to see how it compares to the cameras in Apple's flagship <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nOn paper, the ‌iPhone 16e‌, the ‌iPhone 16‌, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> seem to have the same main camera, described as a 48-megapixel Fusion camera that's able to take both 1x and 2x shots, but when you drill down into the specs, there's a difference. The ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ has a camera with an f/1.78 aperture, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ and 16e have a camera with an f/1.6 aperture. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ does not have sensor-shift optical image stabilization, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ does, so it's clear these are different cameras.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to de With, what Apple has done with the ‌iPhone 16e‌ is pair current-generation image processing enabled by the A18 chip with a smaller, older camera component. With just a single Wide lens, there's no Macro mode, no spatial photo or video capture, no Night mode for Portrait images, and no Cinematic or Action mode options when capturing video. There also aren't pro features like ProRAW.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an image test compared with the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ trended toward warmer images and it had a narrower field of view. The smaller sensor captured less detail, which de With said was most noticeable in lower light. 2x photos with the smaller sensor were lower quality with unpleasant processing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to de With, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ isn't on par with the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ or even the ‌iPhone 16‌, but it is on par with prior non-Pro iPhones and the ‌iPhone‌ 14 Pro. The fact that it has no sensor-shift stabilization was the biggest limiting factor because it cuts down on image quality in low light and in night shots.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDe With felt that the ‌iPhone 16e‌'s sensor has a grainy, moody sensor that he enjoyed as an alternative to the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌'s larger sensor. \"As the kids would say today, it's a vibe,\" de With wrote.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDe With's full review, complete with comparison images, can be <a href=\"https://www.lux.camera/iphone-16e-camera-review-the-essentials/\">read over on the Lux website</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/iphone-16e-camera-review/\">Here's How the iPhone 16e Camera Stacks Up Against Its Siblings</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-the-iphone-16e-camera-stacks-up-against-its-siblings.2452946/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dcee8801a9cf543e49712c19bf5989793774ff4c2513a44e35f06ef5b6497062","category":"Apple"}
