Even though this tool box is designed more for the hobbyist amateur bike mechanic, Unior doesn’t skimp on quality, with the Home Kit getting the same shop-level tools as you find in the Pro &amp; Master Kits, and the same rugged waterproof, lockable case.</p><p>Unior specifically focused on including the core tools most home mechanics would need, without adding any fluff to get the tool count up. They also factored in an extra foam block that buyers can custom cut to make space for the additional tools they need that may be specific to their bike (although, that’s not as easy to do neatly as you’d hope based on my own experience.)

The 170mm long 30€ Screw Pliers are designed to grab damaged bolt heads from 3-11mm in diameter.</p><h3>New Unior tools, kits &amp; toolboxes – Availability</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase.jpg\" alt=\"Unior Master Kit professional bike mechanic travel toolbox made in Europe, rolling\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13102110/Unior-Master-Kit-professional-bike-mechanic-travel-toolbox-made-in-Europe_rolling-suitcase-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\"></a></p><p>Unior doesn’t launch products on a model year cycle. And since they manufacture everything in-house in the factories in Slovenia, new products essentially get launched once they are available. So for the most part, every one of the new tools above is available now, subject to local stock from distributors in Europe, North America, or beyond.</p><p>The only exception would be the new Master Kit &amp; Home Kit toolboxes as they haven’t officially been launched yet. We simply got an early sneak peek. The first batch of Home Kits are finishing production now, and will be in stock before the end of September. The first run of Master Kits and their separate empty cases will be available in October 2021.</p><section><a href=\"http://www.unior-bike.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Unior-Bike.com</em></a></section></section></article></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d874b87bcb1baa4a4908cc7b191e291eb98bb6aa75602983e6dde4f145de9966","category":"Cycling"}
