The EU's decision aimed to reduce electronic waste and improve charger interoperability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe UK government, which previously stated it was not considering similar rules, is now exploring whether adopting USB-C as a standard would benefit businesses, consumers, and the environment. The consultation will run for eight weeks, ending on December 4, 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKey points under consideration include:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li>Standardizing USB-C as the common charging port</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Implementing harmonized fast-charging technology</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Allowing consumers to purchase devices without chargers</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Introducing labeling requirements for charging information</li>\r<br />\n</ul>The government acknowledges that many manufacturers of smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, and laptops have already adopted USB-C for the UK market voluntarily to avoid supply chain complexities. For example, Apple, which long resisted changing its proprietary Lightning port, adopted USB-C for new iPhones last year, while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/apple-still-sells-these-lightning-products/\">last few Lightning products</a> are likely to make the transition next year. However, the government says it seeks to understand the implications of formally implementing such requirements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, the new iPad mini, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/whats-in-the-ipad-mini-7-box/\">announced on Tuesday</a>, will not include a charger in the box for several European countries, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. The change is likely in response to EU regulations regarding electronic waste, but even some European countries that are not part of the EU are impacted.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/uk-considers-usb-c-common-charging-standard/\">UK Considers Adopting USB-C as Common Charging Standard</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-considers-adopting-usb-c-as-common-charging-standard.2440195/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a62434ab5f6f87677f8738765b1bb58e9db28647570ade884d671b5df6e29d17","category":"Apple"}
