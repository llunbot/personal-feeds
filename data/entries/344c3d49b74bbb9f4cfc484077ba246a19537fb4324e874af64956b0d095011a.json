And the odds on the announcements including a new iPad Pro with an OLED display just got a lot better, thanks to the discovery of giveaway code in the latest iPadOS beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As first spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/09/ipados-17-5-new-display-ipad-pro/&amp;xcust=1-1-2300493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a>, the beta of iPadOS 17.5 contains references to both unreleased iPads and new display firmware. There are four identifiers that don’t match any currently known models:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad16,3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad16,4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad16,5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad16,6</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For reference, the last batch of iPads back in 2022 had pre-launch identifiers <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/07/05/apple-is-preparing-three-new-mac-studio-models&amp;xcust=1-1-2300493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">beginning with 14 or 15</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As 9to5Mac notes, these are likely to correspond to the Wi-Fi and cellular versions of the upcoming 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It’s less likely that these could correspond to any new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air models</a> because those won’t get OLED until some time after it arrives on the Pro. And the iPad mini and 10th-gen iPad aren’t expected to get updates until the fall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also references in the code to gestures that will be enabled by a new Apple Pencil: “LongSqueeze” and “DoubleSqueeze.” It has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2286875/apple-pencil-3-squeeze-gesture-ipados-17-5-beta.html\">previously been rumored</a> that Apple is working on squeeze gestures for a new Apple Pencil that will reportedly debut alongside the new tablets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a long wait for new iPads, but OLED technology could be a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2172817/ipad-pro-oled-display-always-on-standby-dynamic-island.html\">real game-changer</a> for the Pro models. It’s likely to give the upmarket model an always-on display and Standby mode, and OLED is generally better than LED (even mini-LED) for color fidelity, viewing angles, and power-efficiency. The upgrade could, however, come with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2196113/massively-more-expensive-new-ipad-pro.html\">jacked-up price tag</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news on the new models, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro 2024 rumor roundup</a>.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"344c3d49b74bbb9f4cfc484077ba246a19537fb4324e874af64956b0d095011a","category":"Apple"}
