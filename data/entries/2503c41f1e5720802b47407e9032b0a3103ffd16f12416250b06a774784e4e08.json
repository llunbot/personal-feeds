The update should be widely released in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>FaceTime</h2>\r<br />\nApple says FaceTime will use more data in Low Power Mode on iOS 18 when network conditions are good, for improved video call quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Siri</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18 includes a new setting that can \"significantly\" improve Siri's audio quality in Bluetooth-enabled vehicles that lack CarPlay, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new option can be found in the Settings app under Siri → Siri Responses → \"Respond over Media Source.\" The description for this setting says that \"Siri will respond over A2DP car stereos, which is ideal while listening to media from your phone.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wallet</h2>\r<br />\nAs noted <a href=\"https://x.com/nicolas09F9/status/1802785545195798549\">by Nicolás Álvarez</a>, the notes indicate that users adding an ID to the Wallet app on the iPhone may now be asked to take a Live Photo instead of, or in addition to, conducting a series of head and facial movements. Apple says the Live Photo will be evaluated by the device to ensure that the real and rightful person is adding the ID.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first announced the ability to add a driver's license or ID to the Wallet app in 2021, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/apple-wallet-app-ids-slow-adoption/\">only four U.S. states have rolled out the feature</a> so far, including Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia. The feature provides a convenient and contactless way to display proof of identity or age at select airports, businesses, and venues.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-facetime-siri-wallet-changes/\">iOS 18 Beta Notes Reveal More Changes for FaceTime, Siri, and Wallet</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-beta-notes-reveal-more-changes-for-facetime-siri-and-wallet.2429456/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2503c41f1e5720802b47407e9032b0a3103ffd16f12416250b06a774784e4e08","category":"Apple"}
