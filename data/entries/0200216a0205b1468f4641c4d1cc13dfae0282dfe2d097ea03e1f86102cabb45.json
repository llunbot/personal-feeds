As a result, Unimicron is expected to aggressively secure non-Apple ABF substrate orders to cut risk.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMacBook shipments are also expected to be impacted by the change in demand structure in the post-COVID-19 era will, with the number of people working from home declining and purchasing power falling due to inflation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo believes a new redesigned ‌MacBook Air‌ powered by next-generation ‌Apple Silicon‌ will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/kuo-macbook-air-mass-production-third-quarter/\">enter mass production in the early third quarter of 2022</a>, making the second half of next year a product transition period that will have an impact on MacBook orders.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is still expected to launch redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models before the end of this year, likely to be announced via a digital event in October or November. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> beta references <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/\">two new built-in display resolutions</a> that likely correspond to the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. The new display resolutions are listed as \"3456 x 2234 Retina\" and \"3024 x 1964 Retina,\" which would represent an increase in pixel density for a sharper image if the displays are the expected sizes.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/kuo-apple-silicon-macbook-orders-cut-1h-2022/\">Kuo: Apple Silicon MacBook Shipments to Be Cut in First Half of 2022 Due to Component Shortages and Other Factors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-silicon-macbook-shipments-to-be-cut-in-first-half-of-2022-due-to-component-shortages-and-other-factors.2313847/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hJUqMzmZy8M:XTyKlTwIdc0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hJUqMzmZy8M:XTyKlTwIdc0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hJUqMzmZy8M\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0200216a0205b1468f4641c4d1cc13dfae0282dfe2d097ea03e1f86102cabb45","category":"Apple"}
