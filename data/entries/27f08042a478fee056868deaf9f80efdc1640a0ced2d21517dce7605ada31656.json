First <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/salsa-cycles-prototype-emtb-gravel-ebikes/\" target=\"_blank\">teased at Sea Otter in 2023</a>, and then <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/salsa-cycles-electric-bikes-confluence-light-e-gravel-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">teased some more a year ago</a>, the Tributary is finally flowing into bike shops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new gravel eBike comes with mid-drive Bosch power, rack and fender mounts (naturally), a 120mm carbon suspension fork, and clearance for 29 x 2.6 tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-GRX.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"979\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-GRX.webp\" alt=\"Salsa Tributary C Gravel eBike GRX\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-GRX.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-GRX-297x227.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-GRX-120x92.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-GRX-768x587.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Salsa Cycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Salsa’s calling this new bike a “rugged-road adventure bike”, designed to “devour big, burley dirt routes”. By blending the Tributary’s balanced geometry, huge tire clearance, intuitive assist, and onboard cargo, it’s ready for the long haul.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tributary Frame Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tibutary’s frame is made from high-modulus carbon fiber and runs a 148 x 12 Boost thru-axle and Class 5 VRS (vibration reduction system). It uses an IS52 headset with integrated cable routing and a 30.9mm seat post with internal dropper post routing. There is also internal cable routing with a port for an integrated lighting system.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-non-drive.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-non-drive.webp\" alt=\"Salsa Tributary C Gravel eBike non-drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-non-drive.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-non-drive-297x168.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-non-drive-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-non-drive-768x434.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses a flat mount standard for the brakes with 160mm min and 180mm max rotors. There are rack and fender mounts, it’s SRAM UDH compatible, and it sports two water bottle bosses inside the main triangle on <em>all</em> sizes. Salsa has also enclosed the internal battery, which adds to the stiffness and strength of the frame. The Tributary frame accommodates up to 29″ x 2.6 tires (29 x 2.3 with fenders). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Fork Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tributary uses a purpose-built carbon fork that’s built for compliance, weight savings, and cargo capacity. The fork comes with a 110 x 15mm thru axle and a flat mount brake standard. It uses internal routing for the brake and has abrasion-resistant wear protection plates on the inside of the fork’s legs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair.webp\" alt=\"Salsa Tributary C Gravel eBike apair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-apair-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It carries with it two sets of three-pack mounts (one set per fork leg), and has low-rider rack mounts as well. The suspension-corrected rigid fork, and the 120mm travel fork option both have clearance for 29 x 3.0″ tires (29 x 2.4″ with fender).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Bosch Drive System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bosch Performance Line Speed drive system that comes with the Tributary uses a multi-sensor approach. This delivers a controlled and natural feel when riding the bike. It delivers 85Nm of torque and up to 28mph max assist.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track.webp\" alt=\"Salsa Tributary C Gravel eBike single track\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-single-track-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The internal 625Wh Bosch PowerTube is fully enclosed, but removable through the motor opening for service. Also, the charge port is located on the motor node. It’s capable of up to 875Wh using the Bosch PowerMore 250Wh range extender battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack.webp\" alt=\"Salsa Tributary C Gravel eBike more singletrack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-more-singletrack-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tributary uses the Bosch BRC3100 top tube controller, but a handlebar 31.8 Mini Remote will be available in the fall of 2025. You can tune the riding modes to fit your needs via the Bosch Flow app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tributary Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-geo.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"619\" height=\"963\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-geo.webp\" alt=\"Salsa Tributary C Gravel eBike geo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-geo.webp 619w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-geo-193x300.webp 193w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Salsa-Tributary-C-Gravel-eBike-geo-77x120.webp 77w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bikes will be coming in five sizes: XS, S, M, L, and XL.
