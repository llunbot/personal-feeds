And it was ahead of its time in many ways: clearance for 29” x 2.1” tires, suspension-corrected geo, routing port for a dropper post, and internal frame routing. The brand just announced eight total colorways for 2025, including this new Seafoam &amp; Maroon option. You still get the ahead-of-the-curve tire clearance and off-road tuned geometry, just in more colors and an in-depth custom build menu.
