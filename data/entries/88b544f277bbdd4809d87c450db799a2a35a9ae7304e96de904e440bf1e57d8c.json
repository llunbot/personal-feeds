{"title":"Apple Watch Series 9 Now Available on Apple's Refurbished Store in U.S.","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/refurbished-apple-watch-series-9/","date":1713976024000,"content":"Apple today began selling certified refurbished Apple Watch Series 9 models in the U.S. for the first time since the device was released in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" />\r<br />\nThe refurbished Series 9 models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models, with pricing starting at $339, down from $399. A <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FR903LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-41mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-S-M-Storm-Blue-Sport-Band\">variety</a> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FRJ83LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Graphite-Stainless-Steel-Case-with-S-M-Midnight-Sport-Band\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FRHN3LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-S-M-Starlight-Sport-Band\">configurations</a> are available as of writing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says it puts all of its refurbished products through a thorough cleaning process and inspection, and performs full functionality testing. In general, refurbished products sold directly by Apple have a very good reputation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike new Series 9 models sold directly by Apple in the U.S. currently, we expect that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-website-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-removal/\">Blood Oxygen app is deactivated</a> on the refurbished models, due to a legal battle with medical technology company Masimo. Last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/itc-opposes-apple-watch-sales-ban-pause/\">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents. Apple is appealing the decision, and could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/\">re-enable the Blood Oxygen app with a watchOS update</a> if it is overturned.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a reminder, Apple began selling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/refurbished-apple-watch-ultra-2-in-us/\">refurbished Apple Watch Ultra 2 models</a> in the U.S. and select other countries last week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/refurbished-apple-watch-series-9/\">Apple Watch Series 9 Now Available on Apple's Refurbished Store in U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-now-available-on-apples-refurbished-store-in-u-s.2424826/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88b544f277bbdd4809d87c450db799a2a35a9ae7304e96de904e440bf1e57d8c","category":"Apple"}
