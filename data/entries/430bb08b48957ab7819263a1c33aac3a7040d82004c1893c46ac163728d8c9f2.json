Particularly rings with smaller teeth count. IRD, or Interloc Racing Design, was formed in 1987 at the height of the MTB boom in America. Its latest product is a line of 104 or 110 BCD chainrings ($69.95). These rings are available in black or silver and in 34 through 38 tooth counts; 40 tooth count on the way in February for select rings.</p>\n<p>These rings are 1x compatible without the use of a chain keep, but you might find that you’d need one if your rear derailleur doesn’t have a clutch. They’ll look great with your vintage MTB cranks, when paired with 1x chainring bolts.</p>\n<p>You can order IRD products at your local bike shop through <a href=\"https://www.somafabshop.com/shop/category/recent-arrivals-8359?category=8359&amp;search=dreamcatcher\" target=\"_blank\">Merry Sales</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ird-dreamcatcher-110-bcd-1x-rings/\">IRD 110 BCD 1x Rings: Perfect for a 1x Vintage MTB Build</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"430bb08b48957ab7819263a1c33aac3a7040d82004c1893c46ac163728d8c9f2","category":"Cycling"}
