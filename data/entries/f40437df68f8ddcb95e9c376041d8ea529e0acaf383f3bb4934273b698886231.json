Santa Cruz Bicycles wants to help you ditch the car with the announcement of its fourth eBike, the new Skitch. Earlier this month Santa Cruz announced a more progressive geo for their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-santa-cruz-stigmata-gravel-bike-suspension-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">Stigmata gravel bike</a>. But, what if the Stigmata was a 1/2 degree more slack … and came electrified? Well, that’s the new Skitch eBike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-flat-bar-drop-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-flat-bar-drop-bar.png\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Skitch flat bar drop bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-flat-bar-drop-bar.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-flat-bar-drop-bar-297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-flat-bar-drop-bar-120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-flat-bar-drop-bar-768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-flat-bar-drop-bar-400x225.png 400w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c. Santa Cruz Bicycles</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At a claimed weight of only 30lbs, the new Skitch eBike is said to be fast and nimble. The powerful and light <a href=\"https://fazua.com/en/products/ride-60/\" target=\"_blank\">Fazua Ride 60 Motor</a> provides enough power to get up to 28mph (32kph in Canada). It also has a claimed range of over 60 miles. Santa Cruz is hoping the lightweight eBike will inspire you to ride more and drive less.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Watch the Video About Skitch</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The motor gives the rider 60Nm of torque giving you real climbing power, and an “outta-the-hole” punch to get up and go from the traffic lights. Furthermore, its light weight makes it easy to carry up some stairs, load on the bus, train, or the back of your vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_1032-Large-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Skitch riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_1032-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_1032-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_1032-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_1032-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_1032-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_1032-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_4927-Large-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Skitch riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_4927-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_4927-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_4927-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_4927-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_4927-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SLorencePhoto_day3_4927-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Available as a drop bar long-range gravel bike, or flat bar urban rocket, the Skitch is fast, nimble, and slick. The carbon frame contains a 430Wh battery that Santa Cruz says only takes 3.5 hours to fully charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with three power modes, Breeze (conservative), River, and Rocket (faster). These modes are easily accessed with the handlebar-mounted ring controller, allowing the rider to pick what kind of range they want to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_014-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Skitch charging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_014-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_014-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_014-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_014-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_014-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_014-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_010-Large-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Skitch\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_010-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_010-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_010-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_010-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_010-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MY24_Skitch_Details_010-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has an easy-to-access spot above the bottom bracket to plug the battery in. Plus, there is a handy battery level indicator on the top tube. Additionally, Skitch’s motor is “drag-free”, making pedaling home, un-assisted much easier if you run out of battery power. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2455\" height=\"1006\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits.png\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Skitch build kits\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits.png 2455w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits-297x122.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits-800x328.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits-120x49.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits-768x315.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits-1536x629.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/santa-Cruz-Skitch-build-kits-2048x839.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Available with a CC Carbon frame only and in matte olive green color, the Skitch comes in sizes S through XXL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who’s the Skitch for? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-turning-corner.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Santa-Cruz-Skitch-turning-corner.jpeg\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Skitch turning corner\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Santa Cruz says: “<em>The Skitch is built for the person who wants to ride as much as they can while also supporting their weekend cycling habit.
