The data shows flattish temperatures over the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar3/wg1/the-climate-system-an-overview/fig2-21-5/\">last millennium</a>, like the handle of a Hockey stick, ending in a \"blade\" of rapidly rising temperatures since the industrial revolution. The idea first appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/33859\">paper</a> by Michael Mann and Raymond Bradley of the University of Massachusetts and Malcolm Hughes of the University of Arizona. The work became famous after appearing in a UN climate report, after which it was the focus of climate denial, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-environment-50396797\">hacking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-scientist/u-s-supreme-court-lets-climate-scientists-defamation-claim-proceed-idUSKBN1XZ1QF\">defamation</a>, and disinformation, all of which was dramatized in a recent BBC TV drama called “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVfTXqNYoVU\">The Trick</a>.”</p>\n<p>Today, in a paper published by Nature, scientists show that the \"handle\" of the \"hockey stick\" extends back 9,500 years, while its \"blade\" is taller—the last decade was 1.5° C hotter than the average temperature over the last 11,700 years. \"Human-caused global temperature change during the last century was likely faster than any changes during the last 24,000 years,\" said lead author Dr. Matt Osman of the University of Arizona.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Osman-et-al-animated-world-map.gif\" /><p>An animation showing the warming that ended the last ice age.

For the new study, scientists carefully vetted over 500 proxy records from oceans around the world; the data shows the fossilized remains of plankton and microbes in sediments where the age is known from radiocarbon dating.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811732#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811732&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e9c66fefb1f6759930c9116e7b828be8c26fd235e825c0f9b4061d3afcf2e01","category":"Tech"}
