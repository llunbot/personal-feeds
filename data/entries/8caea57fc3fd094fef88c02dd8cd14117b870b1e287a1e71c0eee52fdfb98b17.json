But when integrated graphics push forward, it can open up possibilities for people who want to play games but can only afford a cheap desktop (or who have to make do with whatever their parents will pay for, which was the big limiter on my PC gaming experience as a kid).</p>\n\n<p>That, plus an unrelated but accordant interest in building small mini-ITX-based desktops, has kept me interested in AMD’s G-series Ryzen desktop chips (which it sometimes calls “APUs,” to distinguish them from the Ryzen CPUs). And the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/integrated-gpus-in-ryzen-8000g-desktop-cpus-compete-with-low-end-graphics-cards/\">Ryzen 8000G chips</a> are a big upgrade from the 5000G series that immediately preceded them (this makes sense, because as we all know the number 8 immediately follows the number 5).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999511#p3\">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999511&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8caea57fc3fd094fef88c02dd8cd14117b870b1e287a1e71c0eee52fdfb98b17","category":"Tech"}
