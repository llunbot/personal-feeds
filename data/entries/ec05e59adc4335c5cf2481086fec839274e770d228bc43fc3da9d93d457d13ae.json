After admitting the state-affiliated label was wrong, Musk changed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npr\">NPR's tag</a> yesterday to \"Government Funded Media\"—even though NPR gets less than 1 percent of its annual funding directly from the US government.</p>\n<p>The state-affiliated tag took NPR and many others by surprise, in part because it contradicted Twitter's own policy that cited NPR and the BBC as examples of state-financed media organizations that retain editorial independence. Twitter has historically applied its state-affiliated tag to state-controlled news organizations like Russia's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RT_com\">RT</a> and China's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XHNews\">Xinhua</a>.</p>\n<p>Twitter changed its policy to remove the reference to editorial independence at NPR and the BBC, but didn't scrub the old language from another <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/state-affiliated-china\">Twitter help page</a> that still describes both NPR and the BBC as editorially independent. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC\">BBC's main Twitter account</a> is also newly labeled as \"Government Funded Media\" after previously having no label.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930327#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930327&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ec05e59adc4335c5cf2481086fec839274e770d228bc43fc3da9d93d457d13ae","category":"Tech"}
