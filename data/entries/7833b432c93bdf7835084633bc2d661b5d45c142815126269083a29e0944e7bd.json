As many <em>MacRumors</em> readers have noticed, the current version of Safari appears to be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate despite the fact that the new machines support refresh rates up to 120Hz. \"Updated smooth scroll animations to run at 120Hz on 120Hz displays,\" reads Apple's release notes for the update. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/promotion-is-not-fully-working-out-of-the-box-in-e-g-safari-chrome-etc.2319610/\">have been multiple complaints</a> about Safari's stuttering, janky scrolling on the 120Hz MacBook Pro models due to its frame rate limitations, which Apple appears to be addressing in the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari, so after the 120Hz refresh rate update has been thoroughly tested with this browser, we should see it come to the main Safari release.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences to anyone who has <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/\">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/\">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's aim with ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/15/apple-safari-preview-135-120hz-scrolling/\">Apple Adds 120Hz Scrolling for New MacBook Pro Models in Latest Safari Technology Preview Release</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-120hz-scrolling-for-new-macbook-pro-models-in-latest-safari-technology-preview-release.2323520/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S6nWBkI01oI:0GpNT0-Bo0Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S6nWBkI01oI:0GpNT0-Bo0Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7833b432c93bdf7835084633bc2d661b5d45c142815126269083a29e0944e7bd","category":"Apple"}
