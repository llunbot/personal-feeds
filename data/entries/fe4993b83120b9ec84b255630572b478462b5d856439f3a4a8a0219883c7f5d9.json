That's according to the leaker known as \"Ice Universe,\" who has divulged accurate information about Apple's plans in the past.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/\">multiple sources</a>, despite minimal design changes, both iPhone 16 Pro models will increase in size this year. The iPhone 16 Pro is said to be 6.3 inches (up from 6.1), while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to measure in at 6.9 inches (up from 6.7), potentially making it Apple's biggest iPhone ever. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut it seems that Apple isn't just relying on larger physical dimensions to make the viewing experience more immersive. <a href=\"https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797408311513600503\">According to Ice Universe</a>, this year's Pro models will also have reduced bezels that could be the thinnest yet seen on any smartphone, including those on the Samsung Galaxy S24. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe breakthrough for achieving this could be Apple's rumored use of Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, which allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the circuitry under the display, resulting in even slimmer bezels. Ice Universe did not mention BRS, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/\">rumors</a> out of Asia have referenced the technology in relation to iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-max-biggest-rumored-features/\">5 Biggest Changes Rumored for iPhone 16 Pro Max</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nLast year, Apple reduced the bezels on iPhone 15 Pro models using low-injection pressure over-molding, or LIPO, to shrink the display border size to 1.5 millimeters (versus around 2.2 millimeters on iPhone 14 models). Besides that, Apple has not significantly tweaked iPhone screen sizes since the introduction of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12 models in 2020. But as mentioned, things are set to change with the Pro models in the 2024 iPhone 16 lineup. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/universeice/\">UniverseIce</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels-smartphone/\">iPhone 16 Pro Could Break Record for Thinnest Bezels on a Smartphone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-could-break-record-for-thinnest-bezels-on-a-smartphone.2428008/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fe4993b83120b9ec84b255630572b478462b5d856439f3a4a8a0219883c7f5d9","category":"Apple"}
