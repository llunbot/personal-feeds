The number of zero-days tracked this month is considerably higher than the monthly average this year. September so far is at 10, compared with a total of 60 from January through August, according to security firm Mandiant. The company <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/zero-days-exploited-2022\">tracked</a> 55 zero-days in 2022 and 81 in 2021.</p>\n<p>A sampling of the affected companies and products includes iOS and macOS, Windows, Chrome, Firefox, Acrobat and Reader, the Atlas VPN, and Ciscoâ€™s Adaptive Security Appliance Software and its Firepower Threat Defense. The number of apps is likely to grow because a single vulnerability that allows hackers to execute malicious code when users open a booby-trapped image included in a message or web page is present in possibly hundreds of apps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968268#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968268&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d10326ae114b0d710b7d2ef93310190c39cc98557269e43921096383c362cdf0","category":"Tech"}
