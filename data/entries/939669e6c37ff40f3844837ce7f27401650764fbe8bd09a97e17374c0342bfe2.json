In the <a href=\"https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1748413910636441978\">liner notes</a> for my first CD release in 2003, I wrote about a day when computers would potentially put me out of business, churning out music automatically at a pace I could not match. While I don't actively post music on that site anymore, that day is almost here.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, a group of ex-DeepMind employees launched <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/\">Udio</a>, a new AI music synthesis service that can create novel high-fidelity musical audio from written prompts, including user-provided lyrics. It's similar to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/mit-license-text-becomes-viral-sad-girl-piano-ballad-generated-by-ai/\">Suno</a>, which we covered on Monday. With some key human input, Udio can create facsimiles of human-produced music in genres like <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/songs/jGjYfsRosZjYTkSBdFgEyF\">country</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/songs/282ZPSyaunNC8GjegZ1LD1\">barbershop quartet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/songs/6ok7R3CsSf4Us7fM9Jvuty\">German pop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/songs/xtju1X31YfVbKWTCGd4yw7\">classical</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/songs/s57gWkoWhkEJvMsCN8ydEw\">hard rock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/songs/jYExega6Titmeocp8nrbk2\">hip hop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udio.com/songs/eY7xtug1dV6hbfCDhyHJua\">show tunes</a>, and more. It's currently free to use during a beta period.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n            </div>\n    </figure>\n<p>Udio is also <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1c0mjkg/udio_ai_music_generation_is_scary/\">freaking out</a> some musicians on Reddit. As we mentioned in our Suno piece, Udio is exactly the kind of AI-powered music generation service that over 200 musical artists were afraid of when they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/billie-eilish-pearl-jam-200-artists-say-ai-poses-existential-threat-to-their-livelihoods/\">signed an open protest letter</a> last week.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016112#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016112&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"939669e6c37ff40f3844837ce7f27401650764fbe8bd09a97e17374c0342bfe2","category":"Tech"}
