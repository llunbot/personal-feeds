Apple says the temporary store will be located on the second level of the outdoor shopping center, just in front of the stairs and escalator leading to that level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-Store-La-Encantada-Tucson-AZ.jpeg\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1612\" />\r<br />\nApple will likely renovate its original store at La Encantada while operating out of the temporary location, but the company did not share details or a timeframe. Apple first opened a store there in 2004, and its interior design is now dated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/apple-store-revamps-long-island-and-fairfax/\">we reported</a> that Apple would be opening a relocated store in Fairfax, Virginia, and a temporary store at Roosevelt Field on Long Island in New York. Apple has since announced that both of these stores will open on November 9 as well. Overall, it will be an eventful weekend for Apple retail in the U.S., with three stores on the move.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/three-apple-stores-moving-this-weekend/\">Apple Stores Moving This Weekend in Three U.S. Cities, Including Tucson</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stores-moving-this-weekend-in-three-u-s-cities-including-tucson.2442088/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d01e18f455c01fa1aae67e56b74491c1e9b809ff3e95bb0a67bf25b9c2170714","category":"Apple"}
