Director Danny Boyle is back with more zombie-virus dystopian horror in his new film set in the same fictional world, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later\"><em>28 Years Later</em></a>—not so much a direct sequel but the start of a new planned trilogy.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for <em>28 Days Later</em> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Weeks_Later\"><em>28 Weeks Later</em></a> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>In <em>28 Days Later</em>, a highly contagious \"Rage Virus\" is accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turn into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attack the uninfected—so-called \"fast zombies.\" Transmitted by bites, scratches, or even just by getting a drop of infected blood in one's mouth, the virus spreads rapidly, effectively collapsing society. A bicycle courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens from a coma 28 days later to find London mostly deserted, apart from a handful of survivors fleeing the infected hordes, and joins them in the pursuit of safety. Jim (barely) survives, and we see zombies dying of starvation in the streets during the denouement.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/sony-releases-new-trailer-for-28-years-later/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/sony-releases-new-trailer-for-28-years-later/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e8fb9577b1510e9498a850ea64e690926ca8b7ed806c47e8b0e6452ff044703","category":"Tech"}
