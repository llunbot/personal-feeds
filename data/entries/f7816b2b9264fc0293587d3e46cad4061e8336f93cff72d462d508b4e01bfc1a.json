Well, it’s because we’ve parted ways with TPC. Read on for TPC’s official press release announcement on the split and what this means for the future of The Radavist with a letter from John Watson below…<span></span></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“After two years in partnership, working together under the same ownership, TPC and The Radavist have made the decision to part ways. The publishing brand was transitioned back to its previous owner – and founder – John Watson.</em></p>\n<p><em>The two brands accomplished much together these past two years, including the development of a lucrative content-commerce business and an increase in material that the publication’s loyal followers were hungry for.</em></p>\n<p><em>The decision to return the brand back to John was made after TPC’s latest round of strategic planning, and the efforts to double down on the brand’s core retail business and TPC messaging. We wish nothing but the best for John and The Radavist team, and will continue to support their publication for many years to come.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Over the past two years, I’ve learned a lot from TPC in terms of how to grow a media company, and that experience has been all the more enjoyable thanks to the knowledgeable and friendly staff at TPC. The Radavist will emerge a better media organization because of TPC’s insight and I wish the company the best of luck on its journey.” John Watson, founder of The Radavist.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/CaliforniaSpring23-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>So What Does This Mean?</h3>\n<p>As you might expect, there are going to be a few changes. For the better, I’d argue. For one, Cari and I are now co-owners of The Radavist LLC in New Mexico. In addition to being the designer of all of our merch for the past seven years—and most likely packing some of your merch orders with TLC—Cari has helped run our advertising program and manage the finances of the website. She’s played a massive, often behind-the-scenes, role in growing and shaping The Radavist and she deserves to be a co-owner.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/JohnCari-14-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo Kyle Klain</em></p>\n<p>The need for help was one of the primary reasons I sold The Radavist, to begin with. Cari and I were <em>fried</em>. I was doing all the content creation and management on my own. Cari was running everything else. I wanted to hire additional employees but we weren’t making enough money to do so. Like some people, I have a hard time asking for help and TPC serendipitously reached out at a time when I was feeling run down and burnt out.</p>\n<p>For those of you who don’t know Cari, let me pass the mic to her:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“John and I might be one of the yin and yang-iest duo around and yet somehow we are able to work well together without completely losing our minds. I probably bring more of the left brain to the table but we converge over a shared love of art and beautiful spaces. My 20+ years of production and design experience in the outdoor industry has found a perfect home at The Radavist – I keep the amount of bikes in our house to a reasonable number (debatable) and I have fulfilled a lifetime dream of designing socks (no lie!) I’m incredibly excited and feel fortunate to take what we have learned over the last handful of years together to continue to push and evolve our content and design forever forward. – Much love, Cari Carmean”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/Aquarius-36-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo Kyle Klain</em></p>\n<p>Now, two years later, we are stronger than ever thanks to our editorial team.

When I started this website in 2006, it was just a side passion project to get me through my downtime at my architecture job in New York City. I’d shoot photos all weekend and write posts at night during the week. When the economy crashed and the architecture industry deflated in 2008, I leaned on the website for my full-time work and began to sell ads. We have a lot of healthy relationships with advertisers but the times are changing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Aquarius-Hut-Trail-System-204.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Don’t Worry, There Will NOT Be a Paywall!</h3>\n<p>Companies want more than just a banner ad, so we’re going to give them that and you’re going to benefit from this!  We’re offering our <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Group Ride Subscription Plan</strong></a> to readers of The Radavist for $6.66 a month or $69.69 a year.
