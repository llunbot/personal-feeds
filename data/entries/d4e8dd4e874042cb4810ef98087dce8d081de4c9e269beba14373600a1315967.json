Despite rumors of major design changes, the Apple Watch 10 turned out to be more or less identical to every Apple Watch sold over the last few years. The display was just a tad larger and the body was slightly thinner, but overall it was very similar to the Series 9. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point you might look to the old adage: “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it”. Apple’s Watch follows a proven formula that has brought a lot of success. It should be no surprise that the company isn’t rocking the boat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be forgivable, but Apple didn’t even update the Apple Watch Ultra or Apple Watch SE in 2024, leaving both with an older processor generation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily this year it looks like Apple will deliver some long awaited Apple Watch features. Read on to find out what’s in store for Apple Watch Series 11 in the fall of 2025? Here’s what we’ve heard so far about the 2025 Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll run though what’s expected for each Apple Watch model below, starting with the Apple Watch Series 11. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch Series 11: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Launch at September iPhone event: Tuesday September 9 (probable)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pre-order from September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On sale from September 19</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For years now, Apple has announced the new Apple Watch together with the new iPhone at a September event, with both products going on sale the following week. We haven’t heard anything to make us think that won’t be the case again this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most likely date is the second Tuesday of September, which is September 9. Pre-orders for the Apple Watch Series 11 will probably begin that Friday (September 12) with general availability in stores a week later (September 19).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch Series 11: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Likely to start at $399, unless Apple has to raise prices</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230567/apple-watch-series-3-lte-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 3</a>, Apple has kept starting prices the same for the aluminum Apple Watch and we don’t expect a price hike this year. This means that the Series 11 will start at $399 and the larger version will cost $429, with an extra $100 for cellular capability and higher prices for various bands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Series 10, Apple also offered a titanium case for $699/$749, which includes LTE like the Ultra. Rumors suggest Apple will keep that option around with the Series 11, likely at the same price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, no discussion of future Apple product pricing is complete without mentioning U.S. tariffs, which are changing rapidly and could have a big impact on pricing. It’s simply too difficult to predict <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2772813/apple-admits-it-may-need-to-raise-prices-to-deal-with-tariffs.html\">whether tariffs will increase the Apple Watch’s price</a>, the odds are significant. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch Series 11: Design</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 Review 8\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Watch-Series-10_Review_8.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Apple Watch Series 11 is likely to look nearly identical to the Series 10.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors throughout 2024 told us to expect more <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2469560/what-happened-to-the-apple-watch-series-x.html\">significant changes to the Apple Watch design</a> last year, and then the Series 10 debuted and it looked like a very slightly flattened Series 9. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, there aren’t even any rumors of big design changes. Currently, all signs point to an Apple Watch that is identical in appearance to the Series 10, with the possible exception of new colors, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2747498/apple-is-planning-to-launch-an-irresistible-sky-blue-iphone-17-pro.html\">possibly sky blue</a> to match the MacBook Air and iPhone 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch SE 3: Release date, price and design</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Launch at September iPhone event: Tuesday September 9 (probable)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pre-order from September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On sale from September 19</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hasn’t updated the Apple Watch SE since 2022 and that update was an extremely minor one, bringing a new chip and crash detection with a lower price of $249. It was initially rumored that 2024 would bring a substantial update to the budget watch with a plastic redesign, but that didn’t happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reported that a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2458604/a-plastic-apple-watch-se-is-still-coming-next-year.html\">plastic SE redesign would arrive in 2025</a> alongside the Series 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a rumor in March claimed that the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2648118/the-apple-watch-se-might-not-have-a-future-in-plastics-after-all.html\">Apple Watch SE had run into production issues</a> and was in “serious jeopardy.” So Apple may need to switch to an aluminum design for the new SE or stick with the current model for another year.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"A watch face on an Apple Watch SE 2022\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Watch-SE-2022-review-1.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Apple Watch SE hasn’t been updated since 2022.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Henry Burrell / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><br />Apple Watch Ultra 3: Release date, price and design</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Launch at September iPhone event: Tuesday September 9 (probable)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pre-order from September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On sale from September 19</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We do expect that there will be an Apple Watch Ultra 3 in 2025. Rumors so far point to 5G and satellite texting capabilities, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The Apple Watch Ultra 2025 might also be slimmer. And yes, the display might be even larger. In addition to that you can expect all the features coming to the Apple Watch Series 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch 2025: Features coming to the Apple Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been working on incorporating a microLED display on the Apple Watch for several years, according to various leaks and rumors, but it’s not expected to debut on the Series 11 this year. Some think this display shift will come to Apple Watch Ultra first, but even that isn’t expected in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Health </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not expecting any new health sensors. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1520846/apple-watch-glucose-monitoring-exploratory-design-group-breakthrough.html\">blood glucose monitoring initiative</a> is still years from ending up in a watch, it seems, and while there have been rumors of high blood pressure monitoring, that’s apparently not <em>quite</em> ready to appear this year, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what will be new? You can bet on a new <strong>S11 SiP</strong> (system in package), offering somewhat better performance. Don’t expect a big boost in battery life, though—that has been a near constant 18 hours for nearly the entire lifespan of the watch.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://fm-idg-picky.s3.amazonaws.com/polly_images/1.721636.1564218628!imageUploader/1918886444_x_980.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Siri på Apple Watch\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple Intelligence and the new Siri could be one of the new features of watchOS 12 and the Apple Watch Series 11.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Michael Simon/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Intelligence </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is a key aspect of almost every new Apple product now, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646745/the-apple-watch-may-get-a-new-life-as-a-camera-equipped-ai-device.html\">rumors suggest</a> Apple is working on bringing some AI features to the Apple Watch. The actual AI models probably won’t be able to run on the watch; rather, the watch will gather data, the processing will be done on your iPhone, and then the watch will display results or notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the new AI features will likely debut as part of watchOS 12, but some might be kept as Series 11 exclusives in order to help differentiate the hardware. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5G and Satelite </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also rumored that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will support 5G cellular and satellite messaging, which could also come to the Series 11. Apple debuted a wireless chip in the iPhone 16e, but it’s not clear whether it’s small or efficient enough for the Apple Watch yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No changes? The Series 11 could just be a ‘Series 10s’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We criticized the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1338408/apple-watch-series-8-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 8</a> for being largely the same as the Series 7, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2114964/apple-watch-series-9-review.html\">Series 9</a> for being almost identical to the Series 8. This looks like it could be another one of those years, where there are only very minor changes to the Apple Watch that you won’t even notice in everyday use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn’t mean it’s a bad watch, or that Apple is in trouble. There is virtually no competition for the Apple Watch, and as long as Apple keeps pressing forward with watchOS software features, it’s likely to keep selling a lot of Apple Watches. But if you’re hoping for a major change to the Apple Watch hardware, you’ll probably have to wait another year or more.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d4e8dd4e874042cb4810ef98087dce8d081de4c9e269beba14373600a1315967","category":"Apple"}
