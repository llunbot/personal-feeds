The latter type of button detects pressure and emulates the press of a physical button via a haptic (or Taptic) engine which generates vibrations. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple may well have ordered the buttons in preparation for future production plans, but this does not necessarily mean that they are destined for use in this year's ‌iPhone 16‌ models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe earliest known prototypes of the ‌‌iPhone 16‌‌ were thought to include haptic power and volume buttons. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-haptic-button-overview/\">Project Bongo</a>, as it was known internally, was a redesign of the volume and power buttons on the ‌iPhone 15‌. However, it was scrapped in 2023 following unresolved technical issues, according to <em>MacRumors</em>' sources. After the cancelation of the Bongo project, Apple moved back to mechanical buttons for the ‌‌iPhone 16‌‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a result, most rumors suggest that ‌iPhone 16‌ models will have all-mechanical buttons, and this includes the rumored addition of a fourth button. According to <em>The Information</em>, Apple will add a new \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/\">Capture Button</a>\" to all ‌iPhone 16‌ models, but the button is expected to be mechanical rather than capacitive, and yet it will be able to respond to pressure and touch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe button will be used for taking photos and videos, and ‌iPhone‌ users will reportedly be able to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nToday's report claims the capacitive components will enter volume production in the third quarter of this year, which is unusually late in terms of Apple's typical initial ‌iPhone‌ production run, so the order may be for the ‌iPhone‌ 17 lineup rather than this year's upcoming models. That said, as we saw with the ‌‌iPhone 15‌‌ series, things can change fairly far into the process, so watch this space.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/udn-com/\">Economic Daily News</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-orders-capactive-butttons-iphone-16/\">Apple Orders Capacitive Button Components Allegedly for iPhone 16</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-orders-capacitive-button-components-allegedly-for-iphone-16.2424660/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d953ace164803a086fe023d38d610554f3861223cd9741aff2d92e5fdcaf87d2","category":"Apple"}
