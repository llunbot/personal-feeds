The images caused confusion for some users because the Midjourney v5 engine used to create them <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ai-imager-midjourney-v5-stuns-with-photorealistic-images-and-5-fingered-hands/\">generates such realistic-looking content</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, the Midjourney user behind the images—Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins—<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisstokelwalker/midjourney-ai-donald-trump-arrest-images-ban\">alleged to Buzzfeed News</a> that he was banned from Midjourney over the images. Buzzfeed also reported that Midjourney has banned the word “arrest” from being used in text prompts to generate images.</p>\n<p>Midjourney has not yet confirmed the ban. An Ars test indicates that prompts using Donald Trump’s name also seem to be blocked on the engine, generating instead an error message saying that the prompt was blocked because “it may conflict with our content policy.” We got the same error message when we used prompts including other Trump family names and all the presidents’ names. However, other celebrity names, like former NFL player Tom Brady, are still seemingly acceptable in prompts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925983#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925983&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca05efee9b4a4fff65ea6d6bf7ee78b5158a4198d2c03ce2b9390ac70fbbb125","category":"Tech"}
