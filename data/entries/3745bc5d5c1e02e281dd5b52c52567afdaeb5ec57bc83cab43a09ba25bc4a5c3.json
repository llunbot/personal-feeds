Well, the answer is no – the brand is ditching the mechanical side.</p>\n<p>New Dura-Ace is referred to as R9200 series, and it comes in just two flavours:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>R9270:</strong> Disc brake, electronic shifting</li>\n<li><strong>R9250:</strong> Rim brake, electronic shifting</li>\n</ul><p>R9270 is semi-wireless. The levers are wireless and powered by small coin cells, while the two derailleurs are wired directly into the central battery using new, thinner SD-300 wires.</p>\n<p>Wireless communication takes place between the levers and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a>, with the latter always ‘on’ and listening for signals. The main battery is claimed to last for around 1,000km of riding, while the coin cells in the levers should manage 1.5 to 2 years.</p>\n<p>With development of the new groupset focused primarily on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a>, the rim brake R9250 levers are not wireless.</p>\n<p>Despite this, there’s only one rear derailleur option for the groupset.</p>\n<p>This incorporates wireless connectivity for third-party devices, doing away with the additional EW-WU111 wireless adaptor R9100 series Di2 required.</p>\n<p>The R9250 rear derailleur can pair directly via Bluetooth with Shimano’s E-Tube app on a phone or tablet, for example, allowing for customisation of the groupset from the off.</p>\n<p>It also incorporates the charging port and mode switch that were previously situated in a separate junction box.</p>\n<h2>Faster, smoother shifting and lower gearing</h2>\n<p>According to Shimano, Dura-Ace R9200’s rear shifting is 58 per cent faster than R9100’s, while the front sees a 45 per cent gain.</p>\n<p>Shifting is said to be smoother, too. R9200 cassettes use ‘Hyperglide+’, a design debuted with Shimano’s top-spec <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupset</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-xtr-m9100-groupset-first-ride-review/\">XTR M9100</a>.</p>\n<p>This is claimed to offer “shockless” shifting, with no need to ease up on the pedals as you change gear.</p>\n<p>In the past, Dura-Ace has been quite narrowly focused on the needs of road racers, with hardcore gearing to match.</p>\n<p>Despite the move to 12-speed, Shimano hasn’t radically shaken up its gearing in the way SRAM did when it launched its eTap AXS groupsets (SRAM paired smaller chainrings with a 10-tooth cassette sprocket), but it has chosen to offer a more everyman choice of cassettes, with 11-28t, 11-30t and 11-34t options available.</p>\n<p>If big gears are your jam, the cranks are available in a 54/40t option, as well as standard compact (50/34t) and semi-compact (52/36t) versions.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at each component in turn…</p>\n<h2>Dura-Ace R9200 levers and satellite shifters</h2>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Pinarello-Dogma-F-with-Dura-Ace-R9200-9-0cd03f0.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The new lever design is the most noticeable change for this generation. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Pinarello-Dogma-F-with-Dura-Ace-R9200-10-db8056a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The shifting buttons are designed to be easier to differentiate from one another. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Pinarello-Dogma-F-with-Dura-Ace-R9200-8-038ceab.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The hoods now curve inwards slightly for better ergonomics. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nPerhaps the most visually arresting part of the new groupset, the ST-R9270 hydraulic lever bodies are slightly larger than those of R9100, and the lever bodies curve inwards slightly.\n<p>The front upper section above the lever pivot is fully enclosed, an aesthetic departure from previous years.</p>\n<p>Each lever is powered by a CR1632 coin cell, claimed to last around 1.5 to 2 years of riding. Riders can choose to run their levers wired if desired, which apparently has the side-effect of increasing battery life by around 50 per cent.</p>\n<p>The Di2 shift buttons are more offset than previously and are designed to be easier to differentiate from one another when you’re wearing gloves. There’s still a ‘hidden’, user-assignable button on top of each lever hood.</p>\n<p>Shimano says it’s reduced the amount of free stroke in the brake levers and they now benefit from Servo Wave, which makes the relationship between lever travel and pad travel non-linear.</p>\n<p>When you brake, the pads initially move together quickly, before slowing and trading speed for modulation and braking power.</p>\n<p>With the focus on the disc groupset, the Dura-Ace R9250 rim brake levers appear virtually unchanged compared to R9150, aside from subtly different texturing to the hoods and the move to skinnier wiring.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Our test bike came fitted with climbing shifters on the tops of the bar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As with the previous generation, optional sprint shifters (SW-R801) and climbing shifters (SW-R801-T) can be added to suit rider needs.</p>\n<p>Shimano is also offering time-trial-specific shifters updated for the new SD-300 wiring, although these still carry an R9100 series model designation (ST-R9180).</p>\n<ul><li><strong>R9270 levers claimed weight:</strong> 350g (+20g vs. R9170)</li>\n</ul><h2>Dura-Ace R9200 rear derailleur</h2>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Pinarello-Dogma-F-with-Dura-Ace-R9200-5-963aa4f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The rear derailleur takes care of wireless communication with the levers.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Pinarello-Dogma-F-with-Dura-Ace-R9200-14-b323085.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The charging port has been relocated to the rear derailleur. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Pinarello-Dogma-F-with-Dura-Ace-R9200-15-37a9bd7.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>An indicator LED imparts useful information during maintenance and mode selection. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThere’s only one version of the new RD-R9250 rear derailleur and it’s designed to accommodate all the cassettes on offer, up to a maximum 34-tooth large sprocket.

While the bigger gains are supposed to be at the rear, it’s the front shifting that really impresses.</p>\n<p>The way the front derailleur fires the chain from small ring to big is delightful. R9100-series Di2 was already phenomenally competent, and R9200 is just that little bit better.</p>\n<p>In normal riding, the shifting seems to be impossible to fluster. You can crash through gears if you’re an absolute savage about dumping multiple gears at very low cadence, but by and large, the groupset lives up to its claimed ability to shift under hard pedalling loads.</p>\n<p>Like previous-generation Di2, there’s the option to run synchronised shifting (where the system takes care of front shifting) or semi-synchronised shifting (where the system shifts the rear a couple of sprockets to compensate for front shifts and give a more natural gear progression), and you can easily switch between modes on the fly.</p>\n<p>While many riders will still prefer to keep things fully manual, the overall improvements to the shift make these options much more appealing – I’ve found I quite like the semi-synchro mode for general riding.</p>\n<p>R9200’s disc brakes are outstanding too, with minimal wasted lever travel, loads of power and great modulation.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> New Dura-Ace is quite conservative in its design but works brilliantly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Max Wilman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>My Pinarello Dogma F test bike came directly from Shimano’s European press camp and so its brakes were set up right-rear (the opposite to a standard UK arrangement), and I had to make a very conscious effort to be restrained because there’s so much stopping power available at your fingertips.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t sure I’d like the new, larger hoods as the old ones were delightfully svelte, but in use they’re very comfortable and don’t feel overly bulbous.</p>\n<p>The test bike was set up with climbing shifters on the bar tops. I like these a lot in principle, but the rear-facing buttons didn’t seem ideally placed for my thumbs, and shifting with the heels of my hands was actually easier. I’d choose to point the buttons forwards and operate them with my fingers instead.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h3>BikeRadar’s take: Dura-Ace R9200 isn’t radical or surprising, but early signs are very promising</h3>\n<p>Much teased and occasionally leaked, Dura-Ace R9200 has been a long time coming. </p>\n<p>In some ways it’s almost an anti-climax – the new groupset ticks a whole lot of boxes and includes the kind of refinements we’ve come to expect from Shimano product launches, but doesn’t do much that’s genuinely surprising. </p>\n<p>We expected it to be at least partly wireless, and it is. We were sure it would be 12-speed, and it is. </p>\n<p>Perhaps the one real surprise is the freehub design. With Micro Spline already established as a standard, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that Shimano would adopt it for the road too, but it hasn’t. </p>\n<p>This is good news if you want to upgrade your groupset but keep your existing wheels. While there is a new freehub spline pattern, the new cassettes are backwards compatible with existing 11-speed freehubs.</p>\n<p>That mechanical Dura-Ace is no more will be a blow to purists, and I can’t help feeling a little wistful. </p>\n<p>The reality is that there’s no demand for mechanical from the pros who race on Dura-Ace, and it’s certainly waning on the consumer side too. </p>\n<p>Keeping it as an option would be more about prestige than good business sense and, aside from adding an extra sprocket, it’s hard to see how Shimano could have meaningfully improved on R9100 mechanical’s shifting. </p>\n<p>My experience so far suggests R9200 is a fantastic groupset.
