Woodring believes this increase is driven in part by new MacBooks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his newsletter last month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/gurman-15-inch-macbook-air-wwdc/\">unveil the long-rumored 15-inch MacBook Air at WWDC next month</a>:<blockquote>As part of watchOS 10, the company is planning to bring back widgets and make them a central part of the interface. This new strategy will debut at WWDC in June, alongside the unveiling of iOS 17, macOS 14, the 15-inch MacBook Air, and, of course, the much-anticipated mixed-reality headset.</blockquote>The first-generation 15-inch MacBook Air will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/kuo-15-inch-macbook-air-two-m2-chip-options/\">powered by the M2 chip</a>, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. No external design changes have been rumored for the laptop beyond the larger display size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest 13-inch MacBook Air <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-m2-macbook-air/\">debuted at WWDC last year</a> and features the M2 chip, a 1080p camera, a MagSafe 3 charging port, two Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, and a Force Touch trackpad. Pricing starts at $1,199, and color options include Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if any other MacBooks will be unveiled next month, as new 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip are not expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/kuo-m3-chip-second-half-of-2023/\">until later this year or next year</a>, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro were updated with the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips just three months ago.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWWDC begins with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">Apple's keynote on June 5</a> and runs through June 9.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/15-inch-macbook-air/\">15-Inch MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/21/new-macbooks-morgan-stanley/\">MacBook Supplier Ramping Up Production as 15-Inch MacBook Air Rumored to Launch at WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-supplier-ramping-up-production-as-15-inch-macbook-air-rumored-to-launch-at-wwdc.2390108/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9415ce43fc608193ee791671cf272e7cf12f9040700eedda3dcc932c7d6b2a6d","category":"Apple"}
