The computer is a petite 5-inch beige square with elements of the original Macintosh, including a black rectangle to mimic a screen (with an embossed logo that looks suspiciously like the Finder), a magnetic rainbow logo, and a disk drive cutout that has a small light to indicate power. There are vents on the back and sides, and more ports than the original Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its intro video, Ayaneo leans heavily into the Mac inspiration, with a Hello screen like the original Mac and a spec slide similar to the ones Apple uses in its keynotes. You can customize that mini PC with magnets and stickers, though none of them seem to be Mac-orientated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s designed to sit with the Mac side facing up, but there’s no reason why it shouldn’t work standing upright and has the following specs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Up to AMD Ryzen 3 3200U or 7 5700U </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Up to 32GB DDR4 dual-channel memory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Up to 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C (1), USB-A (3), HDMI, DisplayPort</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the Ayaneo Mini PC runs Windows 11 Home Edition, but we’re sure some intrepid developer can get it to boot into macOS. While technically an Indiegogo campaign, the Retro Mini PC is ready to ship this month. It starts at $149.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2b7c8cdbc42fb5dcf6fdfdaea77e2be4dbf50d9f608d781cd1780c0ad3d450f5","category":"Apple"}
