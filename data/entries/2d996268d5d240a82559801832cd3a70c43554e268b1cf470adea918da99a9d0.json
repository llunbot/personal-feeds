Apple also remains completely silent about whether or not it still plans to launch the system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are still a few signs of hope.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFirst, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/07/apple-prepping-next-gen-carplay/\"><em>9to5Mac</em> recently reported</a> that additional references to next-generation CarPlay were added in iOS 18.3 beta 2's code. Second, <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris today uncovered some additional <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1879159569882190069\">next-generation CarPlay images</a> that were filed in a EU database last month. Apple previously showed that next-generation CarPlay will feature customizable widgets, and the images provide a closer look at the widget selection screens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Here is an upcoming look at widgets coming to CarPlay 2.0 <a href=\"https://t.co/2mwg3VjR7H\">pic.twitter.com/2mwg3VjR7H</a></p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1879159569882190069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nDue to Apple's reluctance to comment on future plans, we do not know if next-generation CarPlay is still happening. Hopefully, Apple will finally provide an update about next-generation CarPlay soon to set the record straight.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first previewed next-generation CarPlay at WWDC 2022, more than two and a half years ago. For now, the wait continues.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/next-generation-carplay-status-update/\">Here's the Latest on Next-Generation CarPlay After Missed 2024 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-the-latest-on-next-generation-carplay-after-missed-2024-launch.2447376/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2d996268d5d240a82559801832cd3a70c43554e268b1cf470adea918da99a9d0","category":"Apple"}
