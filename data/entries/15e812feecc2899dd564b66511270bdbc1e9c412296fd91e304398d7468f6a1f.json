According to rumors, iOS 19 will be the biggest change since iOS 7 in terms of design, this time featuring a new interface reportedly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362200/visionos-2-photos-mac-virtual-display-home-screen-gestures.html\">visionOS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still remember the feeling of using iOS 7 for the first time on my iPhone 5, and it was like I was using a completely different phone. There was a lot to like and dislike, and even after all these years, I still miss aspects of iOS 6. With that in mind, I decided to revisit iOS 6 to see how much had changed from one version to the next—and what we can learn about the next dramatic shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Back to iOS 6: A different world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/218083/ios_6_what_you_need_to_know.html\">iOS 6</a> was announced in 2011, and although it wasn’t a huge update compared to the one that would follow, it was still quite controversial at the time. Most notably, Apple replaced Google Maps with its own Maps app with iOS 6, which brought significant interface changes, along with missing features and some major issues with locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, iOS 6 is no longer supported by Apple, and there’s no official way to run it on iPhones and iPads. However, if you still have an old device that was once compatible with iOS 6, you can downgrade your iPhone or iPad (although there are many things that no longer work on this version, including the aforementioned Maps).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 6 Lock Screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Lock-Screen.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>iOS 6 was a simpler time—with slide to unlock.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, my journey revisiting iOS 6 started with seeing the old Apple logo with a reflection effect on boot, followed by the old Setup screen. That alone brought back a lot of good memories. It’s hard to forget the linen-inspired background that was present in Setup, Notification Center, and even Siri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667036/ios-7-review-updated-for-ios-7-1-1.html\">iOS 7</a> and the versions that came after focused on making everything overly minimalist and modern, the old iOS interface was much more detailed with faux textures that resembled real-life objects (known as skeuomorphism): leather, wood, linen, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the Lock Screen had no widgets or animated wallpapers, and Face ID wasn’t a thing. Instead, users had to “Slide to Unlock,” a fun way to make first-time iPhone users familiar with multi-touch gestures. There was also a sound effect of a padlock being unlocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most remarkable feature of iOS 6 is the first thing you see when you unlock your iPhone: the Home Screen. The 3D design of the icons pops out of the screen when you see them on a device with a Retina display. This, combined with the bolder text, gives the impression that you’re looking at a printed page rather than pixels on a screen. Even the wallpapers, especially the water droplets, were visually enticing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The icons had much more personality, too. The Camera app icon resembled the rear sensor of the first iPhone rather than a generic camera, while apps like Passbook (former Wallet) and Contacts had a nice leather texture. This personality was also carried into each app’s interface as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Notes app looked like a real-life notepad with yellow paper pages, and there’s a nice subtle detail at the top to simulate torn pages. Special attention was also paid to the system’s animations. If you created a new note, you would see an animation as if you had turned a page on a real-life notebook.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 6 Passbook\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Passbook.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>iOS 6’s skeuomorphism was a nod to the real-world devices it was mimicking.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In Passbook, there was an impressive animation for deleting tickets, which simulated paper being shredded. Voice Memos also looked cool on iOS 6, with the large metal microphone and a VU meter that reacts when you speak or tap the microphone. The volume indicator shines as you move the iPhone in your hand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there’s Siri. This was my favorite version of the Siri interface, mostly because of its shiny microphone button with the glowing purple light that pulsed as you spoke. It felt so futuristic yet real, like you were actually interacting with a physical object.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 6 was the culmination of five years of Apple interface design and everything felt more fun and alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 7 arrived in 2013, marking the first major iOS redesign. Skeuomorphism gave way to a simpler interface with solid backgrounds and no textures. Stylized buttons were replaced by text, and beautifully designed icons were replaced by flat shapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 7: Modern but dull</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a dramatic, even shocking change. On the one hand, iOS 7 looked a lot more modern than iOS 6. But on the other hand, fun interface elements also became more boring. In iOS 7, the Notes app was just a white screen where you write text, and the same applied to the vast majority of iPhone and iPad apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also lost many of the skeuomorphic animations that, while not necessary, were a nice touch and always brought a smile to my face every time I saw them. With the change, iOS lost its personality and character.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 6 notes app\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-notes-app.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>iOS 7 removed much of a originality of iOS.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I believe that iOS 7 marked the beginning of a new era for Apple. It set out a modern aesthetic that would be followed not only by Apple in its forthcoming products, but also by other companies. Can you imagine a product like the Apple Watch running something like iOS 6?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, the personality that iOS had faded over time as the interface became flatter and, well, duller.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 19: Lessons from the past</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I have returned to iOS 18, it’s hard not to look at Apple’s current OS without thinking of the rumored redesign. Although it’s unclear whether the iOS 19 redesign will be as significant as iOS 7 was, seeing iOS 6 again made me realize that Apple can learn a few things from its past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 6’s skeuomorphic interface might not fit in with current standards, but I’d love to see some aspects of skeuomorphism make a comeback on iOS. Things like the reflection effect that moves as you tilt your phone, and fun animations would definitely go a long way toward making iOS more fun and unique again.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 6 Siri\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iOS-6-Siri.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Siri has gone through numerous changes over the years—will iOS 19 bring another one?</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Apple seems to be flirting with depth and realism again — just look at macOS Big Sur icons or the translucent glass effects in visionOS. Bringing back more shadows and depth throughout the system wouldn’t hurt, especially when it comes to icons. I love Mac app icons because they have a nice balance of modern and skeuomorphic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And please, Apple. Give us some cool wallpapers again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could Apple surprise us by looking back to move forward? Back when Apple launched iOS 7, it was about pushing the iPhone into a modern era that would last for more than a decade. This year’s change is reportedly about consistency, and reports say the new design will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2794967/report-wwdc-interface-overhaul-will-be-more-widely-felt-than-ios-7.html\">extend to all devices</a>, not just the iPhone. With that in mind, Apple has an opportunity to set a new path, not just iOS, but for all of its OSes, that fuses form with functionality—and a little fun. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"15e812feecc2899dd564b66511270bdbc1e9c412296fd91e304398d7468f6a1f","category":"Apple"}
