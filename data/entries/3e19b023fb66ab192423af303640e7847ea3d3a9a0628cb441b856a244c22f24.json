Its design revolves around the simple idea that you can transition between road and off-road and still ride fast while relying on a geometry that is both efficient and comfortable.</p>\n<p>A performance tube set that feels lively and eager, not over-built. A custom-formed and shaped rear triangle for maximum comfort. A lightweight and confidence-inspiring carbon fork with cage mounts, rando rack compatibility, and internally sleeved dynamo routing.</p>\n<p>Huge tire clearance, maxing out at 53 mm with a 700 wheel or 62 mm on a 650 wheel. The frame features ports for dynamo rear lighting, with clever solutions for every type of configuration, representing a level of care and detailing that you would normally only see in the custom world.</p>\n<p>Modular design solutions across the frameset future-proof your investment.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan3-Geomtry.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan3-Geomtry.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan3-Geomtry.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan3-Geomtry.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Burnt-Orange.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Burnt-Orange.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Burnt-Orange.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Burnt-Orange.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Pearlescent-B.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Pearlescent-B.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Pearlescent-B.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Pearlescent-B.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Plum-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Plum-15.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Plum-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Plum-15.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>NEW updates for the Secan 3.0:</h3>\n<p>New chain stays and seat stays. Using technology first introduced on the Strael 3.0, we have heavily curved and flattened the stays to maximize compliance. Unique to Fairlight. Post-forming heat treatment adds strength.</p>\n<p>Increased tyre clearance. Now compatible with up to 700 x 53mm and up to 62mm in 650B/27.5”.</p>\n<p>Fairlight x Bentley Mk3 dropouts featuring a removable cable stop – so whether you are using mechanical, Di2 or AXS gearing, the frame looks like it was designed specifically for the groupset. Direct mount, standard hanger and T-Type inserts. The disc side insert is now 160/180mm.</p>\n<p>New Cempa 3.0 fork. 160/180mm brake mount. The fork is now rando rack compatible and we have designed a load bearing machined aluminium insert that is bonded into the crown. The fork layup has been updated to provide 10% more compliance vs the Cempa 2.0. The side cage mounts have been raised by 0.5mm to provide a raised surface for cages and rack legs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-19.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-19.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-Top-Tu.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-Top-Tu.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-Top-Tu.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Secan-3.0-Frameset-Desert-Top-Tu.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The downtube brake hose clips are now CNC-machined modular parts. Designed in-house; as elegant and light as we could possibly make them. Featuring a beveled cut-out which matches the new cut-out details on the disc side dropout washer.<br />\nDropper post compatible for 1x set-ups. We do a double-hose version of our new CNC downtube clips. There is a dropper exit port on the back of the seat tube.</p>\n<p>New 3D printed downtube cable guide – available in 1x and 2x versions. The brake hose now routes through the part for a more elegant aesthetic.</p>\n<p>All new 3D-printed bottom bracket cable guide for mechanical gear set-ups. We have made one part do several jobs; as well as guiding the front and rear derailleur cables, it also acts as a guide for the brake hose, dropper post hose and the dynamo rear light wire. Ultra utility – everything in its place.</p>\n<p>Specific 3D printed bottom bracket guide for Di2 and AXS set-ups. Guides the brake hose, dropper post hose and dynamo rear light wire.</p>\n<p>Geometry – Small refinements. The chain stay length has increased by 2mm (430mm to 432mm) to add space for the larger 700c tyres. Head angles have slackened by 0.5-0.75 degrees – in line with the larger tyres, but still very much at the conservative end of the gravel sector. Stack and Reach remain largely unchanged.</p>\n<p>New data engineered top tube pattern. Inspired by mid-century poster art; contemporary and graphical. Seamless design that is designed to look different from every viewing angle. As interesting underneath the top tube as it is on top.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://fairlightcycles.com/secan-3-0/\" target=\"_blank\">Fairlight Cycles</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/fairlight-cycles-secan-3/\">Fairlight Cycles Secan 3: When All-Road Becomes All-Rounder</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"3e19b023fb66ab192423af303640e7847ea3d3a9a0628cb441b856a244c22f24","category":"Cycling"}
