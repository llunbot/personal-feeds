He didn’t know what he’d find but he knew what he was looking for – the makers and the stories behind the world’s most particular cycling culture: Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Japanese cycling culture\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Yoshiaki Nagasawa at work in his studio on the outskirts of Osaka.</figcaption><figcaption>Bartosz Hołoszkiewicz</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Nagasawa</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Framebuilder, Osaka</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow everyone I talked to seemed to have a connection to Yoshiaki Nagasawa. These other companies are third, fourth-generation family businesses, and they’d say, ‘Our grandfather was friends with Nagasawa.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s how I got in touch with him, actually. I was trying but had no luck, then the president of Kashimax saddles, Eijiro Kashima, said he knew a local bike courier who was visiting Nagasawa with this guy from Finland who’s a framebuilder. So Kashima got in touch and asked if I could come too, and gave the guy my number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was around 3pm and I had drunk a few beers over lunch, so when I got back to my AirBnB I fell asleep. I was woken up by a message at 6.30pm and it’s the guy saying we’re going tonight, and can I be at this place at this time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get picked up by these guys I’ve never met and we arrive at 8pm, which seems really late but it turns out this is the time Nagasawa starts work. He likes the evenings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He doesn’t speak English at all, of course, but he showed us round and was this wonderful gentleman, always with a cigarette, showing the Finnish framebuilder how he makes his stuff, super-open about it all. It was really fun.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Japanese cycling culture\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Comparing his frame designs (Nagasawa’s clipboard) to that of a visiting Finnish framebuilder (the phone).</figcaption><figcaption>Bartosz Hołoszkiewicz</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Nagasawa is a legendary framebuilder; he was taught to build frames by Ugo De Rosa in Italy in the 1970s and then built bikes for the track racer Koichi Nakano, who is like the Japanese Eddy Merckx. He has a huge reputation and still builds frames for racers and regular riders today, but he’s pretty elusive, so to meet him was amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nitto</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Component manufacturer, Fukushima</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nitto is over 100 years old now, founded in 1923, but unlike European brands there isn’t this romantic vibe about it. There is a traditional artisan crafts scene in Japan but the reality is it’s much more functional and the true value isn’t so much in the products but in the labour and toil, which the Japanese call <em>monozukuri</em> – literally to ‘make’ (zukuri) ‘things’ (mono). Even in an office, the customary exchange between workers at the end of the day is <em>gokurosama</em>, meaning ‘thank you for your effort’. <em>Monozukuri</em> is a kind of spirit of work ethic.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So at Nitto the employees need to appreciate cycling, but it’s not a passion project like an Italian manufacturer might have you believe their business is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nitto was started in Tokyo by the current owner’s grandmother and it made motorbike equipment first.

Touring on steel bikes is popular in Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visit itself ended up being like this official state visit. I reached out to Nitto by email, then at some point Genichi Yamada from the Japanese Bicycle Promotion Institute got involved along with a professor from Keio University. It was all very formal.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Japanese cycling culture\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture05.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Kashimax makes a huge number of colourways, albeit they’re based around a handful of models.</figcaption><figcaption>Bartosz Hołoszkiewicz</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Kashimax</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Saddle manufacturer, Osaka</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kashimax saddles are so old school – just a plastic moulded base with fabric stretched over it, still the same saddles as they’ve ever made. It’s really interesting that the company can continue in this way in the face of modern saddles, but they have a cult following.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve done collaborations with Paul Smith and they used to be big in the BMX scene in the 1980s and 1990s – they make the saddle with the handle cut out to carry your BMX by – but mostly it’s now keirin that sustains them. The company got into that in 1979 thanks to the current owner’s father being friends with Nagasawa, who was the mechanic for a famous keirin rider.

Both types are derny-paced races, where the pacer leaves the track and the riders sprint to win, but the tactics and the formalities surrounding the race are different. In Japan, the riders come on and bow to the crowd and referees, for example; they dress in colours like jockeys and the equipment has to be certified by the Japan Keirin Association, so everyone rides the same type of steel bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JIK is basically a school where you go learn to be a professional. A lot of people go there when they’ve finished in one sport, like you wrap up a career in baseball and take up keirin. But JIK is not just about riding a bike; it’s like a degree. The students have to learn about everything around the sport, studying and training for 15 hours a day for a year.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Japanese cycling culture\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture10.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Bartosz Hołoszkiewicz</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The JIK facility is huge, like nothing I’ve ever seen before. It has a couple of velodromes, then the Olympic velodrome a few minutes away, gyms, workshops, classrooms, dining rooms…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graduates go on to compete, but it’s not so much about being the best as it is about earning a solid living – there’s good money in keirin because it’s everywhere, every day in Japan. Keirin functions like horseracing in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the biggest difference with keirin here – it exists for gambling. That’s how it started. The Japanese government designed a sport that could be performed cheaply and could be bet on to stimulate the economy after World War Two.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Japanese cycling culture\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture12.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Bartosz Hołoszkiewicz</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Shimano</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>‘A place for encounters’, Osaka</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a meeting with Shimano at its factory but they wouldn’t let me see the actual factory – we just sat in the conference room, so I was a bit disappointed.

It’s in a place called ‘Knowledge Capital’ inside a typical Japanese mall – huge, sort of modern in a dated way, and super-neat. Shimano Square is more like a cafe and a museum than a shop; you can’t buy any Shimano components here. They have a fleet of city bikes and the idea is more one of education, that the Square will share and encourage an active lifestyle of cycling and also fishing – Shimano’s other pursuit. They organise trips where you meet at the shop, get a bike and ride off to explore a new neighbourhood for an hour.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Japanese cycling culture\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/japanese-cycling-culture11.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>A wall of Shimano groupsets from down the ages at Shimano Square in Osaka.

The drive, like all the businesses here, is to make something expertly, with this very specific commitment to quality. Yonex is the only big Japanese brand that makes carbon fibre bikes, and they’re only sold in Japan. They won’t ship them anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They only make about 150 frames a year, but they do everything in-house – the design, the moulds, the layup, the painting – so I was shown through the whole process. Yonex makes a disc brake frame that weighs 540g and costs around £4,000. You’ll have to factor in the flights to get it, though, plus the waiting time after you order it. But I’d take any excuse to get to spend more time in Japan.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'tasty morsels sent straight to your inbox, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/japan-cycling\">Made in Japan: Inside the world’s most particular cycling culture</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5b0757da2ac1e113a7d0ced5cef131ad4c13eaaf2608c57551bb5423bc5f53d9","category":"Cycling"}
