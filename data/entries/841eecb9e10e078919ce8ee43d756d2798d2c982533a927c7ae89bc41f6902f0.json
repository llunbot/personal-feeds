Nine sets of these exclusive wheels featuring the iconic Qhubeka logo around the rim are to be sold during the final day of the Tour, with all sale proceeds going to the South African charity. A tenth set will be given away to one lucky winner for signing up to HUNT’s Journal.\r\n\r\nThe limited edition wheels being sold will be ridden by Team Qhubeka NextHash on the final stage into Paris on Sunday 18th July, offering riders a unique opportunity to purchase Tour-used equipment and, in doing so, help change lives. These limited edition wheels are now available to purchase over at <a href=\"https://www.huntbikewheels.com/pages/limited-edition-qhubeka-x-hunt-54-aerodynamicist-carbon-disc-wheelsets\" target=\"_blank\">huntbikewheels.com</a>\r\n\r\nHUNT Co-Founder Tom Marchment said of the collaboration, <em>“HUNT was drawn to Team Qhubeka NextHash not only for their incredible level of performance and professionalism, but also the work they do in supporting the Qhubeka charity’s mission to change lives through bicycles. This project was a small way for HUNT to help further that mission by directly supporting and promoting the Qhubeka charity, while offering riders the very unique opportunity to own wheels used by pros in the 2021 Tour de France.”</em>\r\n\r\nTeam Qhubeka NextHash will showcase the limited edition wheels at the Tour de France on Mandela Day – the annual international day of celebration in honour of Nelson Mandela on the day of his birthday. Mandela Day is celebrated annually by Team Qhubeka NextHash with 2021 being no different.\r\n\r\nAnthony Fitzhenry, Founder of Qhubeka, added: <em>“We are very pleased that Hunt Wheels have decided to activate the #QHandUp campaign of Team Qhubeka NextHash with these very special wheelsets at the Tour de France. Their partnership with the team is based on shared values and this collaboration is evidence of that. The funds raised through the auction of these wheels will help fund bicycles for people who need them. We appreciate the support from the team and the team partners.”</em>\r\n\r\nHUNT stepped in to partner Team Qhubeka NextHash at the end of last season, seeing the Sussex wheel brand’s first entry into the WorldTour, one which has already seen wheels winning at the highest level. The team, Africa’s first and only UCI WorldTour outfit, won three stages of the recent Giro d’Italia on three different sets of wheels, the first coming on a pair of HUNT’s hugely popular 50 Carbon Aero Disc.<h2>Key Details</h2><ul><li>HUNT are launching a special run of 10x Qhubeka limited edition wheels, to be used on Mandela Day on the final stage of this year’s Tour</li><li>Riders can purchase wheels actually ridden on the final stage of the 2021 Tour de France, for (£1089 / €1409 / $1549)</li><li>All proceeds will be donated to the Qhubeka Foundation to help change lives through bicycles</li><li>9x pairs are to be sold, with 1x being given to a lucky winner for signing up to the HUNT Journal</li></ul><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210712_Hunt-Wheels-Screenshots-5.jpg\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hunt-Bike-Wheels-2420-2.jpg\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210712_Hunt-Wheels-Screenshots-11.jpg\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hunt-Bike-Wheels-2419.jpg\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210712_Hunt-Wheels-Screenshots-2.jpg\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/limited-edition-qhubeka-x-hunt-wheelset/\">Read More</a>","author":"HUNT Road","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"841eecb9e10e078919ce8ee43d756d2798d2c982533a927c7ae89bc41f6902f0","category":"Cycling"}
