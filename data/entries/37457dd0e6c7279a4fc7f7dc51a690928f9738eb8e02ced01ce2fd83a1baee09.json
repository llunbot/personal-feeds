{"title":"Windows Recall Feature for Copilot+ PCs Will Return, in Beta, in October","link":"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/","date":1724267594000,"content":"\n<p>Microsoft:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With a commitment to delivering a trustworthy and secure Recall (preview) experience on Copilot+ PCs for customers, we‚Äôre sharing an update that Recall will be available to Windows Insiders starting in October. As previously shared on June 13, we have adjusted our release approach to leverage the valuable expertise of our Windows Insider community prior to making Recall available for all Copilot+ PCs. Security continues to be our top priority and when Recall is available for Windows Insiders in October we will publish a blog with more details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For years I stubbornly held onto the full word <em>weblog</em>, but eventually <em>blog</em> won out. But that‚Äôs talking about a blog as a publication, a site. It will never sound anything but idiotic to me to call a blog post a ‚Äúblog‚Äù. It makes no sense. You write blogs on a blog?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, would be scary to consider what this Recall feature would have been like if security were not, as Microsoft repeats <em>ad nauseum</em>, the company‚Äôs top priority. The initial version [was such privacy Swiss cheese][üßÄ] that it‚Äôs enough to make you think Microsoft is full of shit that security is their top priority.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/21/windows-recall-october\">¬†‚òÖ¬†</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"37457dd0e6c7279a4fc7f7dc51a690928f9738eb8e02ced01ce2fd83a1baee09","category":"Tech"}
