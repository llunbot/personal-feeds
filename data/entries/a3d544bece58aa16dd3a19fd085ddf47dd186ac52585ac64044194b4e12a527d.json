Turning the Digital Crown achieves the same thing. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMany stock apps have been entirely revamped with a simpler, information-forward design. Weather, for example, shows the temperature and conditions of your current location, with a quick scroll offering an hourly forecast so you no longer have to tap to get more information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also added two new watch faces, Palette and Snoopy, and there are updates to Cycling and Hiking workouts, along with mental health integrations to support new health features in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>. Users can log their state of mind and mood using the Apple Watch, with the device providing insights into mental health over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌watchOS 10‌ also adds support for Apple's forthcoming NameDrop feature in ‌iOS 17‌. Rather than type in the number of someone new to call or text them so that they have your number, NameDrop allows you to simply hold your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> near their ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ to swap contact details. NameDrop works between two iPhones‌, and between an ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and an Apple Watch. The feature also works between two Apple Watches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nElsewhere, in Apple Fitness+, a new Custom Plans feature allows users to tailor workout routines by selecting day, duration, workout type, music, and trainer. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple yesterday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-watchos-10-rc/\">seeded</a> the release candidate version of the upcoming update to developers for testing purposes. The release candidate, or RC, represents the final version of the software that will be released to the public, barring the last-minute discovery of any show-stopping bugs.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/apple-watchos-10-release-date-september-18/\">Apple to Release watchOS 10 on Monday, September 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-release-watchos-10-on-monday-september-18.2401505/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3d544bece58aa16dd3a19fd085ddf47dd186ac52585ac64044194b4e12a527d","category":"Apple"}
