{"title":"Nintendo patent explains Switch 2 Joy-Cons’ “mouse operation” mode","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2075022","date":null,"content":"<p>It's been a month now since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/switch-2-leaks-point-to-controllers-that-work-like-computer-mice/\">we first heard rumors</a> that the Switch 2's new Joy-Cons could be slid across a flat surface to function like a computer mouse. Now, a newly published patent filed by Nintendo seems to confirm that use case and describe in some detail how it will work.</p>\n<p>The international patent was filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization back in in January of 2023, but <a href=\"https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803\">only published on WIPO's web site Thursday</a>. The Japanese-language patent—whose illustrations match what we've seen of Switch 2 Joy-Con precisely—features an English abstract describing \"a sensor for mouse operation\" which can \"detect reflected light from a detected surface, the light changing by moving over the detected surface...\" much like any number of optical computer mice. Schematic drawings in the patent show how the light source and light sensor are squeezed inside the Joy-Con, with a built-in lens for directing the light to and from each.</p>\n<p>A machine translation of the full text of the patent describes the controller as \"a novel input device that can be used as a mouse and other than a mouse.\" In mouse mode, as described in the patent, the user cradles the outer edge of the controller with their palm and places the inner edge \"on, for example, a desk or the like.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2075022\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2075022#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f52c96e30b981633f5776da2b543dd89eb4c56d1210891b3b5798235a5e6620a","category":"Tech"}
