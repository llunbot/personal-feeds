He has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/macbook-pro-not-getting-oled-until-2026/\">shared this timeframe previously</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to current MacBook Pro models with LCD screens, benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs widely rumored, Young reiterated that the next-generation iPad Pro models launching in 2024 will also be equipped with OLED displays. The first iPad Air and iPad mini models with OLED displays are not expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/oled-ipad-mini-and-ipad-air-2026/\">until 2026</a>; accordingly, Young confirmed that these devices will remain equipped with LCD screens next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung has been a dependable source of display-related information for future Apple products for several years, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">highly-accurate track record</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/macbook-pro-oled-three-years-away/\">MacBook Pro With OLED Display Likely Still at Least Three Years Away</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-with-oled-display-likely-still-at-least-three-years-away.2407237/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6fd476335b305b0e0ad8448430e6470a3c4a7dcfeba9410a2c2b176c2165b094","category":"Apple"}
