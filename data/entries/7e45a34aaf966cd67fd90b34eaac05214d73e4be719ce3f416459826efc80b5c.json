Every couple of hours, he would wet the house down,\ntop-to-bottom, and everything surrounding it. I don’t remember\neverybody doing this, but my Dad is a Meteorologist, and back then\nhe worked at the <a href=\"http://www.aqmd.gov/\">SCAQMD</a>, the regional agency charged with\nstudying, regulating, and improving air quality in Los Angeles,\nOrange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Because of his\nspecific remit and where we lived, he had a deep understanding of\nthe Santa Ana winds and their effect on the Palisades.</p>\n\n<p>When my dad explained what he was doing, he would point northeast\nto the hills behind us and tell us that if the winds didn’t die\ndown, the fire miles in the distance would come towards our tiny\nlittle house and there would be trouble. As a small child, I don’t\nactually remember being scared about any of this. Every year there\nwas a fire, the smoke was always so far away and so barely visible\nthat it just seemed like anything else in life at the time. And\nbesides, dads are superheroes to their children, so of course\nthere was no danger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a remarkable piece of writing this is. Part memoir, part call to action, entirely engaging.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/47-years-later-the-palisades-disappeared-overnight\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e45a34aaf966cd67fd90b34eaac05214d73e4be719ce3f416459826efc80b5c","category":"Tech"}
