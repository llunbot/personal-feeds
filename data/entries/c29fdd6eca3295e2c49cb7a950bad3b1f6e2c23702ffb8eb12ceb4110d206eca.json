[...] </p>\n\n<p>In a clip of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoHXyqiPntM\">first-round highlights</a> from the 2024 NBA \nSlam Dunk Contest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lujahehe\">tipped by</a> @lujahehe on X, an unusual \ncamera is displayed next to the judges. The camera isn’t \nmentioned or used at all during the broadcast nor particularly \nhighlighted by the camera, but it happens to appear fairly \nprominently in the frame. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems very likely that is a stereoscopic camera, but I wouldn’t assume that’s it’s specifically Apple’s. Could just as well be the NBA’s. But if I had to bet, I’d bet it was Apple’s, or is part of an exclusive deal between Apple and the NBA.</p>\n\n<p>And surely, they had cameras in other locations too. Watching the dunk contest from right behind the backboard must be astonishing.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/19/nba-apple-3d\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c29fdd6eca3295e2c49cb7a950bad3b1f6e2c23702ffb8eb12ceb4110d206eca","category":"Tech"}
