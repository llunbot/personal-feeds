As previously reported, Apple is also said to have held similar discussions <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/\">with Google and OpenAI</a>, the company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nIf these partnerships move forward, it is likely that Baidu would power some of Apple's generative AI features in China, while other companies like Google or OpenAI would serve as partners in the U.S. and other countries.
