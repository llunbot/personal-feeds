But whenever I set up a new Mac, I’m happy to download and install <a href=\"https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/\">Rocket</a>—the first app I install on any new Mac. In fact, it’s one of the utilities I miss most when I have to use a Windows PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocket is a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819747/rocket-review.html\">simple, <em>free</em> utility</a> from Matthew Palmer that adds Slack-style emoji typing throughout your system. That’s it, that’s all it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you spend all day on Slack like I do, you know how fast and easy it is to add emojis. Type a colon (:) followed immediately by a search term, and a little pop-up emoji picker shows relevant emojis. You can pick one from the list (with the mouse or arrow keys) or keep typing to narrow it down and just press Enter.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/slack-emoji.png\" alt=\"slack emoji picker\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/slack-emoji.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 982w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/slack-emoji.png?resize=300%2C119&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/slack-emoji.png?resize=768%2C303&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"982\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The Slack emoji picker is great. With Rocket you can have it everywhere.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes using emoji, which I use <em>a lot</em>, an intuitive part of the typing process instead of a separate activity. Rocket simply makes that same emoji typing experience available system-wide. There are a few welcome options, such as the ability to disable Rocket when using certain apps in which it interferes, or when on certain websites. You can choose a custom skin one for relevant emojis, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a $10 <a href=\"https://store.matthewpalmer.net/rocket-pro\">Rocket Pro</a> upgrade that adds the ability to build a library of custom GIFs or images that you can summon the same way, along with some stats and text expander snippets. I’m happy to pay, but I never use any of those features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to make a request, it would be to allow for a simple way to look at emoji variants in the picker. Many emojis these days have multiple variations, and it would be great to find one with a few taps of the keyboard. The preferred default skin tone selection handles some of them, but you don’t always want to change up a whole default just to get the right variant of one or two emojis. And not every emoji variation is a skin tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hey, it’s free, it’s lightweight, it’s kept up to date, and it makes my Mac more enjoyable to use. It’s hard to complain about that.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"299e406c51d10d49c90f6ce42f1eb7e1ad99af5594febcb2c4f7ca6096222a35","category":"Apple"}
