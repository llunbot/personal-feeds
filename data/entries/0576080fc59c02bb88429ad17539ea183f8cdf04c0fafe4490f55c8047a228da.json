Your cost, for the 256GB\nversion, is $1,100. The cost of all the hardware inside — aka the\nbill of materials — was about $550 to Apple when the phone was\nintroduced, says Wayne Lam, research analyst at TechInsights,\nwhich breaks down major products. Throw in assembly and testing\nand Apple’s cost rises to around $580. Even when you account for\nApple’s advertising budget and all the included services — iMessage, iCloud, etc. — there’s still a healthy profit margin.</p>\n\n<p>Now factor in the newly announced tariff for goods from China,\nwhich currently totals 54%. The cost rises to around $850. That\nprofit margin would shrink dramatically if Apple didn’t up the\nprice. And you don’t become a trillion-dollar gadget company by\ncharging for things at cost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also worth a look is <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/wsj-front-page-5-april-2025.jpeg\">today’s front page of the WSJ print edition</a>.
