Today, Alphabet's moonshot \"X Lab\" <a href=\"https://x.company/blog/posts/taara-beaming-broadband-across-congo/\">shared an update</a> on Project Taara, its experimental point-to-point optical communication system, often described as \"fiber optics without the fiber.\" The company built a working installation in Africa and has been blasting a 20Gbps link about 5 km across the Congo River to a town of millions of people, lowering the cost of Internet access for them.</p>\n<p>The Taara laser beam is bridging the gap between Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which are on opposite sides of the Congo River. Brazzaville has decent Internet, but because nobody wanted to run a fiber line through the world's deepest and second-fastest river, Kinshasa uses a fiber line that runs 400 km <em>around</em> the river, and the Internet is five times more expensive there. Alphabet's 20Gbps commercial link has been up and running for 20 days now, and the company says it has served nearly 700TB of data in that time, with 99.9 percent uptime.</p>\n<p>Taara was born out of the \"Loon\" Internet balloon project launched <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/alphabet-wants-to-deliver-internet-access-via-laser-beams/\">in 2017</a>. Originally, Google was building flying cell towers to beam down the Internet from the sky (over RF), but for balloon-to-balloon backhaul, the company was planning communications via laser beam. Space X just started doing something similar by equipping its Starlink satellites with <em>space lasers</em> for optical intra-satellite communication. One benefit of Sky- and space-based laser communication is that not much can interfere with a point-to-point optical beam. Ground-based lasers have more interference to consider, since they have to deal with nearly everything: rain, fog, birds, and once, according to Alphabet's blog post, \"a curious monkey.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795716#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795716&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f57ae68397ea2210ce78fa1407e5b935b23c3783f85d76a42d9b7a56da717473","category":"Tech"}
