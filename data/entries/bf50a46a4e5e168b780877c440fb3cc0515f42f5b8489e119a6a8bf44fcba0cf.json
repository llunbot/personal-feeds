The mission was successful, and Russia has launched hundreds of these spacecraft before. So it wasn't all that big of a deal, except for one small detail: This was just Russia's ninth orbital launch of the year.</p>\n<p>At this pace, it appears that the country's space program is on pace for the fewest number of Russian or Soviet space launches in a year since 1961. That was when Yuri Gagarin went to space at the dawn of the human spaceflight era.</p>\n<p>There are myriad reasons for this, including a decision by Western space powers to distance themselves from the Russian space corporation, Roscosmos, after the invasion of Ukraine. This has had disastrous effects on the Russian space program, but only recently have we gotten any insight into how deep those impacts have cut.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043549#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043549&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bf50a46a4e5e168b780877c440fb3cc0515f42f5b8489e119a6a8bf44fcba0cf","category":"Tech"}
