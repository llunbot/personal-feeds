Now, one of Arm's biggest customers is trying out RISC-V, as Qualcomm is <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/08/leading-semiconductor-industry-players-join-forces-to-accelerate\">getting involved</a> in a joint venture dedicated to the architecture.</p>\n<p>The joint venture doesn't have a name yet, but Qualcomm, NXP, Nordic Semiconductor, Bosch, and memory giant Infineon are all teaming up to form a new company that Qualcomm's press release says is \"aimed at advancing the adoption of RISC-V globally by enabling next-generation hardware development.\" At first, the group will be focused on automotive uses, with an \"eventual expansion\" to IoT and mobile, Qualcomm's biggest market.</p>\n<p>Arm doesn't manufacture any chips itself and instead exists as a design and licensing operation. It licenses both the Arm architecture, allowing companies to design an Arm-compatible chip themselves (this is what Apple does), and it also licenses completed CPU designs, allowing partners like Qualcomm, Samsung, and MediaTek to produce new SoCs year after year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958894#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958894&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8451bae049e92a2775984f3681c33e8522d525a70fddee7140c84bd4430905bc","category":"Tech"}
