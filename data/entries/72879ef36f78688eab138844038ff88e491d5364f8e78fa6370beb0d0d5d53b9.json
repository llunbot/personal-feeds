As of now, there is little difference between the AirPods 2 and ‌AirPods 3‌ beyond the design, which Gurman says is confusing to customers and costs Apple money when consumers opt for the cheaper model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌AirPods 4‌ will streamline the available AirPods options. The earbuds will feature an updated design, which Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/\">outlined in October</a>. The new AirPods are expected to look like a cross between the current AirPods and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, with shorter stems. Fit is expected to be improved, but it is as of yet unclear if Apple will add silicone ear tips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA redesigned case will include speakers for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> alerts, and a USB-C charging port rather than a Lightning port. The higher-end version of the AirPods will feature Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which has to date been limited to the ‌AirPods Pro‌. It will allow customers to get ANC at a more affordable price point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a software update coming later next year, Apple will add hearing aid functionality, allowing AirPods to serve as an over-the-counter (OTC) hearing alternative to traditional hearing aids. The FDA in 2022 approved <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/hearing-aids/otc-hearing-aids-what-you-should-know\">OTC hearing aid options</a>, paving the way for Apple to market the AirPods for hearing loss. Gurman has said that Apple also plans to offer hearing tests that would tell AirPods users if they are experiencing hearing loss.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods 4‌ will launch in 2024, perhaps around September when Apple unveils new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models. Apple is also planning for a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> in 2024, but the update will be limited to new colors and the addition of a USB-C charging port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's more expensive ‌AirPods Pro‌ will be refreshed in 2025, with Apple set to introduce an updated design \"focused on comfort\" and a faster chip.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/\">AirPods Pro 3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/\">AirPods 4 to Get New Design, Updated Case, and Active Noise Cancellation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-to-get-new-design-updated-case-and-active-noise-cancellation.2413979/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"72879ef36f78688eab138844038ff88e491d5364f8e78fa6370beb0d0d5d53b9","category":"Apple"}
