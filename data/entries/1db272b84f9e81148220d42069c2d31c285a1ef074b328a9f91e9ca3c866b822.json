There is a 20-minute launch window on Saturday, opening at 7 am CST (13:00 UTC), shortly after sunrise in South Texas.</p>\n<p>A delay at this point is unsurprising. Starship is a complex launch vehicle with a sum of 39 methane-burning engines, each producing roughly a half-million pounds of thrust, powering its booster stage and upper stage. And this is only the second test flight of SpaceX's new full-scale, nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) rocket, the largest launch vehicle ever built.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984487#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984487&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1db272b84f9e81148220d42069c2d31c285a1ef074b328a9f91e9ca3c866b822","category":"Tech"}
