{"title":"Why the Apple Watch needs a reboot","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2564441/why-the-apple-watch-needs-a-reboot.html","date":1735304400000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/224103/meet-apple-watch-the-new-apple-smartwatch-with-a-clever-new-navigation-scheme.html\">unveiled the Apple Watch</a> ten years ago last September, prompting the rumour mill to speculate about an anniversary watch—just like the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667617/iphone-x-review-2.html\">iPhone X</a> once was. The Apple Watch X was supposed to feature a new magnetic wristband system that could free up more space in the case for the battery and other modules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several months ago, there was speculation about an estimate of blood pressure, which Apple is said to have finally succeeded in doing. Just a few years ago, the blogosphere was buzzing about blood glucose measurement, but hopes for this feature to arrive has shifted to the late 2020s, if then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Apple presented in September was without question a solid update: the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478899/apple-watch-series-10-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Series 10</a> has retained the best of the Apple Watch Ultra, with larger battery sacrificed for even less weight and even slimmer dimensions. But even for me as an Apple Watch enthusiast, there was a strange aftertaste: like when you’re looking forward to cold sparkling water on a hot day and are served lukewarm, stale soda instead. In short, it was somewhat disappointing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not just me. The latest sales figures for Apple’s wearables division show this. The Apple Watch makes up a large part of Apple’s balance sheet, as can be seen from the reliable spikes every first quarter when the accounts for the Apple Watch presented in September roll in. The Apple Watch reached its peak with Series 7, introduced at the end of 2021. Since then, not even the new Apple Watch Ultra has been able to generate noticeable growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the coronavirus pandemic played into the Apple Watch’s hands. Above all, Apple introduced the hand-washing reminder just one version earlier. Blood oxygen saturation could also be monitored with the Apple Watch since the Series 6. Since then, however, Apple’s smartwatch has offered few arguments for switching to it, apart from the new Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"3210\" height=\"2140\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3210w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" alt=\"Editors' Choice\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478899/apple-watch-series-10-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$349 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-Denim-Sport-Band-S-M/11385870491\" target=\"_blank\">$349 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=ACMWWD3LWA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmwwd3lwa.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102\" target=\"_blank\">$399 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The main line around the Series 8, 9 and 10 only brought evolutionary improvements: Series 8 brought a temperature sensor for the first time and an improved accelerometer that could detect car accidents,<a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2088514/apple-watch-9-test.html\"> Series 9 was </a>eclipsed by the new Ultra<a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2088514/apple-watch-9-test.html\"> despite the new one-handed operation </a>, Series 10 had inherited the water temperature sensor from the Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch is no longer unique – or is it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look around the market, Apple Watch doesn’t offer any unique features. Withings &amp; Co. also have comprehensive health monitoring and provide comparable vital signs. Garmin also offers outdoor maps and tracks your own hikes, like the Ultra. The Samsung Galaxy Watch has a blood pressure estimate on board, albeit with huge compromises, more on this later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhat absurd, but a unique selling point of the Apple Watch is the huge range of wristbands from third-party manufacturers. With my test samples alone, I could wear a “new” Apple Watch every day, with a matching colour or material for every top or dress. The connection to the iPhone and the overall package of features can also convince customers. But these are arguments that only emerge after the purchase, not before.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Ultra 2</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra 2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Trail-Loop-orange-beige-230912.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2087162/apple-watch-ultra-vs-ultra-2-s9-display-double-tap-storage-battery.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$799 (base)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra\" target=\"_blank\">$799 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-2023-49mm-titanium-case-with-blue-alpine-loop-medium/-/A-85973656\" target=\"_blank\">$799.99 at  Target </a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX7J5Z3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$849.55 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>This impression of stagnation is probably due to Apple’s philosophy regarding health. On the one hand, the company has the ambition to positively influence the lives of humanity, or at least the part of it that can afford an Apple Watch. On the other hand, this means that the new health functions will only be released if they are also beneficial from a medical perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t want to release features like the blood pressure feature on Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, where the user has to calibrate the watch’s blood pressure data at regular intervals using a conventional cuff. The Galaxy Watch has also not been included in the European Society of Hypertension’s database of validated devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research takes time, and Apple’s ambitions are high. This is precisely why the new blood pressure estimation function has been delayed by at least a year. But Apple must finally introduce something fundamentally new in the health sector. Both the Apple Watch and its users can cope with the new start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on our <a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2559747/apple-watch-neustart.html\">sister publication Macwelt</a> and was translated and localized from German.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"202e8578556e21a303d39580ae354146872ff00910f93d777d336a52e69b53a5","category":"Apple"}
