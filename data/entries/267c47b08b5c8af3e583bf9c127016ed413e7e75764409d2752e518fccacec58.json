The company confirmed the date with invitations sent out to members of the press this morning.</p>\n<p>The invitation named the date, included (as usual) a cryptic image, specified that the event would be broadcast from Apple Park, and included the word \"Wonderlust\" as a teaser.</p>\n<p>While it does say the event would be broadcast from Apple Park, it's worth noting that since 2020 Apple has actually streamed a video that was prerecorded before the day of the event rather than doing a stage presentation. Insiders so far have said that will continue this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964019#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964019&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"267c47b08b5c8af3e583bf9c127016ed413e7e75764409d2752e518fccacec58","category":"Tech"}
