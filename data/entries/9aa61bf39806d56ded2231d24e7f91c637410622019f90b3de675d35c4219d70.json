While the 16e shares many important features with the ‌iPhone 15‌, there are still 30 significant differences between the devices to be aware of–not least <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-vs-15-Buyers-Guide.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThere is a merely $100 price difference between the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 16e‌. To justify this, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ misses out on features such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> connectivity. However, there are some areas where the 16e is actively better than the 15, such as the Action button, chip, and battery life.

While the ‌iPhone 15‌ is $100 more expensive than the ‌iPhone 16e‌, it misses out on the Action button, Wind noise reduction, Audio Mix, Spatial Audio recording, the A18 chip and ‌Apple Intelligence‌, Visual intelligence, the C1 modem, and six additional hours of battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstead, the $100 jump is seemingly justified by the ‌Dynamic Island‌, brighter display, Ultra Wide camera, sensor-shift image stabilization, next-generation portraits, Macro mode, Cinematic mode, Action mode, Thread and Ultra Wideband connectivity, ‌MagSafe‌, and color options–which may not be important to some customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌'s lack of ‌Apple Intelligence‌ support is a major omission and it is difficult to recommend a device that is more expensive, less powerful, and less future proof. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is a better long-term investment since it is likely to support future ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features, offering a better long-term experience and more desirability in the second-hand market. Its markedly better battery life is also worth noting when it comes to the long-term view of using the device. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is almost a year and a half newer than the ‌iPhone 15‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the large display of the 6.7-inch ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus is essential, then it is likely still worth opting for this option over the ‌iPhone 16e‌. Likewise, if an Ultra Wide camera or ‌MagSafe‌ are absolutely essential, the ‌iPhone 15‌ is the only way to go. Otherwise, most customers should save the $100 and buy the ‌iPhone 16e‌.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16e/\">iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16e Buyer's Guide: 25+ Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16e-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2449791/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9aa61bf39806d56ded2231d24e7f91c637410622019f90b3de675d35c4219d70","category":"Apple"}
