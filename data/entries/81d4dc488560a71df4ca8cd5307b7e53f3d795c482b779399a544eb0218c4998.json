Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple is “gearing up” for a March release of the M4 MacBook Air. And in case you didn’t notice, March is only a week away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman reports that the current inventory of the M3 MacBook Air is being “drawn down” to make room for the upgrade. He doesn’t provide a specific release date, but perhaps Apple’s current <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/au-edu/shop/back-to-school/terms-conditions\">Higher Education Offer 2025</a> promotion in Australia and other regions offers a clue. The promotion, which includes the M3 MacBook Air, ends on March 13. So it’s likely Apple will launch the M4 MacBook Air after that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">back-to-school promotion</a> is over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That puts the most likely launch of the MacBook Air during the week of March 17 or March 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">reports</a> had said that the new MacBook Air will feature a version of the M4 chip, which was introduced in November with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2510333/14-inch-m4-macbook-pro-review.html\">14-inch MacBook Pro</a>. The current entry-level MacBook Air has 2 fewer graphics cores (8 versus 10) than the higher-end models, so it’s likely Apple will continue this trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major upgrade that could find its way onto the M4 MacBook Air is a 12MP CenterStage camera, replacing the current 1080p one, which debuted with the M4 MacBook Pro. Apple also upgraded the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2505858/apple-just-gave-the-macbook-air-a-huge-upgrade-you-probably-didnt-notice.html\">M3 MacBook Air to start with 16GB of RAM</a> back in October of last year. We don’t expect Apple to raise prices with the M4 MacBook Air, which should continue to start at $1,099.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the M3 chip is a great chip, behind the scenes it created a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2578508/m4-macbook-air-m3-chip-production-cost-yield-imac-mac-studio.html\">conundrum</a> for Apple. Its production process is more expensive than the one for the M4, so Apple wants to move off the M3. That could mean that Apple will keep the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">M2 MacBook Air</a> as its most affordable laptop–its M2 chip is older but still provides enough performance for most people. Apple also kept the M1 MacBook Air for two generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about the M4 MacBook Air, stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air release guide</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"81d4dc488560a71df4ca8cd5307b7e53f3d795c482b779399a544eb0218c4998","category":"Apple"}
