Shows including <em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1512839/ted-lasso-season-3-premiere-date-episodes-final.html\">Ted Lasso</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/for-all-mankind/umc.cmc.6wsi780sz5tdbqcf11k76mkp7\">For All Mankind</a></em>, as well as movies like <em><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/greyhound/umc.cmc.o5z5ztufuu3uv8lx7m0jcega\">Greyhound</a></em>, starring Tom Hanks. You can even watch a couple of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/630083/how-to-watch-major-league-baseball-games-apple-tv.html\" target=\"_blank\">MLB games every Friday night</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple TV+ costs $9.99/£8.99 (it was $6.99/£6.99 until October 2023, and prior to October 2022 it was $4.99/£4.99 a month). This is still less than other streaming services, but it also offers less content than many other streaming services, lacking the huge back-catalogues of films and TV shows on offer from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, or Disney+.

We’ll run through your options. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: This weekend (3-5 January) Apple is making <a href=\"http://tv.apple.com\">Apple TV</a> free for everyone! So if you want to try it out and watch what you like – even if you have had a trial before – take advantage of this deal! </strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2566198/the-entire-apple-tv-catalog-is-free-to-watch-this-weekend.html\">The entire Apple TV+ catalog is free to watch this weekend.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the year, Apple offers a free seven-day trial which might be long enough for you to binge a series (if you don’t sleep for a week). But there are also longer trials available. Read on to find out how to watch Apple TV for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various companies are bundling a free Apple TV+ subscription with their services. For example, there is the option to get a free year subscription to <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/tv-streaming/apple-tv-plus-deal\">Apple TV+ with T-Mobile</a> (if you live in the US), you can also get three months <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/apple-tv-playstation-offers/\" target=\"_blank\">free Apple TV+ with a PlayStation 5</a> or PlayStation 4. Find out more about these deals below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch episodes on Apple TV+ for free</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of ways in which you can watch shows on Apple TV+ for free. Apple offers limited-time trials (discussed below), and the service also allows you to watch the first episode of many shows for free. In fact there are several dozen episodes available to watch for free including the first episodes of <em>Ted Lasso</em>, <em>The Morning Show</em>, <em>See</em>, <em>Trying</em>, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675793/what-is-free-on-apple-tv.html\" target=\"_blank\">What is free on Apple TV+?</a> in our separate article.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3777103/free_apple_tv_shows.jpg\" alt=\"Free Apple TV Shows\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple offers various trials so that you can try out Apple TV+ before you subscribe, we detail all the trials you can take advantage of below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, none of these offers are available if you or your Family have previously accepted an Apple TV+ 1 year free offer from when the service first launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the trial period is up the $9.99/£8.99 a month subscription will start immediately – but you can easily cancel this. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231231/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-on-ios.html\">How to cancel an Apple subscription</a>. To avoid paying you need to cancel the subscription the day before it is due to renew. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get 7 days of Apple TV+ free</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to watch a show, and have plenty of time in the immediate future, you could activate your free seven-day trial and binge-watch it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(There was a short period when Apple stopped offering the 7-day trial in the U.K. and South Africa, but this trial does seem to be running again now). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can subscribe to Apple TV+ on <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s website here</a>, or via the Apple TV app on your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7-day trial will automatically auto-renew into a monthly subscription though, so you will need to be prepared to cancel within the week if you don’t want to be out of pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7-day trial might sound attractive if you think you can watch a whole series in a week. But make sure the whole series is available, as Apple typically adds new episodes on a weekly basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to cancel a subscription go to <em>Settings</em> and click on the <em>Apple ID</em> section on your iPhone. Tap on <em>Subscriptions</em>. Locate Apple TV+ in the <em>Active</em> list and then <em>Cancel Subscription</em>. More details on how to cancel your subscription below. Note that you won’t find Apple TV+ in the Active list until the trial ends. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231231/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-on-ios.html\" target=\"_blank\">How to cancel a subscription on iPhone, iPad or Mac</a> for more help.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/\" target=\"_blank\">Get 7 days Apple TV+ for free</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>Get 1 month of Apple TV+ free </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you’ve never used the service before, you can actually get a free month if you sign up for the one-month trial of Apple One. That trial will also include free one-month trials for Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and iCloud+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the month’s trial, the subscription starts at $19.95/£18.95 a month as an individual, but there are different plans available and crucially you can cancel at any time.

Apple Watch, HomePod, AirPods, and other Apple devices do not qualify. In short, your device qualifies if it’s a new Apple device that can actually run the TV app and watch Apple TV+ content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the three months is up the $9.99/£8.99 a month subscription will start immediately unless you cancel it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is necessary to claim the deal within 90 days of setting up your new device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Apple TV+ free with an Apple Music student subscription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to get Apple TV+ for free is to sign up for a student subscription to Apple Music. If you qualify as a student in Higher Education you will be able to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674847/students-can-get-apple-tv-free-with-half-price-apple-music.html\" target=\"_blank\">get Apple Music for half price,</a> and as an added benefit Apple is bundling free Apple TV+ subscriptions with student subscriptions to Apple Music. You qualify for free Apple TV+ for as long as you subscribe as a student. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A student subscription to Apple Music costs $5.99/£5.99 a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928\" target=\"_blank\">this Apple page</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple TV+ free with a Student Apple Music subscription (U.S.)</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple TV+ free with a Student Apple Music subscription (U.K.)</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>Get 12 months Apple TV+ for the price of 10 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to save money is to pay Apple for the year up-front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you sign up for the service rather than choosing to pay monthly (which has the benefit of being able to cancel at any time) opt to pay yearly. That will cost you $99.99/£89 up-front, which works out at $8.33/£7.41 a month, rather than the standard $9.99/£8.99 a month. Or $9.99/£8.99 a month for 10 months instead of 12. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>On your iPhone, go to Settings and click on your Apple ID info at the top. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Subscriptions. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beside Apple Music tap on See All Plans. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Switch to Individual Plan to save money (you won’t be able to cancel this subscription until the end of the 12 months though). </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/\" target=\"_blank\">Get two months free with a year's subscription</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>Other Apple TV+ Deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not only Apple that offers free Apple TV+ trials. Some third parties offer even longer deals than Apple does. You’ll find U.S. and U.K deals below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember that at the end of the trial you may need to cancel with Apple if you don’t want the subscription to start. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Apple TV+ for free with PlayStation 5</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a 3 month Apple TV free deal with PlayStation 5 (there was a six-month deal, but that deal ended on July 31, 2023.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>PlayStation 4 users can also apply for the deal.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/apple-tv-playstation-offers/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple TV+ for 3 months with Sony Playstation 5</a></div>\n\n\n<h2><em>U.S. Apple TV+ deals </em></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Apple TV+ for free with T-Mobile </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>T-Mobile offers Apple TV+ for free on a couple of its smartphone plans.

After five days you should receive an email from Currys including the link to get three months of Apple services for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/services/newsletter-sign-up.html\">Currys Perks Loyalty Scheme</a> to qualify. </p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/brands/apple/apple-offers/apple-services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Get 3 months free Apple TV+ with Currys</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>How to claim your free trial of Apple TV+ from Apple</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having made a qualifying purchase, or decided to try out the free 7-day trial, all you need to do is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure the device is running the latest software.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the TV app on your new Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in to your Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the show you want to watch—you should see the option to <em>Enjoy Three Months Free</em>. Note: This will only appear if you have purchased a new device, otherwise you will only see the 7-day trial offer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Continue</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Confirm that you want to activate the free trial.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will see a message that the free trial will commence immediately and will run until the end of the trial at which point it will renew for a monthly subscription. If you want to cancel the subscription you can do so.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You have 90 days from buying a new device to start the free year’s subscription, so as long as you purchased your new Apple product recently then you should be ok to activate your trial. Also, if you stop the free trial before it ends you can’t restart it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you are thinking of buying a new Apple device later? Will you be able to switch from a subscription to the free trial? We think that the way to do this would be to cancel your subscription before signing up again via the three-month trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to share an Apple TV+ subscription with your family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also share a subscription to TV+ with six family members—yourself and five others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this you all need to be part of the same Family Sharing group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By linking your Apple accounts together under the Family Sharing group you will all be able to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Share music purchased from the iTunes Store</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share access to Apple Music (as long as you have a family Apple Music subscription)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share apps bought from the App Store (in app purchases can’t be shared though)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share Apple Books</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access games on Apple’s Arcade gaming platform (with a subscription)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share a News+ subscription</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share an iCloud storage plan</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of your family members will need to be the family organizer, who basically chooses who joins the group, and has to put up their bank details to pay for any purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s supposed to be family members in the same household. While you could set this up with other ‘family’ members we think the frustration of having all the payments for everything going through the ‘organiser’s’ bank account could make this a hard sell. However, if does at least mean that you and your partner don’t both have to subscribe to the service in order to watch shows on both of your iPhones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to cancel an Apple TV+ subscription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s a few ways to get Apple TV+ for free, at least for a short time, or by sharing a subscription with a family member.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we think the best way to get access to Apple TV+ is to subscribe as usual but just cancel at any time.
