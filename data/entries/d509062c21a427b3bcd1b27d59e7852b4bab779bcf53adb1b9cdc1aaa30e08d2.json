Installing the new beta upgrades and essentially removes the Experience and Control Panel apps, but they're still available online.</p>\n<p>But perhaps most importantly, Nvidia's new app allows you to update the driver for your graphics card, the one you paid for, without having to log in to an Nvidia account. I tested it, it worked, and I don't know why I was surprised, but I've been conditioned that way. Given that driver updates are something people often do with new systems and the prior tendencies of Nvidia's apps to log you out, this is a boon that will pay small but notable cumulative dividends for some time to come.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005363#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005363&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d509062c21a427b3bcd1b27d59e7852b4bab779bcf53adb1b9cdc1aaa30e08d2","category":"Tech"}
