Read on to find out what enduro is all about, why you might want to give it a go and what you need to get started.</p>\n<h2>What is enduro racing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male mountain biker Alex Evans riding a We Are One Arrival 152 enduro mountain bike fitted with SRAM's XX T-Type Eagle Transmission Powermeter AXS groupset\" title=\"SRAM XX T-Type Eagle Transmission Powermeter AXS groupset-12\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Enduro racing has become increasingly popular as a gravity-orientated discipline.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s a clue in the name – it’s gravity racing but with an endurance element. In the early days, ‘enduro’ races were long-distance cross-country races, but those now tend to be known as marathon races.</p>\n<p>Modern enduro events are very different. Enduro races are made up of multiple downhill stages, which are timed to generate the event’s result, while the uphills are ‘liaisons’.</p>\n<p>Here, riders have to reach the start of the next stage within a time limit but, providing a rider meets that time limit, the actual time doesn’t contribute to the final result. Got it?</p>\n<p>Enduro races tend to last one or two days with riders normally completing up to six timed downhill stages per day. The cumulative times of all their stage results are added together to create their overall time, which ultimately decides a rider’s finishing position in the field.</p>\n<p>Whether riders pedal to the top of each downhill stage or jump on a form of uplift transport (vans, buses, chairlifts or cable cars) depends heavily on where the event is organised and the amount of elevation change the day’s riding (or a particular stage transition) has.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Drag your heels on the climbs and it won't matter how rapid you are on the downhills\" title=\"1364384027676-1nhgjcxfmsfda-be01e7b\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Drag your heels on the climbs and it won’t matter how rapid you are on the downhills.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish</i></span></div>\n<p>The best-known and biggest enduro event is the UCI Enduro World Cup (EDR), which has taken over from the Enduro World Series (EWS). The UCI Enduro World Cup visits some of the world’s best riding spots for each of its rounds. Each round has a winner and there’s also a series winner at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Many smaller, local enduro events also exist, and some of these have UCI Enduro World Cup qualifier status, which means if you place high enough, you could enter a UCI Enduro World Cup event.</p>\n<p>If you fancy a slice of the UCI Enduro World Cup action but can’t or don’t want to qualify, there are two open racing events, which allow non-qualifying riders to race with the winner receiving a qualifying spot for a UCI Enduro World Cup round.</p>\n<h2>What’s so good about enduro racing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The finish line is in sight – time for the banter to begin!\" title=\"1364384027687-132kq6wzmihiu-4fa9b11\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The finish line is in sight – time for the banter to begin.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish</i></span></div>\n<p>Downhill racing requires extreme technical skill (and bravery) and expensive kit, while cross-country racing is largely about fitness (although XC race courses are becoming increasingly more technical, with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/evolution-of-xc-bikes/\">cross-country bikes becoming more capable as a result</a>).</p>\n<p>However, anyone with a decent <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bike</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">downcountry bike</a>, some technical riding experience and enough stamina to ride their local singletrack for a couple of hours can have a bash at enduro racing.</p>\n<p>You might also find yourself already riding enduro without knowing it. After all, enduro isn’t only about racing, it’s a style of riding in itself.</p>\n<p>Do you pedal efficiently but relatively slowly to the top of descents, where you then ride as hard and as fast as you can downhill, expending the most energy? If so, you’re already an enduro rider!</p>\n<p>Enduro racing is also arguably better value for money than downhill racing. You get a lot more riding for your entrance fee than at a downhill race, because you ride multiple stages rather than just one track. This also means a mishap or mechanical won’t necessarily put you out of the running because it’s the overall time that counts, rather than individual stages.</p>\n<p>The other big thing going for enduro races is the friendly atmosphere. While the top riders are definitely in it to win it, further down the field it’s more about having a go and enjoying a bit of finish-line banter.</p>\n<p>The same, of course, could be said for almost any event – mountain bikers are generally a friendly bunch.</p>\n<h2>What type of bike do I need for enduro racing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida One-Sixty 6000\" title=\"Merida-One-Sixty-6000-One-Sixty-pack-1557f3d_BOTY 2023 winner\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Merida One-Sixty 6000 came out tops in our 2023 Enduro Bike of the Year test.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To race enduro competitively, you’ll want a full-suspension bike with at least 140mm of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a>, and up to 170-180mm of travel.</p>\n<p>The growing profile of enduro racing, and the popularity of enduro as a style of riding, means that a lot of mountain bike brands now offer<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\"> enduro bikes</a> designed and specced specifically for the demands of the discipline.</p>\n<p>There are dedicated enduro bikes, built specifically for the racing format.

dominated, from former World Cup downhill stars Nicolas Vouilloz and Anne-Caroline Chausson, to enduro specialists such as Jerome Clementz and Rémy Absalon.</p>\n<p>More recently, we’ve seen French riders such as Isabeau Courdurier and Morgane Charre battle it out with Brits, Bex Baraona and Harriet Harnden, in the women’s field.</p>\n<p>In the men’s field, the French dominance of old has been diluted, with stiff competition from Canadians Rhys Verner and Jesse Melamed, who have both battled USA’s Richie Rude for the top spots.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth keeping an eye out for Charles Murray, Slawomir Lukasik and Youn Deniaud, who are all capable of competing at the sharp end of racing.</p>\n<p>Top ranked British riders include Alex Storr of Forbidden Factory Racing and Mathew Stuttard from Polygon Factory Racing.</p>\n<p>And although Tracy Moseley is from the old guard, she’s still a contender for the title in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bike</a> series.</p>\n<h2>Where can I have a go at enduro racing?</h2>\n<h3>UCI Enduro World
