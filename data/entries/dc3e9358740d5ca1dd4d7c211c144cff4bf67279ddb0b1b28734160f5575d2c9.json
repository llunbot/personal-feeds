The launches mark the first time the Vision Pro has been officially available outside of the United States, where the device has been on sale since February.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-availability-Wangfujing-Beijing-first-purchase.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nConsumer interest in the $3,499 headset has reportedly waned at home, where sales are said to have slowed in the five months since its launch. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> is set to launch in the United Kingdom and Canada on July 12. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headset will also launch on the same day in Australia, France, and Germany, as part of a staggered release in additional markets, which may be just what the company needs to reinvigorate enthusiasm for the device.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nReviews for the device have been mixed overall. For the most part, users have been impressed with the hardware and the technology introduced by the Vision Pro, but there are questions about the actual function of the device, the intuitiveness of the gesture-based control, the weight and comfort, and VR in general.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring WWDC earlier this month, Apple announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a>, the first major update to the Vision Pro's operating system. ‌visionOS 2‌ includes several new features and changes, including a redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app with SharePlay support, the ability to turn existing 2D photos into spatial photos, a larger ultra-wide version of Mac Virtual Display that is equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side, plus support for a physical mouse.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/28/apple-vision-pro-launches-china-japan-singapore/\">Apple Vision Pro Launches in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-launches-in-china-hong-kong-japan-and-singapore.2430257/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dc3e9358740d5ca1dd4d7c211c144cff4bf67279ddb0b1b28734160f5575d2c9","category":"Apple"}
