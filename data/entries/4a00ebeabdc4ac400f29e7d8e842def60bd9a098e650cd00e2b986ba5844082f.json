The fourth developer beta ought to be out in a couple of weeks, and it's reasonably likely to coincide with the first betas that Apple offers to the full public (though the less-stable developer-only betas got significantly more public last year when Apple <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/how-to-install-ios-17-and-macos-14-developer-betas-now-that-anyone-can-do-it/\">stopped making people pay for a developer account to access them</a>).</p>\n<p>Many of the new updates' features are present and available to test, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/my-favorite-macos-sequoia-feature-so-far-might-be-the-old-timey-mac-wallpaper/\">cosmetic updates</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-quietly-improves-mac-virtualization-in-macos-15-sequoia/\">under-the-hood improvements</a>. But none of Apple's much-hyped Apple Intelligence features are available to test in any form. MacRumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/ios-18-beta-3-simulator-apple-intelligence/\">reports</a> that Settings menus for the Apple Intelligence features have appeared in the Xcode Simulator for current versions of iOS 18 but, as of now, those settings still appear to be non-functional placeholders that don't actually do anything.</p>\n\n<p>That may change soon; Apple did say that the first wave of Apple Intelligence features would be available \"this summer,\" and I would wager a small amount of money on the first ones being available in the public beta builds later this month. But the current state of the betas does reinforce <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p\">reporting</a> from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman that suggested Apple was \"caught flat-footed\" by the tech world's intense interest in generative AI.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036215#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036215&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a00ebeabdc4ac400f29e7d8e842def60bd9a098e650cd00e2b986ba5844082f","category":"Tech"}
