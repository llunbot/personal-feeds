It also hides any evidence of compromise. “The first objective of the GhostEngine malware is to incapacitate endpoint security solutions and disable specific Windows event logs, such as Security and System logs, which record process creation and service registration,” <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/invisible-miners-unveiling-ghostengine\">said</a> researchers from Elastic Security Labs, who discovered the attacks.</p>\n<p>When it first executes, GhostEngine scans machines for any EDR, or endpoint protection and response, software that may be running. If it finds any, it loads drivers known to contain vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain access to the kernel, the core of all operating systems that’s heavily restricted to prevent tampering. One of the vulnerable drivers is an anti-rootkit file from Avast named aswArPots.sys. GhostEngine uses it to terminate the EDR security agent. A malicious file named smartscreen.exe then uses a driver from IObit named iobitunlockers.sys to delete the security agent binary.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026052#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026052&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f573690a8369e8112f079d2725f96450c001391bcc6f11482d439f81ce9b2c9","category":"Tech"}
