The sector is ‘well off pace’ to stick to the 1.5C warming limit set out in the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">Paris Agreement</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report adds that in order to mitigate these emissions, the industry needs to increase energy efficiency and switch to renewables and recycled polyester. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But using recycled fabrics does not automatically make a product sustainable, it is much more complex than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What do we mean by sustainable cycling kit?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"rapha_insider_01\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002804/rapha_insider_01.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most sustainable cycling clothing is that which is already in your wardrobe or which you can find second-hand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really do need something new, we’ve got the lowdown on the most sustainable brands to help you make a more conscious choice. Key things taken into consideration are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fabrics</li><li>Manufacturing</li><li>Shipping</li><li>Energy sources</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Circularity</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have tried and tested products from each brand, but given we can’t assess a garment’s precise material composition ourselves, or see a company’s actual energy bill, we have to take a brand’s claims at face value to an extent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many brands use third party organisations to guide them on their sustainability journey which are regularly mentioned here. These ensure that the materials are safe for the end consumer. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bluesign.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Bluesign</a> is a sustainability standard which evaluates organisations, reviews supply chains, and particularly considers the chemical composition of textile products to ensure healthy and safe materials.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Oeko-Tex</a> is a standard based on a testing and certification process which certifies non-hazardous end-products and all of their components.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">B Corp</a> is a certifcation where a company is assessed on things such as working standards and supply chain practices and given a score out of 200 – they must score at least 80 and are then judged to have high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of complexities around what it really means for a brand to be sustainable. It is best to look for a combination of ethics, sustainability and transparency in a brand’s claims as well as its overall approach to production. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-to-do-with-old-cycling-kit-bikes-parts\">Here’s what to do with all the bike stuff you don’t need</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-hidden-cost-of-the-tour\">Examining the environmental impact of the Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-green-is-cycling-kit\">How green is my jersey?

However, the brand hopes to increase the latter figure to 100% in 2023 onwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand also only markets a product as recycled if it uses more than 50% recycled yarns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020 Endura launched its One Million Trees initiative, where it committed to planting one million trees every year for the next ten years in order to offset its carbon footprint and aims to become carbon negative by 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tree planting began in Mozambique, and has now also started in Scotland, the brand’s home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Endura products have been PFC Free since 2018 and the company produces all of its custom garments in its factory in Scotland and the rest in China and Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy kit from <a href=\"https://www.endurasport.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Endura</a> </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><a></a>3.

The wool comes from New Zealand and Australia and then gets processed in Germany where the yarns are produced.

It’s wrong to assume that customers know what reproofing is.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it isn’t straightforward as Hurd explains: ‘We have our own paradox and our own complications because we know our price points are not accessible for everyone. But I think we are very clear and transparent about our fabrics, our costs and have strong ethical policies that we stand by.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003311/uc_gilet_.jpeg\" alt=\"uc_gilet_\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand also champions a circular approach, notably in its 100% taste-free <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/assos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-gilet\" target=\"_blank\">biodegradable polyethylene bottle constructed using sugarcane</a>, which can be wholly recycled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the correct temperature in a landfill or under leaves and soil in a forest, the bio-batch additive activates, and the bottle decomposes into water, humus and gas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand says the composting process takes 1-5 years, compared to 450 years for a traditional plastic bottle, and the bottle becomes part of the natural world again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of its products are produced at LTP in Lithuania which is a Bluesign-accredited factory, and the brand also works with a factories in China and Taiwan for select products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal Colours is currently looking into tracking its emissions and is also a member of <a href=\"https://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/\" target=\"_blank\">1% for the planet</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy kit from <a href=\"https://www.universalcolours.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Colours</a> / <a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com/brand/universal-colours\" target=\"_blank\">Sigma Sports </a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>10.

The brand is aiming to expand the use of these materials into the rest of its collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocio makes its kit in facilities which use renewable energy, primarily solar and produces clothing in small-batch quantities in order to conserve energy, limit overstock and reduce liquidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s ironic given that the bicycle can be such an environmentally friendly mode of transportation, but the industry at large, especially at the aspirational end, has pushed newer/better/faster as their primary marketing language for so long that bikes are essentially disposable,’ says Brad Sheehan, CEO and co-founder of Velocio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03003316/velocio_2_-970x539.jpeg\" alt=\"velocio_2_\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That mentality has been absorbed by consumers and it’s the main thing we hope to push back on.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s also not enough to just use recycled fabrics. We’re also looking at the manufacturing partners, fabric suppliers, and end of life phases of our apparel to see how we can improve the entire life cycle.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocio uses Bluesign and Oeko-Tex certified suppliers and is also a member of 1% for the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy kit from <a href=\"https://eu.velocio.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Velocio</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Interested in sustainability and cycling?
