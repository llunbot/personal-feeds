The encrypted messaging platform is also adding 30 new wallpaper options to help users further customize their chat experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/whatsapp-chat-themes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe new customization options let you either choose from preset themes that modify both chat bubbles and backgrounds simultaneously, or mix and match colors to create your own unique combinations. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can apply a unified theme across all your conversations and channels, but the new options mean you also have the flexibility to customize individual chats with different themes. WhatsApp notes that these customizations are visible only to the user who sets them, so personal preferences won't affect other people in the conversation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo set a default theme for all chats, navigate to Settings ➝ Chats ➝ Default chat theme. For individual chat customization, simply tap the chat name at the top of the screen. The new theme options are currently rolling out and will become available to all WhatsApp users over the next few weeks. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/whatsapp-rolls-out-chat-themes-colorful-bubbles/\">WhatsApp Rolls Out Customizable Chat Themes and Colorful Bubbles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-rolls-out-customizable-chat-themes-and-colorful-bubbles.2449362/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"542742bfd0345049878b5f68d5ee1f8581be73526da6be322a664a70586ba5bf","category":"Apple"}
