The newest version of this real-time strategy classic comes with the requisite improvements in graphics and user interface, making the whole game much easier to look at and parse at a glance. And while the updated voice acting isn't going to win any awards, neither is the stilted, bare bones dialogue that those actors are working with (which seems faithful to the original game, for better or worse).</p>\n<p>But <em>Retold</em> does add one thing that I wasn't really expecting in a modern real-time strategy gameâ€”full support for a handheld controller. Developers have been trying to make RTS games work without the traditional mouse and keyboard since the days of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1mbIXFV498\">SNES <em>Populous</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QAAWQMNuA\"><em>Starcraft 64</em></a>, usually with limited success. Microsoft hasn't given up on the dream, though, fully integrating controller support for <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> into both the PC version (which we sampled) and, obviously, the Xbox Series X|S release.</p>\n<p>The result is definitely the best version of an RTS controller interface that I've tried and proof that a modern controller can be a perfectly functional option for the genre. In the end, though, there are just a few too many annoyances associated with a handheld controller to make it the preferred way to play a game like this.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050669#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050669&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a858f49f43d42c344b3b4a583ffefe578d24b76e2ec49fe9f6d3345d6c6d7fdc","category":"Tech"}
