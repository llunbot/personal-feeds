Pu said this model will feature around a 6.6-inch display, a slimmer design, an A18 or A19 chip, 8GB of RAM, a 24-megapixel front camera, and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore specifically, display industry analyst Ross Young said this iPhone 17 model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">will have a 6.55-inch display</a>. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Plus has a 6.7-inch display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu expects the iPhone 17 Slim to have an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like the Pro models. He expects the device to have some external design changes, but he did not share any specific details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 lineup in September 2025, so some of these reported features could change.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/\">'iPhone 17 Slim' With Smaller Display Rumored to Launch Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-slim-with-smaller-display-rumored-to-launch-next-year.2425546/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d33b95d89221508ef33d2bfce5e2ff5cbbace45782a90a2d486a90c38e1d7876","category":"Apple"}
