Huge product launches went hand-in-hand with big financial trouble for some surprising names. Based on our top stories of the year though, it’s safe to say that 2023 was the year of the Transmission. Our launch story on the “end of the mountain bike drivetrain” took the top spot for the entire year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the top spots include everything from stealthy ebikes, to patent stories, to buyer’s guides, and even an op-ed (about those previously mentioned financial troubles). Check out the list of our top 23 stories of the year below!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. First Look!
