{"title":"IDC: PC Sales, Including Macs, Are Way Down From a Year Ago","link":"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50565723","date":1681426141000,"content":"\n<p>IDC:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Weak demand, excess inventory, and a worsening macroeconomic\nclimate were all contributing factors for the precipitous drop in\nshipments of traditional PCs during the first quarter of 2023\n(1Q23). Global shipments numbered 56.9 million, marking a\ncontraction of 29.0% compared to the same quarter in 2022,\naccording to preliminary results from the International Data\nCorporation (IDC) <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?containerId=IDC_P36344\">Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device\nTracker</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The preliminary results also represented a coda to the era of\nCOVID-driven demand and at least a temporary return to pre-COVID\npatterns. Shipment volume in 1Q23 was noticeably lower than the\n59.2 million units shipped in 1Q19 and 60.6 million in 1Q18.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to IDC, Windows PC sales are down about 30 percent for the first quarter, year-over-year, and Mac sales are down 40 percent. Are IDC’s numbers accurate? We should get a sense of that when Apple announces results for the January–March quarter on May 4.</p>\n\n<p>But we’ve already seen how strong the pull-forward effect from COVID and work-from-home has been: for the October–December 2022 quarter, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY23_Q1_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf\">Mac revenue was down 31 percent</a>. And most strikingly, Apple had a record-breaking quarter for Mac sales <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/10/apple-q4-2020-results-record-mac-revenue-iphone-down/\">in the July–September quarter of 2020</a> — <em>after</em> Apple had announced the transition to Apple Silicon at WWDC, but months before those much-anticipated Macs shipped. People buy new PCs when they need them, and zillions of people needed new PCs during COVID and with the post-COVID continuing transition to more work from home.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/13/idc-pc-sales-slump\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0b21a0142c0bab0ac5089aba3822d67706e0d406a8a3617a216bc58f00dbf8a5","category":"Tech"}
