This is the standard 15% discount that Apple offers on refurbished Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue is that Apple continues to offer a refurbished Mac mini with the base M2 chip, 256GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and Gigabit Ethernet <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/G16K1LL/A/refurbished-mac-mini-apple-m2-chip-with-8%E2%80%91core-cpu-and-10%E2%80%91core-gpu\">for $559</a>. This means a refurbished Mac mini with an M2 chip is currently $50 more expensive than a refurbished Mac mini with an M4 chip, despite other key specs being equal. That's a bad buy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe underlying reason for this situation is that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/entire-mac-lineup-now-at-least-16gb-ram/\">increased the minimum amount of RAM included in Macs</a> from 8GB to 16GB last year, at no additional cost. When new, the Mac mini with the M2 chip started at $799 when upgraded to 16GB of RAM, whereas the latest Mac mini now comes with 16GB of RAM by default for just $599. Apple has not revised its refurbished Mac mini prices enough to account for this difference.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-refurbished-mac-mini-pricing-problem/\">Apple's Refurbished Mac Mini Pricing Has a Problem</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-refurbished-mac-mini-pricing-has-a-problem.2449312/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4bef57c25285a1ff83a2b44857fed6017cf15645efc7be13834b0c6481ac1e5c","category":"Apple"}
