{"title":"The ‘MacBook with a modem’ dream may finally come true","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2550395/the-macbook-with-a-modem-dream-may-finally-come-true.html","date":1733761450000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no secret that Apple has been working on its own cellular modem. However, Apple hasn’t said anything about its modem development since announcing that it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233067/apple-confirms-that-it-will-acquire-most-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business.html\">bought Intel’s model division over five years ago</a>. But after rumors that the project <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157698/apple-5g-modem-scrapped-rumor.html\">might not ever happen</a>, a recent report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says the modem will finally <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2548331/apples-first-5g-modem-will-kick-off-a-3-year-plan-to-leave-qualcomm-behind.html\">debut</a> in the iPhone SE in the spring of next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The roadmap for the modem suggests it will eventually make its way into the iPad, Apple Watch, and the other iPhone models that already have modems. But it may expand beyond those obvious devices—Gurman reports that Apple is “investigating” the possibility of putting the modem inside the MacBook for the first time. It sounds like it’s likely still years away, but it’s exciting nonetheless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When on the road, MacBook users have forever been saddled with less-than-ideal options. You can tether from your iPhone if you have a supported carrier and plan or connect to a public hotspot that may or may not be secure. A 5G modem opens up a world of possibilities. In many areas, 5G speeds are just as fast or faster than public Wi-Fi, and a built-in cellular connection is inherently more secure than public Wi-Fi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Gurman, a cellular MacBook won’t happen before 2026, because Apple will use a later-generation modem that supports faster speeds. Apple’s first modem, the one that will be in the new iPhone SE, will have some performance limitations, such as no support for mmWave and a maximum speed of 4Gbps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman doesn’t report on which MacBook models will have the modem, but we can assume it will be available in at least the MacBook Pro models if not the entire line. Apple will probably take an approach that’s similar to the iPad and Apple Watch, where cellular connectivity is optional and costs extra. But for a lot of users, that extra cost will be well worth it.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"41cb7a9a896e71190ac0baa71b4ad9c77ffb6828ac5b0b1b2a9bcf746c8610a9","category":"Apple"}
