In the case of this utter, shameless, abject rip-off of Apple Weather, they’re even copying Weather’s <a href=\"https://leancrew.com/all-this/2024/06/the-unbearable-sorrow-of-apple-weather/\">semi-inscrutable (<em>semi-scrutable</em>?) daily temperature range bars</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“AI” didn’t do this. Figma did this. And they’re handing this feature to designers who trust Figma and are the ones who are going to be on the hook when they present a design that, unbeknownst to them, is a blatant rip-off of some exist app.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe now that the Adobe deal <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/18/figma-adobe-ixnay-on-the-acquisitionyay\">fell through</a>, Figma is looking to sell itself to Samsung?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/01/figma-ai-ripoff-engine\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2b6735a5e3d5fae04c0453d9aa8edf3f3ef6ae1e77c40c3df136fd79353e3928","category":"Tech"}
