Whether you’re hitting those neglected urban streets, rough backroads, or sneaking in some trail time on the commute, you’ll have plenty of traction and support with these tires. And, they’re puncture resistant, so you’re less likely to be slowed down by a flat tire.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5.jpg\" alt=\"aventon sinch folding e-bike with fat tires and compact frame shown from rear with closeup on motor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5.jpg 1000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5-800x800.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/09132335/aventon-sinch-folding-e-bike-with-fat-tires-5-125x125.jpg 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=a41b063c-52a4-4d87-8f09-d6c71998ed15&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aventon.com%2Fproducts%2Faventon-sinch-foldable-electric-bike&amp;ctc=brspoutdoorbikingaventonsinch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sinch</a> has a 7-speed drivetrain, giving you just enough gear range when combined with the motor’s assist.
