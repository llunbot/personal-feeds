That could play an interesting role in the positioning battle at the end of the day, but it’s unlikely to have much of a bigger impact than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for</strong>: Sprinters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks</strong>: <em>The way I see it, there are four top contenders for the sprints in this race, along with a handful of outsiders. Arnaud Démare, Fabio Jakobsen, Jasper Philipsen, and Michael Matthews stand out as the most obvious candidates to win the bunch kicks, and I like Démare and Jakobsen in particular for this stage. Juan Sebastián Molano and Magnus Cort are other fast finishers to keep an eye on.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6dad9a-1340x576.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/d2ee8.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-2-of-the-vuelta-a-espana/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2f79e6a23f837bd259deb5626cb4fb5aabcc31c16b95eaec1a696322ed1dc80e","category":"Cycling"}
