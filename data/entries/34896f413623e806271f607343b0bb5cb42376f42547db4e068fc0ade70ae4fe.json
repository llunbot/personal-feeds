Once there, the satellite linked up with an Internet gateway in Utah and communicated with multiple user terminals in Alaska, where Astranis will provide high-speed bandwidth to an Internet service provider, Pacific Dataport.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941623#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941623&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34896f413623e806271f607343b0bb5cb42376f42547db4e068fc0ade70ae4fe","category":"Tech"}
