It accuses the world’s biggest online retailer of\nat least misleading Congress and possibly outright lying.</p>\n\n<p>It cites recent media reports detailing Amazon’s alleged practice\nof undercutting the businesses that sell on its platform by making\n“knock-offs,” or very similar products, and boosting their\npresence on the site.</p>\n\n<p>The reports directly contradict the sworn testimony of Amazon\nexecutives and other statements to Congress, the letter says. It\nwas signed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,\nand the Democratic and Republican leaders of the antitrust panel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One report that prompted this is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/\">this one last week from Reuters reporters Aditya Kalra and Steve Stecklow</a>, regarding Amazon’s knock-off product strategy in India:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents examined by\nReuters — including emails, strategy papers and business plans — show the company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs\nand manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in\nIndia, one of the company’s largest growth markets.</p>\n\n<p>The documents reveal how Amazon’s private-brands team in India\nsecretly exploited internal data from Amazon.in to copy products\nsold by other companies, and then offered them on its platform.\nThe employees also stoked sales of Amazon private-brand products\nby rigging Amazon’s search results so that the company’s products\nwould appear, as one 2016 strategy report for India put it, “in\nthe first 2 or three … search results” when customers were\nshopping on Amazon.in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a good argument for Amazon on this front that store brands are as old as retail. That <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/house-kits-drugs-and-drills-all-the-ways-sears-was-amazon-before-amazon-2018-10-10\">Sears did the same thing a century ago</a>, and that Walmart does it now. And that of course retailers with house brands — including Amazon — look at sales data to choose what to make. But that’s not what Amazon — <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/29/bezos-testimony-data-antitrust/\">and Jeff Bezos in particular</a> — have said under oath. Bezos left Jassy with a serious mess to clean up here.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/19/bezos-jassy-mess\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7acfb3dcfb76c0a32171a937877d387bdead0c267d98261e382fdfc7ba41dbca","category":"Tech"}
