But within hours of launch, the Peregrine spacecraft developed a propellant leak in its propulsion system. Although the Astrobotic engineering team fought valiantly, they could not control the leak long enough to attempt a lunar landing. Instead, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/on-its-first-mission-astrobotic-missed-the-moon-but-learned-a-lot/\">operators returned it to Earth's atmosphere</a>, where it burned up.</p>\n<p>This immediately raised questions about Astrobotic's next mission. Its second spacecraft, Griffin, would be larger. The company had received a large \"task order\" from NASA to use this lander to deliver the VIPER robotic rover to the south pole of the Moon in 2025 worth more than $300 million. However, NASA officials were concerned that, after Peregrine's problems, the significantly more ambitious Griffin lander might fail.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/after-a-wrenching-decision-by-nasa-private-lunar-lander-finds-a-new-customer/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/after-a-wrenching-decision-by-nasa-private-lunar-lander-finds-a-new-customer/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c013a9b603ab6468c8273f48513628b466be6f48e02fe07cb12c9c717f61b546","category":"Tech"}
