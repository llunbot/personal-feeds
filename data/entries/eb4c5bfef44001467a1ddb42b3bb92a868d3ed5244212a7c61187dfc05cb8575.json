Now it’ll work on any ride, regardless of whether you are following a route.</p>\n<p>The software update brings Wahoo’s climbing tool up to speed with many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">best bike computers</a>.</p>\n<p>Hammerhead’s Climber feature was the first to preview hills without needing a route, launching on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/cycle-computers/hammerhead-karoo-2-bike-computer-review/\">Karoo 2</a> in 2022.</p>\n<p>More recently, Garmin introduced on-the-fly climb detection via ClimbPro 2.0 on its new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/garmin-edge-840-solar/\">Edge 540 and 840 computers</a>.</p>\n<h2>How does Summit Freeride work?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gradient updates are split into colour-coded 10m chunks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wahoo</i></span></div>\n<p>Wahoo says Summit Freeride harnesses the pre-installed map and elevation data on its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/cycle-computers/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-v2-review/\">Elemnt Bolt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/wahoo-elemnt-roam-v2-review/\">Elemnt Roam</a> computers. It scans the road ahead to anticipate and notify the rider of upcoming climbs.</p>\n<p>Once a climb is detected, Summit Freeride adds it to the device’s upcoming climb list. On the map page, chevrons will indicate the climb’s position and steepness.</p>\n<p>During ascents, the software displays the remaining elevation, gradient, time, and distance to the summit.</p>\n<p>The climb profile is broken down into coloured-coded, 10m sections with darker shades indicating steeper gradients. Wahoo says this should help users to better pace their climbing efforts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An upcoming climb is signalled by chevrons.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The fitness brand claims that Summit Freeride will recalculate if a rider turns off a climb, onto a different road, and continues ascending.</p>\n<p>Wahoo says Summit Freeride’s minimum criteria for a climb is 400m long at an average gradient of three per cent, or 250m long with an average incline of seven per cent.</p>\n<p>Users can configure the categories of climbs they want to see in the Elemnt app.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Summit Freeride adds to data-dense Wahoo screens.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wahoo</i></span></div>\n<p>It is also possible to sort climbs by difficulty during a ride. Wahoo claims this will help riders hold back something for tough hills to come.</p>\n<p>The incoming climb alert will come up even when riders are locked into another data screen, such as the workout or map screen, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>Summit Freeride is available to use now on the latest versions of the Elemnt Roam and Elemnt Bolt.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"eb4c5bfef44001467a1ddb42b3bb92a868d3ed5244212a7c61187dfc05cb8575","category":"Cycling"}
