Most planetary bodies in our Solar System wouldn't exhibit so much change in a couple of decades.</p>\n<p>But Io is different, with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/08/three-massive-volcanic-eruptions-light-up-jupiters-moon-io/\">volcanic eruptions regularly remaking</a> parts of the moon's crust. That means there's a good chance something on Io has changed since NASA's Galileo orbiter last encountered it in 2002.</p>\n<p>NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft is delivering the fresh data on Io with a series of flybys, each getting closer to Jupiter's volcanic moon until a pair of close-up encounters at a range of less than 1,000 miles (about 1,500 kilometers) in December and February.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959995#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959995&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2d08969f35e361721a6f97e943561d5ad3102e704095726f01611bdc4f02da0b","category":"Tech"}
