Initially the new technology was called audio\nblogging, but eventually a British journalist came up with the\nterm “podcasting” and it stuck.</p>\n\n<p>So Dave was present at the creation of some cool stuff, but it was\nblogging that brought him to a wider public. “Some people were\nborn to play country music,” <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=about\">he wrote</a> at one stage. “I was\nborn to blog. At the beginning of blogging I thought everyone\nwould be a blogger. I was wrong. Most people don’t have the\nimpulse to say what they think.” Dave was the exact opposite. He\nwas (and remains) articulate and forthright. His formidable record\nas a tech innovator meant that he couldn’t be written off as a\ncrank. The fact that he was financially secure meant that he\ndidn’t have to suck up to anyone: he could speak his mind. And he\ndid. So from the moment he launched Scripting News in October 1994\nhe was a distinctive presence on the web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of Winer’s <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=about\">numerous aphorisms</a> that resonates deeply with me: <em>People return to places that send them away.</em></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/07/naughton-winer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"12a592d5669f49c8daa2bfac461ee860ac3c90c4378835f319196b2446e3e6e0","category":"Tech"}
