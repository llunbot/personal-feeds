Just. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/tesla-sales-and-production-slumped-heavily-in-q1-2025/\">Earlier this month</a> the automaker reported double-digit declines in both production and delivery numbers thanks to the impact of CEO Elon Musk's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-says-elon-musk-will-lead-doge-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency/\">central role</a> in the Trump administration, a global trade war, and an increasingly outdated and tiny product lineup.
