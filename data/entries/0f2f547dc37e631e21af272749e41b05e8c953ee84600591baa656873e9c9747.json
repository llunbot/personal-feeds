No other details about Apple's legal challenge have been made public, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/apple-files-legal-challenge-eus-digital-markets-act-2023-11-17/\">Reuters reported</a>. But last week, sources <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-10/apple-to-appeal-digital-markets-act-over-app-store-at-eu-court\">told Bloomberg</a> that Apple's appeal was expected to oppose gatekeeper status of its App Store, iOS operating system, and Safari browser. That report, however, noted that sources had only seen a draft of the appeal, which could have been edited ahead of filing.</p>\n<p>Apple had previously <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100013_215.pdf\">argued</a> that its App Store could be considered not one software application marketplace, but five distinct marketplaces offered across five devices: iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches. Following this logic, only the iOS App Store should be considered a gatekeeper, Apple argued. Ultimately, the EU disagreed, saying that the \"nature, function, and usage of the different devices on which the App Store can be accessed\" does not \"alter the common purpose the App Store serves across all Apple's devices.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984413#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984413&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0f2f547dc37e631e21af272749e41b05e8c953ee84600591baa656873e9c9747","category":"Tech"}
