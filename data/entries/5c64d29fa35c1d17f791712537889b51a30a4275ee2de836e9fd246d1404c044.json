Google says that Google ‌Photos‌ users can ask all sorts of questions to find content from their image libraries, with the feature able to search through all of a person's Google ‌Photos‌ images to bring up relevant results. Some examples:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>What are the best photos from each national park I visited?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Where did I camp last year?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>When do my tickets expire?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What were the best things we saw on our trip?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What did I eat at the hotel in [location]?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What did I eat at the market in Thailand?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What are the best photos from the birthday party?</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>What themes have we had for family birthday parties?</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nAsk ‌Photos‌ is able to understand the context and subject of photos to provide answers to questions. With the last question listed above, for example, Ask ‌Photos‌ can see what decorations are in the background of an image or on a birthday cake to answer the query.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature can be used to curate the best images taken on a trip, saving editing time. It can also provide trip highlights, and suggest top pictures complete with captions to share on social media.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle says that personal data in Google ‌Photos‌ isn't used for ads, but some queries will be reviewed by humans to improve the feature. Data will not be linked to a Google Account for privacy protection purposes. Answers provided by Ask ‌Photos‌, including photos and videos, are not reviewed by humans unless feedback is provided or in rare cases to address abuse or harm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAsk ‌Photos‌ was already previewed at Google I/O, but it has now started rolling out, with Google providing early access to select iOS and Android Google ‌Photos‌ users.
