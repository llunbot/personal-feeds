choosing a pair of headphones for cycling, safety is the most important factor. </span></p>\n<p><span>For this reason, on-ear or traditional in-ear headphones are rarely a good option because they reduce your ability to hear noise from the world around you.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, there are now many bone conduction and open-ear air conduction headphones on the market that leave your ear canal free to receive ambient noise. </span></p>\n<p><span>Bone conduction headphones work by transmitting sound waves through the bones of your skull, while air conduction headphones transmit the sound a short distance through the air to your ear drum.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bone conduction designs are less likely to cause hearing damage, auditory fatigue and ear hygiene issues.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, because they leave your ears entirely open, they may struggle to compete with louder ambient noise and deliver a rich, balanced listening experience when you’re cycling.</span></p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bone

Others, such as the Jabra Elite 7 Actives, employ an in-built microphone to pick up ambient noise. </span></p>\n<p><span>Whether you choose air conduction or bone conduction headphones, be sure to opt for something with a secure fit – ear hooks that loop around the top of your ear, or fins that sit beneath your ear grooves, help here.</span></p>\n<p><span>Most bone conduction headphones are more likely to stay in place throughout vigorous efforts, with some using a band that fits around your neck for a secure fit.</span></p>\n<h3>What are the best headphones for Zwift and indoor training?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rapha indoor training kit\" title=\"Rapha indoor training kit\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A secure fit is less of a deciding factor when choosing headphones for indoor training.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rapha</i></span></div>\n<p><span>If you already have a set of headphones for cycling outdoors, these will almost certainly be fine for </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\"><span>indoor training</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span>Cycling indoors is less dynamic than outdoor cycling, so you’ll have fewer problems with headphone security. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, cycling indoors can be very sweaty. If you’re a profuse perspirer and find it hard to keep headphones in place while riding outside, the issue will be exacerbated indoors. </span></p>\n<p><span>You could consider placing a sweatband over your ears, though we’d argue that points to a more fundamental issue with the headphones and suggest considering another option. </span></p>\n<p><span>You probably won’t be wearing a helmet while indoor training. </span><span>This means you can wear a pair of over-ear headphones for the best audio quality possible. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some riders like to chat, usually on a Discord server, while grinding away through a </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/60-minute-turbo-training-sessions/\"><span>turbo session</span></a><span> or </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/zwift-racing/\"><span>Zwift racing</span></a><span>.
