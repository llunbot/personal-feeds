The rumor was also shared by \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1693955082134372418?s=20\">Majin Bu</a>,\" who added that the new cables should be much more durable. The longer cable will presumably necessitate redesigned packaging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Lightning cable packed with current ‌iPhone‌ models is rubberized, white, and just one meter in length. The new braided cables are expected to come in black, white, yellow, blue, and orange, at minimum, mirroring a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/five-iphone-15-color-options-to-expect/\">new selection of color options</a> for the ‌iPhone 15‌ series.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-longer/\">iPhone 15's Braided USB-C Cable Could Be 50% Longer</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-50-longer.2399312/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b3c89f77b9b91a02ece32b328320cc6516e9d1081eb1d36998d23f9cb7b5b5e8","category":"Apple"}
