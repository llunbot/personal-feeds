Both brakes use CNC’d aluminium with anodised finishing – though the Clarks brakes are only available in black.</p>\n<p>CNC machining removes layers from a block of metal, carving out the component. It is an alternative to forging, where molten metal is poured into dies to create components.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The levers have a somewhat Trickstuff appearance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Clarks has designed the lever blades to fit two fingers, though most riders will prefer to use just one.</p>\n<p>The lever blades are aggressively shaped, with the ends flaring outward to stop your fingers from slipping off. They also feature cut-outs for weight savings, with the CSR C4 having a perforated leading edge for extra grip.</p>\n<h2>Reach adjust</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Only the CRS C4 lever has tool-free reach adjust.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Both brakes allow for lever adjustment, with the CSR C2 using a 2mm Allen key placed on the lever’s blade to bring the blade closer to the bar.</p>\n<p>The CSR C4 uses a small thumb screw for tool-free adjustment, though a 2mm hex bolt is hidden within for tool adjustment.</p>\n<p>A split clamp is used to attach the lever to the bar, which looks to make the brakes easy to push onto the bars.</p>\n<p>The clamp has gnarled contact points where it grips the bars to ensure the brakes stay in place.</p>\n<p>Clarks says it has decided to use <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/brake-fluid-mineral-oil-vs-dot/\">mineral oil instead of DOT fluid</a> for its brakes because it’s less harmful to the environment.</p>\n<p>Shimano uses mineral oil in its hydraulic brakes for similar reasons, because mineral oil doesn’t carry the risk of damaging your skin when working on your brakes, unlike DOT fluid.</p>\n<h2>Performance pistons</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Brakes, cables and rotors are all included in the price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The calipers are post-mounted and have self-adjusting pistons, with the CSR C2 using two 22mm steel pistons, and the CSR C4 using four 14mm steel pistons.</p>\n<p>Both brakes appear to use Shimano brake pads, which should make finding spares easier than having proprietary pads.</p>\n<p>Similar to Shimano’s high-end <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">mountain bike brakes</a>, the CSR C4 uses cooling fin pads to disperse heat generated through braking.</p>\n<p>The pads are held in place by a 3mm Allen key, which sits flush with the caliper once screwed in.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s unusual to see floating rotors at this price point.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The brakes come with floating rotors that feature aluminium inners connected to a steel braking band. The rotors are available in 160mm, 180mm and 203mm sizes.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c1eaa618a6f7bd32431960409862701b0f7c0d367ee5630ffa97b256a35a32f7","category":"Cycling"}
