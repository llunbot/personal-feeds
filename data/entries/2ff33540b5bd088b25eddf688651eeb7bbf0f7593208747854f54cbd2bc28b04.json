We're up to version six now! Both foldables have had renders posted recently from OnLeaks and Smartprix. These are usually based on CAD files passed around to accessory makers, so they should be spatially accurate down to the millimeter, with some guesses as to the colors, materials, and a few small details.</p>\n<p>First up, we have the big foldable, the <a href=\"https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-say-hello-to-boxy-aesthetics/\">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. This year, the device is getting a boxier design with sharper screen and body corners, making it more in line with the S24 Ultra. The dimensions of what a foldable should be is still something no one can seem <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/\">to agree on</a>, and the report says the Z Fold 6 is \"1.4 mm shorter and 2.6 mm wider\" than the Fold 5. The body has the same thickness as last year, 6.1 mm when open, but that doesn't say how much thickness the hinge adds. (The Fold 5 is 13.4 mm when folded.)</p>\n<p>The flat sides in the render look great, making the Z Fold look even more book-like than normal. There are three cameras on the back, a hole-punch camera on the front cover screen, and an under-screen camera on the inside. What would help the Z Fold keep pace with the competition is a big battery upgrade: The Z Fold 5 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/samsung-makes-the-galaxy-z-fold-5-and-z-flip-5-official/\">was thicker</a> than the competition yet only packed a 4400 mAh battery. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/\">Pixel Fold</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/the-honor-magic-v2-is-the-thinnest-foldable-smartphone-ever/\">Honor Magic V2</a> both shipped with a 5000 mAh battery.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006943#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006943&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2ff33540b5bd088b25eddf688651eeb7bbf0f7593208747854f54cbd2bc28b04","category":"Tech"}
