{"title":"CES 2024: Satechi Debuts New Qi2 Wireless Charging Stands","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-satechi-qi2-chargers/","date":1704819600000,"content":"<a href=\"https://satechi.net\">Satechi</a> today introduced two new Qi2 charging options, including the 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand and 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand. With next-generation Qi2 charging technology, Satechi's chargers are able to charge <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> iPhones at up to 15W, the same as official ‌MagSafe‌ chargers from Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/satechi-3-in-1-charger.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe 3-in-1 stand from Satechi also includes a 5W Apple Watch charger and a 5W wireless charger that's designed for the AirPods, while the 2-in-1 stand has a spot for charging the AirPods. Both chargers feature a vegan leather base, an aluminum housing, and a soft silicone charging puck, and they are able to fold down for travel when not in use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSatechi's 3-in-1 stand is able to provide fast-charging capabilities for the Apple Watch Series 7 and later, plus it comes with a 45W USB-C power adapter. Qi2 uses the same magnetic power profile as ‌MagSafe‌, so these stands work like ‌MagSafe‌ stands without the 7.5W limitation of the prior Qi standard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/satechi-2-in-1-charger.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand will be priced at $130, while the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand will be priced at $80.
