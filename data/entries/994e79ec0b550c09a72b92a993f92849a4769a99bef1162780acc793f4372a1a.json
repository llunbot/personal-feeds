If an app tries to access either device upon launching or after a button tap, you'll get a notice saying, \"Your mic is muted by your system settings,\" with a prompt to click the button to learn more (at least in Google Meet). The setting is coming \"later this year.\"</p>\n<p>Having a default-off option for Chromebooks adds security to an already fairly secure platform, both by obscurity and design. It's also helpful for users, as it's a good idea to have to affirmatively enable a camera every time it wants to turn on rather than remembering whether or not you previously gave permission to Zoom, Meet, Slack, Skype, Teams, GoToMeeting, WebEx, Discord, or other apps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934169#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934169&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"994e79ec0b550c09a72b92a993f92849a4769a99bef1162780acc793f4372a1a","category":"Tech"}
