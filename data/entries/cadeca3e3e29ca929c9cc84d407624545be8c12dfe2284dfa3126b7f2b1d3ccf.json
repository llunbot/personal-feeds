The move was designed to permit resets when users didn’t have access to the email address used to establish the account. In January, GitLab <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/11/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-7-2-released/\">disclosed</a> that the feature allowed attackers to send reset emails to accounts they controlled and from there click on the embedded link and take over the account.</p>\n<p>While exploits required no user interaction, hijackings worked only against accounts that weren’t configured to use multi-factor authentication. Even with MFA, accounts remained vulnerable to password resets. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-7028, carries a severity rating of 10 out of a possible 10.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021409#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021409&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cadeca3e3e29ca929c9cc84d407624545be8c12dfe2284dfa3126b7f2b1d3ccf","category":"Tech"}
