Basically, Google plans to eventually, someday, release a text bot that will do all the writing for you. It can reply to emails and make presentations with just a text prompt.

Google's blog post backs this up by framing this announcement as part of a larger plan, saying, \"To start, we’re introducing a first set of AI-powered writing features in Docs and Gmail.\" So far, the company has also promised to put AI into its <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-14/google-to-integrate-artificial-intelligence-into-health-care-services-products?srnd=technology-vp#xj4y7vzkg\">health care offerings</a> and opened up API access to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/14/23639313/google-ai-language-model-palm-api-challenge-openai\">a language model</a>, but we've yet to see a real consumer product launch.</p>\n<p>The company says it's building a \"collaborative AI partner\" into Workspace and has a breakdown of the future features:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923840#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923840&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c271e470662b73fe849ee2fb062694fdb3eb2bfbd737acde51357e9c1083a67a","category":"Tech"}
