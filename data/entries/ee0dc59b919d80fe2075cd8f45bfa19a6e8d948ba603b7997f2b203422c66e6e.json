NASA officials <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/\">decided it was too risky</a> to put the astronauts on Starliner after the spacecraft suffered thruster failures during its flight to the space station in early June.</p>\n<p>Instead, Wilmore and Williams will come home on a SpaceX Dragon capsule no earlier than February, extending their planned stay on the space station from eight days to eight months. Flying on autopilot, the Starliner spacecraft is scheduled to depart the station at approximately 6:04 pm EDT (22:04 UTC) on September 6. The capsule will fire its engines to drop out of orbit and target a parachute-assisted landing in New Mexico at 12:03 am EDT (04:03 UTC) on September 7, NASA said in a statement Thursday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046474#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046474&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ee0dc59b919d80fe2075cd8f45bfa19a6e8d948ba603b7997f2b203422c66e6e","category":"Tech"}
