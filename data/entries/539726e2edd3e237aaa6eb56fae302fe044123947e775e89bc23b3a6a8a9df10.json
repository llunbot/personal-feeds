That \"at some point\" future has fully arrived this week with Nvidia's <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/rtx-remix-open-beta-half-life-2-rtx-trailer/\">open beta launch of its RTX Remix modding tools</a>.</p>\n<p>This isn't the wider modding community's first taste of RTX Remix's upscaling and lighting tools. Nvidia released an <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-runtime-open-source-download/\">alpha version of the RTX runtime</a> last April, offering \"capture and replacement\" modules that could upgrade older game assets and add modern graphical features like DLSS3 at playback. ModDBÂ <a href=\"https://www.moddb.com/rtx/\">lists dozens of older games</a> with an RTX.conf file that offers some level of RTX-powered graphical enhancement.</p>\n<p>But this week's official open beta launch gives \"experienced modders\" new tools to easily create and insert these kinds of updated graphical effects and models in classic titles. That includes \"generative AI texture tools\" that Nvidia <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-open-beta-qa-with-nyle-usmani-past-present-and-future-of-the-generalized-modding-platform/\">says</a> use \"our own proprietary model trained on our in-house dataset\" to automatically upscale low-res textures to up to four times the original resolution. It also means the ability to add \"physically accurate dynamic lights\" that work with ray-tracing-capable hardware and a variety of open source models and material maps for modders to play with.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998580#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998580&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"539726e2edd3e237aaa6eb56fae302fe044123947e775e89bc23b3a6a8a9df10","category":"Tech"}
