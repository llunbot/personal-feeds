The best time of year is when the big sales happen, such as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/best-ipad-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-2024.html\">Black Friday</a> in November or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2387154/best-ipad-prime-day-deals-october-2024.html\">Amazon Prime Day sales</a> in July and October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also wise to check to see if Apple is likely to update the iPad you want to buy soon. When Apple updates an iPad you can expect deal prices of the previous generation models to fall, if it’s a deal on the newest model you want, be prepared to wait though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know when to expect the iPad Pro M5?

While Apple will sometimes offer vouchers as an incentive to buy a new iPad (that’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Apple’s usual Black Friday giveaway</a>), the company never discounts prices. Apple does sell refurbished iPads at a lower price though, so that might be something to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a student you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">take advantage of Apple’s education discounts</a> and save a little money on the full price of iPads (and Macs). And in the summer months Apple gives away either vouchers or AirPods with the sale of certain iPads (and Macs) to students in it’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">Higher Education Sale</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-Back-To-School-Sale.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Back to School Sale\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Sometimes Apple gives away vouchers in a Back To School sale. </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>How Macworld finds the best deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Macworld, we have tools at our disposal that mean we can see the best deals at any time across multiple resellers. We also track the best discounts over time, so we know what the best deals look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also know what pitfalls to avoid when looking for an iPad deal. For example, an older iPad model may have an attractive price, but the saving may not be good enough to compensate for what’s missing if you compare it to a newer model. We will be sure to indicate when this may be the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we know all about Apple’s iPad line up right now, what the previous generations offered, and what’s expected from the iPad in the future, we are well placed to give advice on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670670/which-ipad-best.html\">best iPad to buy</a> and the best price to get it for. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ipadKollektion2025_145d6b.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPads 2025\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple </p></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Macworld’s top 5 tips for finding the best iPad deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are searching for a deal keep the following points in mind and you should be happy with your purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Check the storage: </strong>Some older iPads only had 32GB or 64GB storage. We don’t think that’s enough. The good news is that Apple’s current iPad line up has 128GB storage or more, so, unless you are buying an older model, this won’t be an issue. Just make sure that if you see a deal on an old model with less storage it is priced accordingly. Some of the best deals are on higher capacity iPads.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You probably don’t need cellular: </strong>You might intend to use your iPad when you are out and about. In that case spending more to get a model with cellular might appeal. Our opinion is that you can just hotspot from your iPhone to get on the internet from your iPad. You won’t need to pay for a data contract and your’ll also save yourself money on the price of the iPad itself. Check the deal you are looking at isn’t for a cellular model because a non-cellular deal will be even better!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider refurbished: </strong>If you want a bargain and don’t mind that it’s not the latest model buying a refurbished iPad can be a great way to save money. We recommend using <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> because every product is throughly tested before being sold, and you get a one year warranty with it. If you want to save more money, companies like <a href=\"https://www.backmarket.com/\">BackMarket</a> and <a href=\"https://www.decluttr.com/\">Declutter</a>. There’s more information about buying a refurbished iPad below. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shop around: </strong>If you want a deal then don’t shop at Apple! The best deals come from the various resellers who often battle it our to undercut each others prices for Apple products. Amazon is usually the best, but make sure to check the likes of Walmart, B&amp;H and Best Buy in the U.S., and AO, Argos, Currys in the U.K. We have a list of the best places to buy an iPad below. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wait, if you can:</strong> If it’s not Black Friday or an Amazon Prime Sale keep in mind that there could be even better bargains coming. Also, if Apple is likely to be announcing new products soon, be aware that it may mean that the current range will soon be discounted even more.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Which iPad should you buy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer to this question really depends on what you need your iPad for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I want the cheapest iPad you can buy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the standard iPad. The cheapest iPad is the 128GB A16 iPad, which costs from $349 / £329. It’s a good option if you are likely your iPad is destined for general use, such as emails, one taking, web browsing, social networks, watching movies and reading books. It’s got a great sized screen and is light enough to pop in a bag and not feel weighed down.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-iPad-A16-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple iPad A16 1\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The iPad A16</figcaption></figure><p>Britta O’Boyle</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>I’m for an iPad to use instead of a computer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are just planning to edit documents and spreadsheets, any iPad can be a good supplement for a computer. If you need something with a little more power then the iPad Air or iPad Pro might be a better option. Apple and other companies sell iPad cases that come with built in keyboards, so you can turn your iPad into a laptop. Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668400/best-ipad-keyboards.html\">round up of the best iPad keyboards</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mokibo-Fusion-Keyboard-For-iPad-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mokibo Fusion Keyboard For iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>I want an iPad that won’t weigh too much</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You have two choices here. The iPad mini is the lightest iPad you can get, it’s also the smallest. If you need a bigger screen the iPad Air is a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/iPad-Mini-7-2024-Review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Mini 7 2024 Review\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>I want an iPad to use for gaming</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are wanting to play the latest games on your iPad then the iPad Pro may be the one to choose. Other iPads will be able to play casual games, but to be sure of getting the power and graphics prowess necessary to play the latest games. The iPad Pro also offers a better screen with the 120Hz refresh rates that serious gamers will want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I want an iPad so I can draw</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad is a great device for artists. Any iPad, accompanied with an Apple Pencil or other iPad stylus, will allow you to draw using an app such as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/adobe-fresco-draw-paint/id1458660369\">Adobe’s Sketchpad (now called Adobe Fresco)</a> which can be used for free, but has in-app purchases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are really serious about your art you may prefer an iPad Pro though, and you may even consider the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674909/what-is-nano-texture-glass-and-do-i-need-it.html\">nano-texture display option for less glare and reflections</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3278.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Pro M4 med Apple Pencil\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We also round up the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668914/best-ipad-for-students.html\">best iPad for students</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668916/best-kids-ipad.html\">best iPad for kids</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678457/which-is-the-best-ipad-for-seniors.html\">best iPad for the elderly</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Where to get an iPad deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to buy directly from Apple.

Apple does, however, sell reconditioned iPads in its Certified Refurbished store. So you might be able to grab a bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPads in Apple’s refurbished store may be ex-display stock, or they may have been returned to Apple due to a fault, but they are fully reconditioned now and come with a full year’s warranty. It’s not like buying secondhand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. refurbished store has a selection that includes: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Air (4th generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>11-inch iPad Pro (2nd and 3rd generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12.9-inch iPad Pro (4th and 5th generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (5th and 6th generation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the original price, you can save as much as $320 on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. </p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad\" target=\"_blank\">Get a refurbished iPad at Apple's refurbished store (U.S.)</a></div>\n\n\n<p>In the U.K. you’ll find a similar selection of iPads available from Apple’s refurbished store. You’ll find the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Air (5th generation and M2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (6th generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>11-inch iPad Pro (2nd generation, 3rd generation, 4th generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12.9-inch iPad Pro (4th generation, 5th generation, 6th generation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are savings of £480 on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compared to the original price. </p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/ipad\" target=\"_blank\">Get a refurbished iPad at Apple's refurbished store (U.K.)</a></div>\n\n\n<p>Another place to look is <a href=\"https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/l/apple-ipad/f78ae8f5-4611-4ad0-b2ad-ced07765b847\" target=\"_blank\">BackMarket US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.backmarket.co.uk/en-gb/l/ipad/6053d9e8-2eaa-4971-9b6e-79b8a16e4dee\" target=\"_blank\">BackMarket UK</a>, which sells refurbished Macs and other Apple products. Amazon also has a certified refurbished store for Apple products, but we would advise against buying any products that are older than five years.
