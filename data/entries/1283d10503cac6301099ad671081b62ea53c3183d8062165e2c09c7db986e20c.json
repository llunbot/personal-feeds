More batteries, for oneâ€”tight supplies mean automakers can only build enough EVs to satisfy some of the pent-up demand. Cheaper EVs would be helpful, too, considering that by the end of 2022 the average cost of a new EV was more than $61,000. And <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/\">charging infrastructure</a> needs to improve, too. Now, a new mobile EV charger called Ziggy might help with that last one.</p>\n<p>Installing EV chargers usually isn't too difficult if you're a homeowner with a garage or carport, but things can get more complicated for multifamily dwellings and commercial parking premises. Permitting is often a big problem, and there can also be lengthy waits to get electrical infrastructure upgraded, particularly if the plan is to install level 3 DC fast chargers, which can suck up 100s of kWs of electricity from the grid.</p>\n<p>Ziggy is the work of the company <a href=\"https://evsafecharge.com\">EV Charge Safe</a>, and it flips the idea of EV charging on its head. Instead of a driver parking by the EV charger, Ziggy is mobile and can come to the car instead.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942891#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942891&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
