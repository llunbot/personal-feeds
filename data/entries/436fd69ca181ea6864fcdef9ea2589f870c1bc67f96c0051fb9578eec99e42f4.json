The battery pack and car mounts will be available to order later this year on Mophie.com and at select retail stores worldwide, while the stand will be available in the first quarter of 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nQi2 is based on the MagSafe standard that Apple introduced with the iPhone 12. However, accessories that support Qi2 are not required to use Apple's official MagSafe module or be certified under Apple's Made for iPhone program, which should effectively result in availability of more affordable MagSafe accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/25/iphone-15-expected-to-support-qi2/\">support both Qi2 and MagSafe</a>, according to ChargerLAB, a reliable source of charging-related information. Qi2 accessories will likely be able to charge iPhone 15 models at up to 15W, just like official MagSafe accessories. First-generation Qi chargers are limited to 7.5W charging speeds on current iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 15 series during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">September 12 event</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mophie/\">Mophie</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/mophie-unveils-qi2-accessories/\">Mophie Unveils Qi2 Accessories With 15W Charging Ahead of iPhone 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mophie-unveils-qi2-accessories-with-15w-charging-ahead-of-iphone-15.2400228/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"436fd69ca181ea6864fcdef9ea2589f870c1bc67f96c0051fb9578eec99e42f4","category":"Apple"}
