Simply unclip the chest strap and pull down the shorts for a comfort break.</p>\n<p>At just under six foot, I often have my doubts about these neat little comfort break tricks but in these bib shorts I had no issues as the fabric is amply stretchy.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img

lightweight bib shorts give gentle compression and have raw edge cut straps and leg openings.</p>\n<p>This can make the shorts feel a little flimsy but once riding I found it works well and I felt no bulges or digging in.</p>\n<p>The raw cut finish gives a flattering look and there are 5cm wide silicone grippers to keep the leg ends in place.</p>\n<p>That said, in my view a smidge more compression would be an asset for a securer fit as I felt the shorts rode up on some rides.</p>\n<p>That may well be my height though, as the length of the shorts is shorter than I would like, but if you are below six foot this shouldn’t be an issue.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img

choose them for a really hot day.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I also wore them to a spin class and that wasn’t the brightest idea.</p>\n<p>The shorts’ design is subtle, with reflective strips at the rear of each leg and reflective logo higher up on either side.</p>\n<p>They could be paired with the Pactimo Alpine Thermal LS Jersey for a comfortable long distance autumn ride.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img

Bib Shorts bottom line</h2>\n<p>Overall, a great pair of lightweight shorts with a useful comfort break feature and very comfortable chamois, making them ideal for long distance training.</p>\n<p>At £165, they are at the premium end of the market but are £10 less than the <a href=\"/reviews/8369/assos-dyora-rs-summer-bibshorts-and-rs-short-sleeve-jersey-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">Assos Dyora RS Summer bib shorts</a>.</p>\n<p>However at the time of writing, these shorts are on sale for £82, an absolute steal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a
