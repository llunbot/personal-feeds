The high-end chip is available in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/\">new Mac Studio</a>, introduced earlier this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M4-Max-and-M3-Ultra.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nApple said the M3 Ultra chip is the \"highest-performing chip it has ever created,\" and the unverified benchmark result seems to confirm that. In the single result, the 32-core M3 Ultra chip achieved a multi-core CPU score of 27,749, which makes it around 8% faster than the 16-core M4 Max chip that previously held the performance record. The result also reveals that the M3 Ultra chip is up to 30% faster than the 24-core M2 Ultra chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs expected, the M4 Max chip tops the M3 Ultra chip in terms of single-core CPU performance by nearly 20%, according to the result.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe now await additional M3 Ultra benchmark results to see if these scores are accurate, as they seem to be on the lower side compared to what was expected. For example, Apple advertised the M3 Ultra chip as being up to 1.5x faster than the M2 Ultra chip, so that 30% increase mentioned above should seemingly be closer to the 50% mark. Apple never said how the M3 Ultra chip's performance compares to the M4 Max chip, though.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs always, real-world performance may vary somewhat, but synthetic benchmark tools like Geekbench 6 provide a useful baseline for comparisons.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWatch this space, as we would not be surprised if additional Geekbench 6 results for the M3 Ultra chip end up having higher performance scores.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe benchmark was <a href=\"https://x.com/jimmyjames_tech/status/1897847411050955010\">spotted by @jimmyjames_tech</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/VadimYuryev/status/1897849477706481701\">shared by Vadim Yuryev</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/\">Benchmarks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/m3-ultra-chip-first-benchmark-result/\">M3 Ultra Chip Isn't Much Faster Than M4 Max in First Benchmark Result</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-ultra-chip-isnt-much-faster-than-m4-max-in-first-benchmark-result.2452256/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab0795f73e25b5d90403543884b4cad5c40915bd841faa22a4fcdb017136a38f","category":"Apple"}
