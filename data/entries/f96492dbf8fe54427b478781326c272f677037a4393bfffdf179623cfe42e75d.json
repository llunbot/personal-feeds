(If pressing 🌐 doesn’t bring up the viewer, check your settings. In macOS 12 Monterey or earlier, go to <em> &gt; System Preferences &gt; Keyboard</em> and enable the option in the Keyboard tab; in macOS 13 Ventura or later, go to  &gt; System Settings &gt; Keyboard and choose Show Emoji &amp; Symbols from the “Press 🌐 key to” menu.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Press Command-Control-Space.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In macOS 12 Monterey or earlier, go to <em> &gt; System Preferences &gt; Keyboard</em>, choose the Input Sources tab, and check “Show Input menu in menu bar”: Emoji &amp; Symbols is one choice.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In macOS 13 Ventura or later, go to <em> &gt; System Settings &gt; Keyboard</em>, click Edit next to Input Sources (under Text Input), and enable “Show Input menu in menu bar.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-emoji-viewer.png\" alt width=\"300\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-emoji-viewer.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 640w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-emoji-viewer.png?resize=249%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 249w\" height=\"770\" /><figcaption>You might first see the Emoji &amp; Symbols viewer.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When it first appears, the viewer might be in an abbreviated form that emphasizes emojis and shows links along the bottom. If so, click the palette icon in the upper-right corner to expand it into the larger Character Viewer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can search for characters via the field in the upper-right corner, and the viewer provides matches. Say you want to routinely insert 1/2, 1/4, and other fractions using the compact drawn fraction symbols in a font? Search for <code>fraction</code>, and all fractions appear. You can then select each one you want to have easy access to and click Add to Favorites below its preview on the right-hand side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After adding the first favorite, a Favorites link appears in the left-hand navigation list. You can then click Favorites to access characters and symbols you’ve added to the list.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-character-viewer-fractions-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-character-viewer-fractions-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1492w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-character-viewer-fractions-bordered.png?resize=300%2C224&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-character-viewer-fractions-bordered.png?resize=768%2C573&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mac911-character-viewer-fractions-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C896&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"896\" /><figcaption>Add drawn fractions with aplomb by searching for them in the Character Viewer and adding them to your favorites list.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Ellen.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also see: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672823/how-to-use-emoji-on-mac.html\">How to use Emoji on a Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671016/how-type-at-euro-hash-special-characters-mac.html\">How to type Æ, €, #, @, © and more special characters on a Mac.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
