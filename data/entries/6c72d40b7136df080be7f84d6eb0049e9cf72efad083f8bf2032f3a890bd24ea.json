Everything that Apple highlighted in June 2024 won't be available until well into 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has delayed some software features in the past, introducing them in later updates, but with Apple Intelligence, Apple announced everything well in advance and made it clear that the software updates would roll out over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman suggests that Apple could continue on this path, adopting a strategy that will see it release products when they're ready rather than pushing to get devices out on a scheduled timeline. As Apple's product lineup has grown more complex, software has also become more complicated. This year, Apple had to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/apple-pulls-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro/\">pull iPadOS 18</a> for the new M4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models after it was released, plus it had to remove beta versions of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-pulls-third-software-update-in-past-month/\">watchOS 11.1</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/apple-pulls-homepod-18-1-beta-2/\">HomePod Software 18.1</a> because the software was causing significant issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is not expected to stop offering yearly releases of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, but there are signs that it is holding updates on some other products. There was no new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a> this year (and it seems to be on a 3-year update cycle as of now), nor did Apple introduce a new Apple Watch Ultra, instead adding a new color for the Ultra 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMacs and iPads that are planned for 2025 will come at various points throughout the year and may not be tied to specific events like WWDC and the September ‌iPhone‌ event. Gurman has previously said Apple will introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-macbook-air/\">new MacBook Air models</a>, new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-4/\">new iPhone SE</a> early in 2025, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-studio-m4-mac-pro-2025/\">to follow in mid-2025</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a> to come later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman suggests that continuing on with a staggered approach could result in more innovation thanks to fewer timing constraints, and that such a strategy would also make Apple less predictable, which is something that the company aims for.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/apple-release-schedule-changes/\">Apple's Shift Toward More Staggered Releases Could Bring More Innovation and Less Predictability</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-shift-toward-more-staggered-releases-could-bring-more-innovation-and-less-predictability.2439574/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6c72d40b7136df080be7f84d6eb0049e9cf72efad083f8bf2032f3a890bd24ea","category":"Apple"}
