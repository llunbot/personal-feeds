The need to frequently access options and to fine-tune settings in creative pro software means these input devices aren’t ideal. What works are knob controllers and keypads that allow for precise control and quick access, like Logitech’s MX Creative Console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MX Creative Console consists of two parts plus configuration software. The most striking part is the dialpad with a large rotary knob, four buttons, and a roller. Depending on the application, the dial can be used to set volume or adjust exposure. The roller can be used to scroll through documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a quick start, the setup wizard already configures the buttons for some programs and the Finder. These settings can be adopted, customized, or extended later. A large number of commands for each individual program are available in a library, and profiles can be downloaded later from the Marketplace. There is already a large selection to start with, which should increase over time. For example, there are profiles with commands for Ableton Live, Adobe Photoshop, Capture One, Twitch, and Zoom Meeting. Predefined key commands for important creative apps, free programming of the keys, the creation of new programs, and the direct transfer of text passages to ChatGPT are just some of the practical functions. For beginners, however, I would like to see more ready-made profiles that make it easier to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rotary control like this is only useful if it runs smoothly– that’s exactly what the dial on the dialpad does. The lack of overtravel is a little unusual. Both dials, the large round one and the small roller, stop immediately when released. This is unusual when scrolling, but is an advantage when selecting and controlling. The fact that the dialpad has no cable also has a positive effect, allowing it to be used more flexibly when editing, for example.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Logitech MXCreativeConsole 02\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_02.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_02.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_02.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_02.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_02.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Thomas Bergbold </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The action ring is a very special function. It is called up by pressing a button and organizes eight commands around the mouse pointer position. By default, it is easily accessible for each program on the button to the right below the rotary knob. For example, eight commands from image optimization are displayed. If you move the cursor over the “Brightness” command, the brightness value can be adjusted directly using the rotary knob. This is a practical function for quick editing, especially in image processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A real highlight that sets the MX Creative Console apart from its competitors is the Action Ring. This now works in most programs and is particularly helpful when optimizing images in Adobe Lightroom and Capture One. Unfortunately, there are still a few bugs in Capture One: instead of changing the values, it can happen that turning the wheel jumps to the next image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the MX Creative Console is the keypad with nine illuminated buttons and two buttons for changing pages. Up to 15 pages can be created in the configuration software. The buttons are complemented by large graphics that show either the command such as play/pause or the program icon. There is a stand for the keypad, which improves the legibility of the keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When using the keypad, you first have to struggle with the stubborn cable. That is, until you insert the stand mount. The cable guide allows the keypad to be positioned better and the keys are also easier to read. The large, rubberized base provides reliable protection against slipping.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_08.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Logitech MXCreativeConsole 08\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_08.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_08.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_08.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_08.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_08.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Logitech_MXCreativeConsole_08.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Thomas Bergbold </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The MX Creative Console is available in light grey and graphite. A small contribution to environmental protection is the use of low-carbon aluminum, recycled plastic, and environmentally friendly paper packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Logitech MX Creative Console?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, Logitech has created an excellent tool that can be recommended to digital creatives. It is more affordable than other control knobs and keypads, which makes it appealing to aspiring image and video editors.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dfd6dad1c1c778021923fcfbb632d90673ec6188ade4dccd7db97b6ab0fc9de3","category":"Apple"}
