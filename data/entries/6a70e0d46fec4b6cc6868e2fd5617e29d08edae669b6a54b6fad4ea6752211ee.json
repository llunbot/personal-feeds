{"title":"Report: iPhone SE could shed its 10-year-old design “as early as next week”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/report-iphone-se-could-shed-its-10-year-old-design-as-early-as-next-week/","date":1738934339000,"content":"<p>The rumor mill's most reliable sources have been pointing to a refresh for Apple's low-end $429 iPhone SE to land early this year, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/apple-s-long-awaited-overhaul-of-budget-iphone-nears-release\">reports</a> that the launch could be coming \"as early as next week.\"</p>\n<p>The new fourth-generation iPhone SE ought to be the device's first significant makeover since 2020. It's said to be adopting a design similar to the iPhone 14—one of the iPhones with Face ID in a display notch, rather than inside the Dynamic Island—but with the internationally mandated USB-C port that was first added to the iPhone 15.</p>\n<p>We don't know much about its internal specs, but like older iPhone SE models, it will likely stick to a single-lens rear camera. Some reporting suggests the phone's 6.1-inch display model could shift to OLED to match the rest of the iPhone lineup, dropping the LCD panel technology from older models. It should also support Apple Intelligence, which would most likely mean either an A17 Pro chip (like the iPad mini 6 just got) or an A18 like in the iPhone 16. Both of these include 8GB of RAM, a consistent requirement for Apple Intelligence across the entire iPhone, iPad, and Mac lineup.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/report-iphone-se-could-shed-its-10-year-old-design-as-early-as-next-week/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/report-iphone-se-could-shed-its-10-year-old-design-as-early-as-next-week/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a70e0d46fec4b6cc6868e2fd5617e29d08edae669b6a54b6fad4ea6752211ee","category":"Tech"}
