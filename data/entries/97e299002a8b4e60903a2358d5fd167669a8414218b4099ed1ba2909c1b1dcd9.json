The announcement touted Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick as major advancements, with Meta claiming top performance in their categories and an enormous 10 million token context window for Scout. But so far the open-weights models have received an initial mixed-to-negative reception from the AI community, highlighting a familiar tension between AI marketing and user experience.</p>\n<p>\"The vibes around llama 4 so far are decidedly <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mid\">mid</a>,\" said independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a short interview with Ars Technica. Willison often <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/5/llama-4-notes/\">checks the community pulse</a> around open source and open weights AI releases in particular.</p>\n<p>While Meta positions Llama 4 in competition with closed-model giants like OpenAI and Google, the company continues to use the term \"open source\" despite <a href=\"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama4/LICENSE\">licensing restrictions</a> that prevent truly open use. As we have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/the-first-gpt-4-class-ai-model-anyone-can-download-has-arrived-llama-405b/\">noted in the past</a> with previous Llama releases, \"open weights\" more accurately describes Meta's approach. Those who sign in and accept the license terms can download the two smaller Llama 4 models from <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/meta-llama\">Hugging Face</a> or <a href=\"http://www.llama.com\">llama.com</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/metas-surprise-llama-4-drop-exposes-the-gap-between-ai-ambition-and-reality/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/metas-surprise-llama-4-drop-exposes-the-gap-between-ai-ambition-and-reality/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"97e299002a8b4e60903a2358d5fd167669a8414218b4099ed1ba2909c1b1dcd9","category":"Tech"}
