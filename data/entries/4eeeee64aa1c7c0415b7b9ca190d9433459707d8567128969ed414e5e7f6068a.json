To prove it, they’ve even built their own custom wind tunnel to test fabrics, and they went through 50 different fabric types in 135 different configurations to arrive at these socks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2.jpg\" alt=\"swiss side aero cycling socks shown on a rider from the front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The material is non-compressive, and the foot section is extremely lightweight and thin to maximize breathability and keep you cool. They’re white, and white only, because sublimation or dyes would have made the material less breathable…and added drag. (So, yes, it’s true – white socks are faster.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1268\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"swiss side aero cycling socks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-297x147.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-800x396.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-120x59.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-768x380.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-1536x761.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Swiss-Side-Aero-Cycling-Socks-1-2048x1014.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being shorter, the Swiss Side AERO Socks delivered between 60% – 80% of the drag reduction of the AERO CALF Sleeves, with drag savings between 3W – 6.5W measured at 45km/h (about 28mph).
