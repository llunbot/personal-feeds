While the release of smaller toxin molecules is well understood, methods of releasing larger toxin molecules have mostly eluded us until now. Researcher Stefan Raunser, director of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, and his team finally found out how the insect pathogen <i>Yersinia entomophaga </i>(which attacks beetles) releases its large-molecule toxin.</p>\n<p>They found that designated “soldier cells” sacrifice themselves and explode to deploy the poison inside their victim. “YenTc appears to be the first example of an anti-eukaryotic toxin using this newly established type of secretion system,” the researchers said in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01571-z\">study</a> recently published in Nature.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015365#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015365&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a8f290b7ba6e4ab6caea49f36e760e5ac63b4bbeae5c35f108ae393c0eefe621","category":"Tech"}
