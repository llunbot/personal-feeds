And the lack of evolution has left voice assistants surrounded by uncertainty. Google, for example, has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/google-is-killing-third-party-google-assistant-smart-displays/\">shut down third-party Google Assistant smart displays</a> and reportedly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-assistant-might-be-doomed-division-reorganizes-to-focus-on-bard/\">shifted Assistant manpower to Bard.</a> But while Google Assistant and Google's experimental Bard chatbot currently feel like different products with different uses, Amazon has dreams of uniting its generative AI efforts with its struggling Alexa business.</p>\n<p>It's no secret that belts are tightening at Amazon, compounding interest in making Alexa a strong revenue source. Alexa was reportedly set to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/\">lose $10 billion</a> in 2022, per an Insider report, and had failed to sufficiently engage users in ways that make Amazon money. Amazon is also enduring its largest round of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/amazon-is-firing-another-9000-workers/\">layoffs</a> and last week announced it is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/amazon-will-brick-all-halo-health-trackers-on-august-1/\">discontinuing Halo</a> fitness and sleep trackers.</p>\n<h2>Can generative AI generate Alexa revenue?</h2>\n<p>Amazon reportedly tried <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/report-halos-final-survival-attempts-made-even-amazons-workers-concerned/\">incorporating more AI into Halo</a> before killing itâ€”like having trackers leverage a smartphone camera and computer vision to analyze and share data with Amazon of user workouts. We weren't eager to trust Amazon with such AI usage; however, Amazon is reportedly shifting some of that invasive AI energy to Alexa.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936871#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936871&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a49c0caefc1e336d14aa6b66173c963fd807d88cbd7b86cb2487144e497bb690","category":"Tech"}
