A prequel film trilogy is now in development, in addition to the Amazon TV series. (credit: Tor Books)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Expectations are high among fans for Amazon Studio's forthcoming adaptation of <em>The Wheel of Time,</em> the late Robert Jordan's bestselling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time\">14-book series</a> of epic fantasy novels, purportedly due to premiere later this year. And now it looks like we'll be getting a <em>Wheel of Time</em> film trilogy as well, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/07/wheel-of-time-film-adaptation-in-the-works-with-thor-scribe-zack-stentz-1234791590/\">according to Deadline Hollywood</a>, focusing on the history of Jordan's fictional world before the events of the books.</p>\n<p>Most of the canonical pre-history of Jordan's fictional world is revealed in flashbacks and legends found in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765314622/?tag=arstech20-20\"><em>The Wheel of Time Companion</em></a>, but it is otherwise largely unexplored territory. The intent is to complement rather than compete with the storyline in Amazon's adaptation for TV. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/07/wheel-of-time-film-adaptation-in-the-works-with-thor-scribe-zack-stentz-1234791590/\">Per Deadline</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first movie will be set several millennia before the time of the books, in a period known as the “Age of Legends”— a futuristic utopia powered by a magical force shared by men and women known as the “One Power.” When an unspeakable evil is unleashed upon the world, civilization descends into chaos, and war blankets the globe. When men using the One Power become insane and destroy much of the planet, a small band of women unite under the White Tower, and are humanity’s last hope of survival.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Screenwriter Zack Stentz (<em>Thor</em>,<em> X-Men: First Class</em>, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World_Camp_Cretaceous\">Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous</a></em>) will take on screenwriting duties for the first film. “I’ve been a fan of Robert Jordan’s work for many years, and it is especially his allusions to the origins and backstory of <em>The Wheel of Time</em> that I have always found most intriguing. I’m excited to be bringing this era Robert Jordan conceptualized to life,” <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/07/wheel-of-time-film-adaptation-in-the-works-with-thor-scribe-zack-stentz-1234791590/\">Stentz said in a statement</a>. “A fusion of the fantasy and science-fiction genres, the <em>Age of Legends</em> is a tale of paradise lost, as a futuristic Garden of Eden devolves into a dangerous and broken world.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780002#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780002&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e17888845e9e821bc09d48fe063ab104ee6c0245ae4b1dc0c7dbe6c1e635cee4","category":"Tech"}
