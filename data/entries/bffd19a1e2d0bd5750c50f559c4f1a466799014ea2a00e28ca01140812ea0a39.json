{"title":"[Sponsor] Tara AI — Build Better Software, Faster","link":"https://tara.ai/?ref=daringfireball","date":1627998753000,"content":"\n<p>We all want to build great software — as quickly as possible. Here are three blockers we often hear from developers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Getting everyone aligned</em></p>\n\n<p>Get ideas across clearly with a clear problem statement and requirements. Use a tool like Tara to get sign-off before you start.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Visibility into actual progress</em></p>\n\n<p>Code changes are the best indicators of progress. Use tools that enable transparency. With Tara, everyone can see commits, blocks, and merges for a sense of true progress.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Manual status updates</em></p>\n\n<p>Manual updates are the achilles heel of every project. Use tools that automate tedious, low-value actions — like Tara’s auto-status that marks tasks as done when a PR merges.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One workspace for your team’s docs, sprints, and tasks synced to code. Plus an API for custom workflows.
