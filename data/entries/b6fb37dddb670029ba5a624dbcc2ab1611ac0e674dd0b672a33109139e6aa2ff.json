Every color of the rainbow is available, as are various shades of black, silver, and gold.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEach AirPod can be painted a different color, and the case can be customized in a different shade as well. Custom paint jobs for the AirPods are priced at $319, but the price goes up to $369 when adding in the case too. AirPods are priced at $179 direct from Apple, so getting a custom color is at least $140 more expensive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStill, even at that price point, ColorWare is the only way to get AirPods that are not white because Apple still does not offer AirPods in black or other colors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/colorware-airpods-options.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith ColorWare's painting, all of the ‌AirPods 3‌ features remain intact such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> connectivity for the case, spatial audio, adaptive EQ, and more, and the paint does not impact the functionality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCustom ‌AirPods 3‌ can be <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-1248-airpods-3rd-gen.aspx\">ordered from ColorWare</a> starting today, and they will ship out in about two to three weeks.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/colorware/\">ColorWare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/02/colorware-airpods-3/\">ColorWare Now Offering Custom-Painted AirPods 3 Starting at $319</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/colorware-now-offering-custom-painted-airpods-3-starting-at-319.2321466/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=N8iWRBFFZ0M:hdmNZIVZ1JI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=N8iWRBFFZ0M:hdmNZIVZ1JI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/N8iWRBFFZ0M\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b6fb37dddb670029ba5a624dbcc2ab1611ac0e674dd0b672a33109139e6aa2ff","category":"Apple"}
