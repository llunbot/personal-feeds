Among the new features arriving on Macs with Sonoma (aka macOS 14) are changes to widgets, a new Game Mode, the ability to easily turn web pages into web apps, and fun additions to video conferencing apps. Read on for the lowdown on all the new features and further improvements coming later in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update October 17: Apple has released the final beta version of macOS Sonoma 14.1</em> so the full update is likely to arrive in the week of October 23. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 Sonoma: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final version of macOS 14 was released to the general public on Tuesday, September 26. If you haven’t seen it yet it may just be necessary to go to System Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update to force your Mac to search for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>September 26 was the earliest macOS release date since 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 Sonoma: Latest version </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial release of Sonoma was on September 26, 2023. That was version <strong>macOS 14.0.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of updates over the coming months, both minor point releases for bug fixes and security updates and major releases that add some of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2073611/macos-14-sonoma-is-here-but-these-features-are-coming-later.html\">Sonoma features that weren’t available at launch.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 Sonoma beta: Latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current beta version is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2084160/macos-sonoma-14-1-beta-is-available-with-a-fix-for-remote-widgets.html\">macOS 14.1</a> which was released to developers on September 27. A second update to that beta arrived on October 4. The final Release Candidate arrived on October 17. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14.1 Sonoma release date and new features </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The macOS 14.1 beta update includes a new Coverage section in the General System Settings that includes Apple Care information. It also provides a fix for an issue with Remote Widgets and addresses issues with Wallet and WidgetKit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We anticipate that this update will arrive around 24 October, which means it will have taken fewer weeks than the initial .1 update for macOS Ventura (Ventura arrived on October 24 and macOS 13.1 arrived seven weeks later, on December 13).  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install macOS 14 Sonoma </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">how to install macOS Sonoma</a> in a separate article, we also cover some of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671831/macos-wont-install-fixes.html\">issues you might encounter installing Sonoma</a>, so if you do have any difficulties check out that article. It should be simple enough to install macOS Sonoma though. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to System Settings (System Preferences in older versions of macOS). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>General</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>Software Update</em> and your Mac will search for the update. If it’s the day that Sonoma arrives, you may have to wait a while before it shows up. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>Upgrade Now</em> and wait for the macOS installer to download. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once the installer has downloaded click on Install and wait while the software is installed on your Mac (during which time you won’t be able to use the Mac.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 Sonoma beta: Latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though macOS Sonoma has arrived, Apple is continuing to test a developer version and a public version of the beta. This is how Apple will test new features that will come later in 2023 and throughout 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 Sonoma: How to install and remove the beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a beta tester you may want to stop receiving beta updates once the full version of Sonoma arrives. In which case you can go to Software Updates, click on the (i) beside Beta updates and turn them off–that way you shouldn’t receive any more beta versions of the software and will be able to update to the full version of macOS 14. This process is a little more complicated if you want to downgrade from the iOS 17 beta to iOS 16, or from a subsequent beta of iOS 17 to the original version. If you then want to uninstall the beta, we have a guide for that: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove macOS Sonoma beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t been part of the beta but want to join, installing the beta is simple, especially since Apple changed the beta process in macOS 13.4. It used to be necessary to download the Beta Access Utility for every device, but now you only need to register your Apple ID for the beta program to install betas on every Apple device that is signed into that account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then when you go to Software Update, you’ll see a new tab for <em>Beta Updates</em>, which will list the beta versions that are available to you. If you want to install the public beta, select <em>macOS 14 Public Beta</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: betas are not as stable as the official version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install the beta, follow our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">macOS beta installation guide</a>.

Some new features may also require Apple chips and not run on Intel-based Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out which version of macOS older Macs can run take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS compatibility list</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 Sonoma features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the new features arriving with macOS 14.

Apple has redesigned the login screen so that you enter your password at the bottom rather than the middle of the screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explain how to navigate the new Lock Screen and set your preferences here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1981602/macos-sonoma-lock-screen-settigns-clock-user-accounts.html\">How to customize and navigate the new login screen.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Desktop widgets </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be able to add more Widgets from the Widget Gallery and place them anywhere on the screen. Apple has gone to lengths to make sure they aren’t distracting, they will essentially fade into the background.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will also be able to add Widgets from an iPhone using Continuity, the iPhone just needs to be nearby, on or same Wi-Fi network.

See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2048287/macos-sonoma-cityscape-underwater-earth-animated-wallpapers.html\">The best wallpapers included in macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Personal Voice </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Personal Voice feature will allow you to train your Mac to talk with your voice and then use that to convert text to speech. We explain how to use it here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2050750/how-to-make-your-mac-talk-like-you-macos-sonoma.html\">macOS Sonoma: How to train your Mac to talk in your voice</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Game Mode </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This new mode will ensure the game gets the highest priority on GPU and CPU, which should help with playability. It will, Apple says, make gaming on Mac “more immersive.” There are also changes that should reduce latency with controllers and improve in-game responsiveness. These sound like improvements that could help improve gaming on the Mac, but it may just be too little too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced that there are more Mac games coming, and demonstrated “Death Stranding: Directors Cut” (which is unfortunately not a new game). Apple also explained how it will help game developers bring their games to the Mac with a new Game Porting kit that includes tools that devs can use to quickly port their games to the Mac, significantly reducing the game development time. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1945978/game-porting-toolkit-gaming-mac-valve-proton.html\">Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit is the first real step to fixing Mac gaming.</a> We also explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1993906/how-to-game-mode-macos-14-sonoma.html\">How to use Game Mode to boost performance.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Video conferencing</h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"macOS Sonoma Meeting presentation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macOS-sonoma-FaceTime-Meeting.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption>You will appear in front of your presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple described how when you share your screen during a presentation your presence can get lost. To fix this issue Apple has devised a new video effect called Presenter Overlay which will overlay your face over the presentation, separating you from the background. This can appear like the picture above, or be a smaller bubble with your face in (which may cover less of the presentation).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other new features include the ability to add a reaction to your video to show how you feel about something. For example, if you show two thumbs up a fireworks animation will play. These features can also be used as video effects with other video conferencing apps, so it’s not tied to FaceTime. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More updates are coming to WebKit, including new typography. Private browsing will get a new feature that will block private browsing windows when you aren’t using them. It will be possible to share Passkeys and Passwords with family members, This will be end-to-end encrypted via iCloud Keychain. You will be able to create Safari Profiles so you can separate accounts between work and home/school profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2012427/safari-17-features-web-apps-profiles-private-favorites-widget-extensions.html\">Safari 17: All the new features coming to your Mac this fall</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Web apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be easy to make a website you use a lot into a Web App. Just open the webpage and choose File &gt; Add to Dock to add a webpage to the Dock as an icon and open it to get an app-like appearance for that web page that opens outside of Safari.  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1984619/macos-sonoma-how-to-web-apps.html\">Learn how to make and manage Web Apps in macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PDFs and Notes </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AutoFill will make it easy to fill out PDFs faster and securely.
