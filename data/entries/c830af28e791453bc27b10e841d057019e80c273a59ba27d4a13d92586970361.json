If they successfully do so, they get a second marshmallow; if not, they don't. The test has become a useful paradigm for scientists interested in studying the various factors that might influence one's ability to delay gratification, thereby promoting social cooperation. According to <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.250392\">a paper</a> published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, one factor is trust: If children are paired in a marshmallow test and one promises not to eat their treat for the specified time, the other is much more likely to also refrain from eating it.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/r-i-p-walter-mischel-father-of-the-infamous-marshmallow-test/\">previously reported</a>, psychologist Walter Mischel's <a href=\"https://bingschool.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/115-dev_psych_1990.pdf\">landmark behavioral study</a> involved 600 kids between the ages of four and six, all culled from Stanford University's Bing Nursery School. He would give each child a marshmallow and give them the option of eating it immediately if they chose. But if they could wait 15 minutes, they would get a second marshmallow as a reward. Then Mischel would leave the room, and a hidden video camera would tape what happened next.</p>\n<p>Some kids just ate the marshmallow right away. Others found a handy distraction: covering their eyes, kicking the desk, or poking at the marshmallow with their fingers. Some smelled it, licked it, or took tiny nibbles around the edges. Roughly one-third of the kids held out long enough to earn a second marshmallow. Several years later, Mischel noticed a strong correlation between the success of some of those kids later in life (better grades, higher self-confidence) and their ability to delay gratification in nursery school. Mischel's follow-up study confirmed the correlation.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-peers-promise-can-help-kids-pass-the-marshmallow-test/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-peers-promise-can-help-kids-pass-the-marshmallow-test/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c830af28e791453bc27b10e841d057019e80c273a59ba27d4a13d92586970361","category":"Tech"}
