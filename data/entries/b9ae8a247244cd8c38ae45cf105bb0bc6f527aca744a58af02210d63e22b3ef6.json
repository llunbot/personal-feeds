The first series of Apple silicon Macs powered by M1 chips already deliver industry-leading performance per watt while running impressively quiet and cool.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first Apple devices with 3nm chips will likely debut in 2023, including iPhone 15 models with an A17 chip and Apple silicon Macs with M3 chips â€” all names are tentative. <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma last month reported that some of the M3 chips will have up to four dies, which the report said could translate into those chips <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/05/apple-silicon-macs-3nm-chip-roadmap/\">having up to a 40-core CPU</a>, compared to the 8-core M1 chip and 10-core M1 Pro and M1 Max chips.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the meantime, Macs with M2 chips and iPhone 14 models are expected to use chips based on TSMC's N4 process, which is another iteration of its 5nm process.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/02/tsmc-reportedly-testing-3nm-chip-production/\">Macs With 'M3' Chips Expected to Use TSMC's 3nm Chip Technology With Test Production Reportedly Underway</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macs-with-m3-chips-expected-to-use-tsmcs-3nm-chip-technology-with-test-production-reportedly-underway.2325912/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ydnLsEcXTdM:LAkpDNIeX7k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ydnLsEcXTdM:LAkpDNIeX7k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b9ae8a247244cd8c38ae45cf105bb0bc6f527aca744a58af02210d63e22b3ef6","category":"Apple"}
