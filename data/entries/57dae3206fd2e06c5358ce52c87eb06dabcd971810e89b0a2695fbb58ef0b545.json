An all-in-one app facilitates wireless data access for streaming media, and also includes photo recognition for searching pictures by text, along with high-strength encryption.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe NASync series come in 2-bay and 4-bay models for home use, and 6-bay and 8-bay models for business, offering up to 184TB of storage capacity and up to 32GB of DDR5 memory. Drive installation is also made easier thanks to what Ugreen calls a unique manual push-pull mechanism, so no additional tools are required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the SATA drive bays, all the NASync devices in the range include at least two M.2 SSD drive slots for installing solid-state drives, which can be used for extra storage or as a fast caching space for speeding up read/write performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEach NAS is equipped with dual Thunderbolt 4 Ports, an SD slot, USB-A ports and Type-C ports, NASync can be connected to various storage devices such as SD cards, mobile hard disks, USB flash drives, and disk array cabinets for data back-up and synchronization. In addition, the NASync Series is also equipped with a PCIe 4.0 X4 expansion slot and dual 10GB Ethernet ports that can be aggregated into a 20GB bandwidth, offering up to 2,500MB/s download speeds. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ugreen-nasync.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nUgreen is also launching an \"all-flash\" compact model for creative and media professionals that features four M.2 SSD drive slots and a built-in Wi-Fi chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInterested users can follow the campaign for the Intel-powered NASync Series on <a href=\"https://nas.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-nas-storage-preheat\">Kickstarter.com</a>, which launches in mid-March, according to Ugreen.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ugreen/\">Ugreen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">CES 2024</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ugreen-intel-nasync-nas-series/\">CES 2024: Ugreen Unveils NASync Network Attached Storage Series</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-ugreen-unveils-nasync-network-attached-storage-series.2415969/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57dae3206fd2e06c5358ce52c87eb06dabcd971810e89b0a2695fbb58ef0b545","category":"Apple"}
