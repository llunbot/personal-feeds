Since then, we’ve learned a lot about how to make cargo bikes even better, and we applied those insights to the Quick Haul Long. The bike retains the GSD’s core features but it comes at a more accessible price, without compromising safety or</em> <em>reliability.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child.jpeg\" alt=\"Tern Bicycless Quick Haul Long removing child\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-removing-child-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a lot of the bicycles that Tern has to offer, the Quick Haul Long has 20″ wheels. But even with its compact nature, it maintains the same overall length as a standard city bike with the added benefit of being much more capable. Rated for a gross vehicle weight of 419 lbs, the Quick Haul Long can easily support two children or an adult on the back. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market.jpeg\" alt=\"Tern Bicycless Quick Haul Long farmers market\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-farmers-market-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing a smooth and stable ride, the Quick Haul Long has a low center of gravity and, a stiff frame that is optimized for rider comfort, even when under load. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quick Haul Long Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-virticel-storage-e1719351371264.jpeg\"><img width=\"851\" height=\"1015\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-virticel-storage-e1719351371264.jpeg\" alt=\"Tern Bicycless Quick Haul Long virticel storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-virticel-storage-e1719351371264.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-virticel-storage-e1719351371264-252x300.jpeg 252w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-virticel-storage-e1719351371264-101x120.jpeg 101w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tern-Bicycless-Quick-Haul-Long-virticel-storage-e1719351371264-768x916.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vertical parking: </strong>Like many other Tern models, the Quick Haul Long can be stored on its back rack.
