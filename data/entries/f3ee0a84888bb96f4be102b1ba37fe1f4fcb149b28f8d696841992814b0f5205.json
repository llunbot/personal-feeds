So, Sour created The Business – a fork developed to pass the toughest tests in the industry so you can ride wherever and as far as adventure takes you. Apparently, Sour’s The Business is also the first fork to pass independent test lab EFBE’s grueling Tri-Test – a 3-part test going far beyond basic test standards to better address the way cyclists push the limits with modern bikes off-the-beaten-track…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sour Business ultra-tough carbon gravel bikepacking fork</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Business ultra-tough carbon gravel adventure bikepacking fork, custom Purple Haze photo by Flori, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_Sour-Purple-Haze-custom-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

But Sour sweated the details even more, to bring adventure riders another level of strength and durability, so it can go anywhere you dream to roam.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Business ultra-tough carbon gravel adventure bikepacking fork, custom Purple Haze photo by Flori, front view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_front-view-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it called the Business fork? Well, last year Sour made a heavy-duty BMX-style steel bikepacking fork for their Pasta Party off-road adventure 29er – dubbed <a href=\"https://sour.bike/en/the-new-party-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">the Party fork</a>. This new carbon model is still adventure-ready, but a lot lighter and likely to be ridden quite a bit faster… all business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why the EFBE Tri-Test?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Business ultra-tough carbon gravel adventure bikepacking fork, EFBE Tri-Test\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_EFBE-Tri-Test-of-Intend-MTB-fork-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

Their benchmark Tri-Test doesn’t stop at conventional limited bicycle testing standards, but subjects a component to tougher fatigue tests, maximum load tests, AND overload tests – all designed to push a new component to the extreme and see how it really would hold up to a lifetime of actual riding and abuse. The Tri-Test has truly become the new benchmark for design engineers looking to create the toughest bikes and components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbon Sour Business fork was tri-tested to cyclocross &amp; gravel’s condition 2 back in February – passing EFBE’s bending fatigue test, brake mount fatigue test, static bending test, static brake test, and maximum load/ overload test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to learn more about what EFBE does?

That means that each cargo cage could carry up to 7.5kg per side, or a low-rider rack connected at 3-points can haul up to 15kg. The fork also gets fender mounts down at the bottom too, and a replaceable threaded insert for the 12mm thru-axle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Business ultra-tough carbon gravel adventure bikepacking fork, custom Purple Haze photo by Flori, PM160 flat mount 160mm disc brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_photo-by-Flori_post-mount-160-disc-brake-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork gets FM160 direct flat mount disc brake mounting for increased strength, and fewer parts that can fail. That does mean that it mounts a standard (typically 140mm) caliper through the fork leg without an adapter, much like a rear flat mount brake. But it does mean that you can’t run smaller than a 160mm rotor, and for example, if you use Campagnolo brakes, you need to use the 140mm caliper, <em>not</em> the 160mm direct mount front caliper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork has a 403mm axle-to-crown length, and 45mm offset. Sour claims a weight of 550g – the fork with 300mm uncut steerer tested by EFBE weighed an actual 552.9g according to their testing report.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sour The Business fork – Pricing &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Business ultra-tough carbon gravel adventure bikepacking fork, rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sour-Business-ultra-tough-carbon-gravel-adventure-bikepacking-fork_rendering-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the new Business fork was meant to be the new standard carbon fork option for Sour’s 1050€ made-in-Germany Purple Haze gravel frame, adding just 250€ on top of the frame, and even including a headset.
