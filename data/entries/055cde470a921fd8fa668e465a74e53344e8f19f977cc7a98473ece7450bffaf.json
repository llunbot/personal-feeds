{"title":"Flanders dreams, race celebrations and coffee: Question time with Emma Norsgaard","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/question-time-emma-norsgaard","date":1715173794000,"content":"\n      <p><strong>Did you always want to be a professional bike racer?</strong></p>\n<p>No, actually. I’ve always been the type of person who takes things as they come, and when I was younger, I never pictured myself being a professional. I never had a female cyclist as a role model because you couldn’t see racing on the TV, and I didn’t have social media, so my role models were never female. I never thought it was possible.</p>\n<p><strong>What type of rider are you?</strong></p>\n<p>I like to see myself as a Classics rider. I am a little bit fast, too.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><strong>You’ve earned yourself the nickname ‘The Danish Rocket’. Do you like this name?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I take it as a compliment. I was super happy the first time I heard it. Movistar’s team owner named me that.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the proudest moment of your career so far?</strong></p>\n<p>For sure, the Tour de France. It is the proudest I have ever felt, not just for me, but for the whole team.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you celebrate the Tour de France stage win?</strong></p>\n<p>We were all on the bus together, having a glass of champagne and me and Liane Lippert, who had won a stage a few days before, said a few words. I also had some tiramisu. It was just so great. The only thing missing was my husband. Otherwise, it was perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Your husband Mikkel Bjerg (UAE Team Emirates) and brother Mathias Norsgaard (Movistar) are both pro racers – what’s the best thing about them being cyclists, too?</strong></p>\n<p>We get to enjoy so many things together: altitude camps and training. I think one of my favourite moments is when we are training together. I also get to see them grow as people and athletes – in a way that I wouldn’t if I was not a cyclist myself.</p>\n<p><strong>And the worst?</strong></p>\n<p>Everything is about cycling. Luckily, my brother has a girlfriend now who is not a cyclist, and this is actually really nice, just talking normally for once.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Emma-Norsgaard01_01_2023_1024x1024.jpg?v=1715173113\" /></div>\n<p><strong>You’re Danish Gravel National Champion – what do you like about gravel racing?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s different. When I did some gravel races last year, it didn’t feel like a race. I felt like I was going back to my childhood. It’s not so serious. It’s chilled. It brought back many memories, especially when I did nationals, because my parents were on the sideline, and my grandparents. It’s something I will do again.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your dream race to win?</strong></p>\n<p>The Classics have always been my dream. The Tour of Flanders, especially.</p>\n<p><strong>You also have another dream of owning your own café – what would be your house speciality?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh my, this has been my dream for so long. It’s always been a dream of my mum’s, so I think I got it from her. Every year, I have a calendar where I write down my goals, and it’s always on there. The speciality, for sure, will be coffee and a bakery with sourdough.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you name your café?</strong></p>\n<p>At first, I was thinking of something super original like ‘Café Emma’ because, in Denmark, it’s normal to call your café after your name. But then I thought maybe it was too much to name it after myself, so I don’t know, maybe something Spanish.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer coffee over tea?</strong></p>\n<p>Coffee, every day. I try to stick to two because otherwise, it will get out of hand. But I always make it with the AeroPress or V60, so I like to take care of my coffee. If I cannot get a good one, I prefer not to have any.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any hidden talents?</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, technology. I don’t know why, but I am sick at it, like it just comes to me.</p>\n<p><strong>What song would you pick to sing for karaoke?</strong></p>\n<p>Westlife’s When You’re Looking Like That. I did this with my friend Julie, and we were so good.</p>\n<p><strong>People say women’s cycling has improved greatly over the past few years, but what’s something you think still needs changing?</strong></p>\n<p>It has improved a lot with the coverage of races, but I think the key is to improve on this even more. Almost every men’s race is shown, and I think it would be nice if the women had the same and not only the last 20 kilometres.</p>\n<p><strong>And finally, finish the sentence, happiness is...</strong></p>\n<p>Happiness is rest days, back home in sunny Denmark, having a coffee with my family. Perfect.</p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"055cde470a921fd8fa668e465a74e53344e8f19f977cc7a98473ece7450bffaf","category":"Cycling"}
