The details allegedly originate from a \"mass production confirmed sample.\" The blog has previously offered accurate insights into Apple's component strategy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe claimed weight is similar to an iPhone SE 2 or iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively. As for the battery, the capacity figure is not unlike the iPhone 12, which has a 2,815mAh battery. However, the leaker's post does note that there remains a possibility that Apple will use a high-density battery in the iPhone 17 Air, which could increase its \"actual capacity\" by 15-20%. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in March that device will have a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/iphone-17-air-high-density-battery-rumor/\">high-density</a>\" battery. More recently, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/iphone-17-air-advanced-silicon-battery/\">report out of Asia</a> has suggested that the iPhone 17 Air could become the first Apple smartphone to adopt advanced battery technology, with Apple supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHaving said that, reports have been mixed regarding the iPhone 17 Air's potential battery performance. <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma claimed the device will have \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/\">worse</a>\" battery life compared to previous iPhone models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn internal testing, Apple apparently determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to the report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the iPhone 17 Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the other hand, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has offered a more optimistic outlook, stating that battery life would be \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/\">on par with current iPhones</a>\" thanks to hardware and software optimizations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 5.5mm-thin device is also rumored to incorporate Apple's power-efficient C1 modem and lack an Ultra Wide camera, which could potentially provide more internal space for a larger battery. We'll know for sure when the device replaces the \"Plus\" model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup, which is expected to launch around mid-September, per Apple's typical fall release schedule.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/\">Naver</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/iphone-17-air-battery-capacity-revealed/\">iPhone 17 Air Battery Capacity and Weight Allegedly Revealed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-battery-capacity-and-weight-allegedly-revealed.2457317/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f9dab0fc2841665b96adb9f47b789da770e26223862a6883382852cbec3391a6","category":"Apple"}
