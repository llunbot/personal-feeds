Kuo said Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chip will support \"the latest Wi-Fi 7 spec,\" but he did not provide any further details. The chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 7nm manufacturing process known as N7, he added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo has aligned with information shared last year by Jeff Pu, another analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro models would be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, and he said the chip would expand to the entire iPhone 18 lineup the following year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 7 allows for data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 can provide peak speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4Ã— increase over Wi-Fi 6E.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/kuo-iphone-17-apple-wi-fi-7-chip/\">Kuo: iPhone 17 to Feature Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip.2441581/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"755a1136cabb4ee9f827fea974161ed71f7e32ed6609324f4833138ff64cfc2d","category":"Apple"}
