Now, as the rocket nears its final launch, it's missing some critical components.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/the-case-of-the-missing-vega-avum-propellant-tanks/\">European Spaceflight newsletter reports</a> that two of the four propellant tanks on the fourth stage of the Vega rocket—the upper stage, which is powered by dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide fuel—went missing earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Now, it seems that the propellant tanks have been found. However, the newsletter says, the tanks were recovered in a dismal state, crushed, alongside metal scraps in a landfill. Someone, apparently, had trashed the tanks. This is a rather big problem for Avio, as this was to be the final Vega rocket launched, and the production lines are now closed for this hardware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988257#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988257&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc452a814acdfc3b30cdea9aacc25694a78cb6c741641f59b8a428da2eb3e969","category":"Tech"}
