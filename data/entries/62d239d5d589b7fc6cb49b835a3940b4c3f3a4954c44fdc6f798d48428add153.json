{"title":"StopTheMadness Pro","link":"https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/","date":1715792669000,"content":"\n<p>The previous item was a good reminder that I haven’t linked to StopTheMadness in a while. I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/05/16/stopthemadness\">first recommended it back in 2018</a>, and mentioned it again in 2022 after developer Jeff Johnson <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/03/substitute-web-fonts-with-stopthemadness\">added a font substitution feature at my request</a>. As I wrote then:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s such a little thing, and I know most people can’t detect the\ndifferences between Helvetica and Arial and don’t care, but it\nmakes me so happy every day never to see the cursed fonts Arial\nand Courier New.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>StopTheMadness Pro does so much more than that. I’ve been using it for so long now that I’m taken aback when I use a factory-fresh no-extension installation of Safari. StopTheMadness Pro is a canonical example of a great power user utility, and Johnson updates it with new features (and new workarounds for web development dark patterns) regularly.</p>\n\n<p>$15 one-time purchase, with support for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS — and (optional) iCloud sync for shared settings across all your devices. Highly recommended.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/15/stopthemadness-pro\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"62d239d5d589b7fc6cb49b835a3940b4c3f3a4954c44fdc6f798d48428add153","category":"Tech"}
