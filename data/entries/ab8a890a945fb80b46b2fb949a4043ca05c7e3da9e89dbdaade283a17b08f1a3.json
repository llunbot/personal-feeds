Wolff makes a wide range of Class 2 ebikes; the bulk of them are commuters but they also offer cargo bikes, fat bikes, and folding bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their lineup includes several off-road capable models, and ebikes with step-through frames for those who require (or just prefer) maximum accessibility. The company has been expanding quickly over the last few years, and having outgrown two previous facilities they’re relocating to a large new headquarters this spring. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vela-Plus-side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vela-Plus-side.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vela-Plus-side.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vela-Plus-side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vela-Plus-side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vela-Plus-side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vela-Plus-side-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolff E-Bikes fall in the mid-price range, with all models coming in between $1350 and $3299 USD. The brand is proud to offer name brand components including Shimano, SRAM, Bafang and Tektro, on bikes that are thoughtfully appointed with crucial accessories for bicycle commuting. All of Wolff’s 2023 models are Class 2 ebikes with pedal assist and throttle modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vega-front-end.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vega-front-end.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vega-front-end.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vega-front-end-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vega-front-end-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vega-front-end-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Vega-front-end-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolff offers a large lineup so we won’t run down every model in this post, but many of their ebikes include key commuter accessories and features like tool-free adjustable handlebars, suspension seatposts, disc brakes, color LED displays, integrated front and rear lights, cargo racks and fenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-hub-motor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-hub-motor.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-hub-motor.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-hub-motor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-hub-motor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-hub-motor-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-hub-motor-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike some companies you won’t see the same drive system on every one of Wolff’s ebikes; some models use hub motors, while others feature mid-drive systems from various brands (including Wolff themselves).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that’s always nice to hear is Wolff says they are committed to providing after-sales service and keeping replacement parts in stock for their customers. Now let’s check out a few different models…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lyra – $1350</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Lyra.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Lyra.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Lyra.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Lyra-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Lyra-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Lyra-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Lyra-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting from the bottom end of the range, the Lyra is Wolff’s least expensive e-commuter. The Lyra features a 6061 aluminum frame, and rolls on double-walled alloy rims wrapped with 700x38c tires. This model gets a Shimano 7 speed drivetrain and mechanical disc brakes for all-weather reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lyra is powered by Wolff’s own 350w hub drive motor, and its range is approx. 50km (with medium assistance). The handlebar control unit offers five assistance levels. As for accessories, the Lyra offers front and rear lights (controlled by the display unit), a set of fenders, a rear cargo rack, and a kickstand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lyra is only sold in two frame sizes; 48cm and 54cm. It is available in Matte Black or Silver Grey. Part of a product family, this bike is also available as the Lyra 42 (offering a 42cm sloped top tube frame) and the Lyra ST (step-through frame).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ursa Major – $2549</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Ursa-Major.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Ursa-Major.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Ursa-Major.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Ursa-Major-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Ursa-Major-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Ursa-Major-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Ursa-Major-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolff’s higher end commuter options include the Ursa Major, a hybrid style commuter with fatter tires. Between its relaxed geometry and 26×4” wheels, this model offers comfort and some off-road capability. The Ursa Major’s aluminum frame gets a fully integrated battery to power its Bafang 500w motor. Wolff’s display unit provides five power levels, and the bike’s range is roughly 54km at medium assistance. The Ursa Major gets a twist-grip throttle for when you get tired of pedalling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano provides a 7 speed drivetrain, and mechanical disc brakes ensure ample stopping power. The Ursa Major comes with a rear cargo rack, front and rear lights, and a kickstand, but no fenders for those beefy tires. This model is only available in one 50.5cm frame size, and one Matte Dark Navy color option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolff also offers the Ursa, (riding on 27.5×2.2” tires) Ursa ST (step-through frame) and Ursa Major ST (fat tires and step-through frame). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Colossus – $2699</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Colossus-on-snow.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Colossus-on-snow.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Colossus-on-snow.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Colossus-on-snow-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Colossus-on-snow-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Colossus-on-snow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Colossus-on-snow-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A fatbike MTB that can handle some off-road fun, the Colossus is one of Wolff’s newest models. The Colossus features an aluminum frame, a rigid fork, and rides on double-walled rims with 26×4.5” Kenda tires. This model gets a 9-speed drivetrain with a SRAM X5 11-34t cassette and a 42t chainring up front, plus jumps to hydraulic Tektro disc brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame-integrated battery powers a Bafang 48V 500w motor, and Wolff’s control unit offers five assistance levels. The Colossus’ range, with medium assistance, is about 56km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Color options are Bright Blue or Titan Grey, and surprisingly the Colossus is only offered in one frame size (47cm). If Wolff sees success with this model, I’d certainly hope to see more frame sizes coming down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tucana – $3299</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-tucana.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-tucana.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-tucana.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-tucana-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-tucana-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-tucana-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-tucana-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For riders hauling loads of stuff around town, Wolff offers the Tucana cargo trike. Its aluminum frame features a step-through design, and this bike gets a Mozo 80mm suspension fork for increased comfort and stability. Fatter tires also keep things stable and smooth, with a 24×4” wheel up front and two 20×4” tires out back. The trike comes equipped with a 7 speed Shimano drivetrain and disc brakes on all three wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tucana’s 48V 500w Bafang motor drives its front wheel, and is controlled by Wolff’s five-level handlebar display unit. At medium assistance the bike’s range is 57km. Key accessories include the aluminum front and rear baskets and fenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tucana is available in one 42cm frame size, and color options are Raspberry Quartz or Sapphire Blue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Utopia – $2799</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Utopia.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Utopia.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Utopia.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Utopia-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Utopia-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Utopia-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-Utopia-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you travel often or saving space is a priority, check out the Utopia folding ebike. This fat-tired folder is a versatile machine that offers a little off-road capability. Its frame and rigid fork are both made of aluminum, and its 20×4” Kenda tires ride on double-walled rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Utopia gets a Jiabo 48V 500W rear drive motor, controlled by Wolff’s handlebar unit providing five assistance levels. Range is estimated at 46km with medium assistance. A 9-speed SRAM drivetrain offers wide-range gearing, and Tektro mechanical disc brakes reel things in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A kickstand, a set of aluminum fenders and a rear rack are included, and the Utopia’s front and rear lights are controlled by Wolff’s display unit. If the Utopia seems overbuilt for your needs, Wolff also offers the Europa folding ebike with a more road-specific build.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-two-shot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-two-shot.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-two-shot.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-two-shot-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-two-shot-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-two-shot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wolff-e-bikes-two-shot-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolff E-Bikes are available through 130+ dealers across North America.
