COVID-19 vaccines will join the ranks of vaccine for measles, mumps, polio, hepatitis B, pertussis, tetanus, and chicken pox, which are already required for school attendance.</p>\n<p>The mandate isn't immediate. The requirement will not kick in until the vaccine is fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration for school aged children. As such, the requirement will be phased in by grade groups—grades 7 through 12 and K-6—and begin at the start of the school term following full FDA approval.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800178#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800178&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bebbbc9f334d0ab88cb2abdab0c6377a09cfc6b61cf50a41d4ffbab289563a27","category":"Tech"}
