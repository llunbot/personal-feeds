Building on the success of the previous version, the new Super Duty promises to be more rugged, capable, and versatile than before. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack.jpeg\" alt=\"1UPUSA New Super Duty Hitch Rack full rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-full-rack-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Super Duty brings significant updates to meet the expanding needs of cyclists. Designed to carry bikes up to 100 pounds per tray, the SD is engineered to be durable and reliable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Since the original Super Duty launched in 2016, it has been hailed as one of the best racks on the planet,</em>” said Kurt Barclay, Marketing Director for 1UP USA. “<em>We’ve listened to feedback, observed how cyclists are pushing the boundaries of bike transportation, and sought ways to enhance the already impressive capabilities of the SD rack. The result is what we consider the ultimate evolution of the 1UP USA Super Duty Rack.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Super Duty (SD) Retail and Key Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: “<em>The base price varies between $600 and $950 depending on tray configuration</em>” </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>More Capable</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With thicker side plates and pivot beams, tray capacity now allows up to 100 lbs for the first two trays. Spacing has been extended between bike trays to provide additional clearance between bike spots. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms.jpeg\" alt=\"1UPUSA New Super Duty Hitch Rack beefier guide arms\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-beefier-guide-arms-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Off-road Ready</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Super Duty is rated for extreme off-road use. But now it’s compatible with Wheel Chock. Wheel Chock is an accessory that cradles the front wheel eliminating that annoying “wheel flop” when the steer tube rotates while the bike is in the rack. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up.jpeg\" alt=\"1UPUSA New Super Duty Hitch Rack wheel chock close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-wheel-chock-close-up-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This also stabilizes the bike, making it more stout and better for serious off-road use. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Clean and Tidy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Super Duty also folds up to 90° when not in use, only protruding 8″ from the hitch. The single bike option allows for most rear hatches to open without lowering the rack. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>One-handed Operation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position.jpeg\" alt=\"1UPUSA New Super Duty Hitch Rack free ratchet position\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-free-ratchet-position-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Redesigned glide bars and levers offer a stronger connection to the arms that hold the tires. This enables a press-and-lift feature that allows users to disengage the ratchet and open/close the arms with one hand, making loading and unloading the bikes easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release.jpeg\" alt=\"1UPUSA New Super Duty Hitch Rack new quick release\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-new-quick-release-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Super Duty is compatible with the optional loading ramp, allowing uncomplicated mounting of heavy bikes onto the rack. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Adjustable Wheelbase</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width.jpeg\" alt=\"1UPUSA New Super Duty Hitch Rack adjustable tray width\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1UPUSA-New-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-adjustable-tray-width-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SD introduces adjustable-width trays, providing the option for four different width configurations: standard at 54″, long at 58″, and offset to either the driver or passenger side at 56″.
