But could you still make sleeping on top of your car while doing it look this good?</p><h2>Redtail Overland overview</h2><p>Nothing about the Redtail Overland overrides the glamping swag imprinted deeply in its DNA. Sure, the hard-sided build makes it easier to fold down than a soft-sided entry (no gathering up material), and it’s still legal in bear country, where tents are forbidden.</p><p>But its principal strength is clearly the superlative comfort and class it evokes. With its shiny black carbon fiber and isosceles shape, it looks like a cross between the Mercury space capsules and Darth Vader’s weird meditation chamber inside the Death Star.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x.jpg\" alt=\"redtail overland RTT\" width=\"1136\" height=\"639\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x.jpg 1136w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x.jpg 1136w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13153616/EL3_5546_e2334603-40b6-4418-8e5c-e349abb163e0_1400x-768x432.jpg 768w\"></p><p>It performs a bit like those things, too — if you like to meditate, you can do it in the Redtail Overland RTC under solar-powered LED lighting, perched on a three-inch mattress, comforted by four-season heating. At the enticingly named “Summit” top trim spec, you can even customize your upholstery. Hell, you don’t even have to go outside your car to get into it. If you have a sunroof (you…<em>do</em> have a sunroof, right?), you can crawl through it into the Redtail Overland RTC via the convenient hatch.</p><p>Redtail also lowers the threshold for installation, using a proprietary system that includes its own crossbars and feet, so you don’t have to get a roof rack. And the 270W/380W solar panel arrays (lower power level for the smaller RT90) deliver plenty of power.</p><h2>Options, pricing, and purchasing</h2><p>This is where it gets complicated. Buying the Redtail Overland RTC is akin to buying a car — as you’d think it might be, at its price. Redtail Overland offers two sizes and three trim levels for the taking.</p><p>Two sizes are available: the RT90, which is 20” shorter than the 110” long RT110. The RT90 with the base “Basecamp” trim costs a stout $19,500 to start. Considering the investment, it’s pretty spartan: you pretty much get a shell and add your own power and amenities. Add $2000 for the RT110 version.</p><p>Crank it up to the top-of-the-line Summit package, “for the adventure icon,” and get a much nicer home than most of the world lives in. All the electricity and heat you could want, the aforementioned choice in upholstery, and an extra battery just in case the late-night Mario Kart session runs long. In the RT90 size, the package costs a robust $29,000. The RT110 version? If you have to ask, you can’t afford it…but it’s a whopping $31,500.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent.jpg\" alt=\"redtail overland RTT\" width=\"959\" height=\"638\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent.jpg 959w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-800x532.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent.jpg 959w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-800x532.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13154026/1camptent-768x511.jpg 768w\"></p><p>None of that pricing includes the sunroof hatch — that’s an extra $1,500.
