We thought we'd take a closer look at Personas in ‌visionOS‌ 1.1, comparing the update to the prior ‌visionOS‌ 1.0.2 software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nPersonas are a key feature on the Vision Pro, representing the user in video calls on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, Zoom, and other platforms. Personas are a digital representation of the Vision Pro wearer, and are captured using the headset itself. With the Vision Pro, the wearer takes a 3D facial scan that captures their facial structure, expressions, hand movements, and more. Apple describes a Persona as an \"authentic spatial representation\" of a person.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released Personas in a beta capacity, and it's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-vision-pro-personas-deeply-weird/\">not hard to see why</a> with the Personas that have been shared on the initial versions of the ‌visionOS‌ software. Reviewers have called personas \"deeply weird,\" \"deep in the uncanny valley,\" \"ridiculous,\" and \"frightening.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith ‌visionOS‌ 1.1, Personas have more natural looking eyes, skin tone improvements, and more detail that adds realism, though Apple's scanning feature still struggles with hair.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost Personas are noticeably better with the 1.1 update, but Apple still needs to do a lot of work to eliminate the otherworldly, unnatural vibe that the virtual representations give off. ‌visionOS‌ 1.1 is available to developers in beta right now, and it will likely see a launch in March alongside iOS 17.4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also adds Contact Key Verification, support for resetting the headset without a computer, and support for mobile device management.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/testing-personas-visionos-1-1/\">Testing Improved Vision Pro Personas in visionOS 1.1</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-improved-vision-pro-personas-in-visionos-1-1.2418951/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9bac5555bc7080e85ed6027a7c027844e9ced85220c78c46f6d2a059e9356ce2","category":"Apple"}
