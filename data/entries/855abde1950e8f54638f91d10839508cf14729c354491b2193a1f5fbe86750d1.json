Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of $0.22 per share, payable on November 11 to shareholders of record as of November 8.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the full fiscal year, Apple shattered company records with $365.8 billion in sales and $94.7 billion in net income, up from $274.5 billion in sales and $57.4 billion in net income for fiscal 2020.<blockquote>“This year we launched our most powerful products ever, from M1-powered Macs to an iPhone 13 lineup that is setting a new standard for performance and empowering our customers to create and connect in new ways,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are infusing our values into everything we make — moving closer to our 2030 goal of being carbon neutral up and down our supply chain and across the lifecycle of our products, and ever advancing our mission to build a more equitable future.”</blockquote>As has been the case for well over a year now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in December.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/aapl-4q21-pie.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple will <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\">provide live streaming</a> of its fiscal Q4 2021 financial results conference call at 2:00 pm Pacific, and <em>MacRumors</em> will update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Conference call starts at 2:00 p.m. Pacific - No need to refresh</b> <img src=\"https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/loading.gif\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Loading live updates...</div>\r\n<br />\r\n \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">earnings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/apple-4q-2021-earnings/\">Apple Reports 4Q 2021 Results: $20.6B Profit on $83.4B Revenue</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reports-4q-2021-results-20-6b-profit-on-83-4b-revenue.2320345/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0AEyBP9eX_I:4zErcHTibAs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0AEyBP9eX_I:4zErcHTibAs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0AEyBP9eX_I\" />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"855abde1950e8f54638f91d10839508cf14729c354491b2193a1f5fbe86750d1","category":"Apple"}
