An Apple gift card! And right now, you can give yourself a little something if you buy Apple gift cards from Amazon. Amazon is offering a special promotion where you can get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A3BI4TFQ8GE4R3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$15 in Amazon credit if you buy $100 or more in Apple gift cards</a>. That $15 credit can come in handy with the rest of your holiday shopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take advantage of this offer, go to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A3BI4TFQ8GE4R3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon Apple card promo page</a>. Then select the Apple gift cards you want–the total value of the gift cards must be $100 or more to get the Amazon credit. When you go to check out, look for the notification that says you qualify for the $15 promotional credit. If you don’t see it, enter the promo code <strong>APPLENOV</strong> at checkout and apply it.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/amazon-credit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>Look for this notification when you check out to make sure you get the Amazon credit.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the credit is <em>Amazon</em> credit, not Apple credit, and counts only to your Amazon account. Only one credit is allowed per customer. This is a limited-time offer. Credits should arrive within three days. Also, it probably goes without saying but we’ll mention it anyway to be clear: the Apple gift cards cannot be used at Amazon and can only be used towards purchases at Apple stores or the App Stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Apple Cyber Monday Deals!</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541154/cyber-monday-apple-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553299/cyber-monday-macbook-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday MacBook deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553913/cyber-monday-mac-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Mac deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553018/cyber-monday-iphone-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday iPhone deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555651/cyber-monday-magsafe-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday MagSafe charger and accessory deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/554337/cyber-monday-ipad-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday iPad deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553124/cyber-monday-apple-watch-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple Watch deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553143/cyber-monday-airpods-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday AirPods deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555374/cyber-monday-apple-tv-homepod-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple TV and HomePod deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552862/cyber-monday-airtag-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday AirTag deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553617/apple-cyber-monday-sale.html\">Apple Cyber Monday sale</a></li></ul><figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"62d562a49aad886c9184f2bbc0f830d7540930244f6e487b8feff7f32fa57a7c","category":"Apple"}
