Apple cut orders\nbefore launching Vision Pro in non-US markets, which means that\ndemand in the US market has fallen sharply beyond expectations,\nmaking Apple take a conservative view of demand in non-US markets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilcybart/status/1782902900349419650\">Neil Cybart, on Twitter/X</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ming-Chi Kuo’s numbers and statements regarding Apple Vision Pro\nsales don’t make sense. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, when framing a 400K to 450K unit sales figure for\nVision Pro in 2024 (which would actually be a good result), Kuo\ncompares the range to a made up consensus figure of 700K to 800K\nunit sales. I don’t recall anyone running with such a high sales\nrange for Vision Pro in 2024. Instead, Kuo himself actually\nclaimed back on Feb 28th that a few suppliers were planning for\n700K to 800K production. That’s not the same as a sales forecast.\nFar from it. Kuo would know that too, so one is left to assume\nhe’s purposely being misleading.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ming-Chi Kuo occasionally uncovers legitimate scoops from Apple’s Asian supply chain. Ming-Chi Kuo also regularly inserts his own name into the news when he has no legitimate scoops. This is one of the latter. There was no “market consensus” that Apple would sell 700–800K Vision Pro units in 2024. In fact, the reporting has been around the 400–450K range since last summer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/apple-forced-to-make-major-cuts-to-vision-pro-headset-production-plans/\">The Financial Times, back on 3 July 2023</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two people close to Apple and Luxshare, the Chinese contract\nmanufacturer that will initially assemble the device, said it was\npreparing to make fewer than 400,000 units in 2024. Multiple\nindustry sources said Luxshare was currently Apple’s only\nassembler of the device. Separately, two China-based sole\nsuppliers of certain components for the Vision Pro said Apple was\nonly asking them for enough for 130,000 to 150,000 units in the\nfirst year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4559\">TheElec reported last June</a> that Sony only had the capacity to manufacture 900,000 OLED panels per year for Vision Pro, which, if true, would cap Vision Pro headset production at 450,000 units. <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-hopes-chinese-suppliers-can-solve-vision-pros-display-challenges?rc=jfy0lk\">The Information reported in August</a> that this display bottleneck “is one reason why Apple plans to make fewer than half a million Vision Pros in the first year of production”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/06/vision-pro-sales-are-going-just-about-as-expected\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"779bd9ec5248874f25f41b968e0e980be5099e2c3ce02e3b82f066f71c9aae06","category":"Tech"}
