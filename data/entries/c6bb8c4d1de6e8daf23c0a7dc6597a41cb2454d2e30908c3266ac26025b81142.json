At its Google I/O event in Mountain View, California, Google revealed that it already uses PaLM 2 to power 25 products, including its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/googles-chatgpt-killer-is-now-open-to-everyone-packing-new-features/\">Bard</a> conversational AI assistant.</p>\n\n<p>As a family of large language models (LLMs), PaLM 2 has been trained on an enormous volume of data and does next-word prediction, which outputs the most likely text after a prompt input by humans. PaLM stands for \"Pathways Language Model,\" and \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12533\">Pathways</a>\" is a machine-learning technique created at Google. PaLM 2 follows up on the <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html\">original PaLM</a>, which Google announced in April 2022.</p>\n<p>According to Google, PaLM 2 supports over 100 languages and can perform \"reasoning,\" code generation, and multi-lingual translation. During his 2023 Google I/O keynote, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that PaLM 2 comes in four sizes: Gecko, Otter, Bison, Unicorn. Gecko is the smallest and can reportedly run on a mobile device. Aside from Bard, PaLM 2 is behind AI features in Docs, Sheets, and Slides.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937904#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937904&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c6bb8c4d1de6e8daf23c0a7dc6597a41cb2454d2e30908c3266ac26025b81142","category":"Tech"}
