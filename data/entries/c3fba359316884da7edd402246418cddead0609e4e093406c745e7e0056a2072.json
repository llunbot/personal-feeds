Like many rural communities, these two villages of fishermen and farmers in the community of Mbiabet, tucked away in clearings within a dense palm forest, had never been connected to the country’s national electricity grid.</p>\n<p>Most of the residents had never heard of <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/technology/2021/the-dazzling-history-solar-power\">solar power</a> either. When, in 2021, a renewable-energy company proposed installing a solar “mini-grid” in their community, the villagers scoffed at the idea of the sun powering their homes. “We didn’t imagine that something [like this] can exist,” says Solomon Andrew Obot, a resident in his early 30s.</p>\n<p>The small installation of solar panels, batteries and transmission lines proposed by the company Prado Power would service 180 households in Mbiabet Esieyere and Mbiabet Udouba, giving them significantly more reliable electricity for a fraction of the cost of diesel generators. Village leaders agreed to the installation, though many residents remained skeptical. But when the panels were set up in 2022, lights blinked on in the brightly painted two-room homes and tan mud huts dotted sparsely through the community. At a village meeting in September, locals erupted into laughter as they recalled walking from house to house, turning on lights and plugging in phone chargers. “I [was] shocked,” Andrew Obot says.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/for-climate-and-livelihoods-africa-bets-big-on-solar-mini-grids/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/for-climate-and-livelihoods-africa-bets-big-on-solar-mini-grids/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Victoria Uwemedimo and Katarina Zimmer, Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c3fba359316884da7edd402246418cddead0609e4e093406c745e7e0056a2072","category":"Tech"}
