{"title":"EU Users Won’t Get Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, or the New SharePlay Screen Sharing Features This Year, Thanks to the DMA","link":"https://www.ft.com/content/360751cb-7a22-48e0-9b00-6a30ff41dcfe","date":1718989520000,"content":"\n<p>The Financial Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple blamed complexities in making the system compatible with EU\nrules that have forced it to make key parts of its iOS software\nand App Store services interoperable with third parties.</p>\n\n<p>“Due to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital\nMarkets Act,” Apple said on Friday, “we do not believe that we\nwill be able to roll out three of these features — iPhone\nMirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple\nIntelligence — to our EU users this year.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kudos to Apple for breaking this news to the Financial Times, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/17/ft-ec-aapl-dma\">of all outlets</a>. Poetry in media relations. Here’s the full on-the-record statement, provided to me by an Apple spokesperson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two weeks ago, Apple unveiled hundreds of new features that we are\nexcited to bring to our users around the world. We are highly\nmotivated to make these technologies accessible to all users.\nHowever, due to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the\nDigital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able\nto roll out three of these features — iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay\nScreen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence — to our EU\nusers this year.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, we are concerned that the interoperability\nrequirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the\nintegrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data\nsecurity. We are committed to collaborating with the European\nCommission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us\nto deliver these features to our EU customers without\ncompromising their safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>None of these features are available yet in the developer beta OS releases, but it is my understanding that the first two — iPhone Mirroring and the new SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements (where you’ll be able to see and doodle on the screens of others, like, say, if you’re providing remote how-to help to a friend or family member) — will be the next developer betas, coming early next week. Apple Intelligence won’t even enter beta until later this summer. But in the meantime, even in beta, none of these features will be available within the EU.</p>\n\n<p>The Mac is not considered a “gatekeeping” platform in the EU, but the iPhone and iPad are, and the iPhone Mirroring and screen sharing features obviously involve those platforms. I think Apple could try to thread a needle here and release Apple Intelligence <em>only</em> on the Mac in the EU, but given how inscrutable the European Commission’s interpretation of the DMA is — where gatekeepers are expected to somehow suss out the “spirit of the law” regardless of what the letter of the law says — I don’t see how Apple can be blamed for pausing the rollout in the EU, no matter the platform.</p>\n\n<p>The EU’s self-induced slide into a technological backwater continues.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-dma-financial-times\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"de0f9d6ea6019258538cc6ac794a7a6c59808f33c11af91c240bd75cfc9d4cfa","category":"Tech"}
