The 11-inch model is 5.3 mm thick and weighs less than a pound, while the 13-inch is 5.1 mm, which Apple says is its thinnest product ever, at 1.28 pounds.</p>\n<p>The tandem OLED design, dubbed Ultra Retina XDR, delivers 1000 nits at full-screen brightness, and 1600 nits at peak HDR, equivalent to a high-end Samsung TV. The screens are \"nano-texture glass,\" which is essentially a matte display finish.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022368#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022368&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4e936e7d3f1f5c8eb4a575d4815f65fe84c38f6a90e549981b251c1897ad3766","category":"Tech"}
