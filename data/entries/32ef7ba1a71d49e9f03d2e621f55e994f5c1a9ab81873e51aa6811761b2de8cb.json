I don’t know how you guys feel about it, but the year flew by for me. As the year comes to a close, I am tasked with remembering the products that I tested in 2024 and coming up with my favorites. This is always hard for me to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do feel very fortunate to do what I do for a living. And I am grateful that the brands trusted me with their products and stories. I also appreciate all of you who took the time to read and comment on some of my stories, I appreciate you guys and the kind/not-so-kind words that you’ve taken the time to write. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-do-bikes-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-do-bikes-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards do bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-do-bikes-jpeg.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-do-bikes-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-do-bikes-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-do-bikes-768x1024.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-kin-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"964\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-kin-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards kin\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-kin-jpeg.webp 964w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-kin-226x300.webp 226w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-kin-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-kin-768x1020.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The readers are at the heart of Bikerumor’s success.

I wish I could just pick one, not because I only have one favorite, but because I feel like it would be easier. Anywho, below are my faves in a few different categories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get to my Editor’s Choices for ’24.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Bike Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-beauty-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-beauty-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards beauty\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-beauty-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-beauty-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-beauty-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-beauty-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice: Overlanding Trip with K-EDGE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it seems weird to give my Editor’s Choice award for Best Bike Experience to an experience that didn’t <span>involve bikes. But, to be fair, this experience did happen <em>because</em> of bikes, with the planning for this event starting at the 2024 Sea Otter Classic</span>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler and I were hanging with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/k-edge-off-set-spacer-adapter-garmin-edge-1050/\" target=\"_blank\">K-EDGE</a> crew at their booth, enjoying some Coors Banquet and chips and salsa, which, over the past several years, has become somewhat of a tradition at Sea Otter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except this time, instead of talking bikes, and bike bits, we talked about and planned an Overlanding trip through a portion of the Owyhee Wilderness, which is located throughout South-Eastern Oregon and South-Western Idaho. And, just so happens to be the K-EDGE crew’s stomping ground. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler was planning a road trip from the East Coast to Portland, Oregon for the MADE Show, and he had to make a stop in Southern California. Since  I was headed up to Portland too for my second MADE Show experience, we decided to have him stop at my place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-camping-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-camping-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards camping\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-camping-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-camping-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-camping-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-camping-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Camping in Kalamath Falls, Oregon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Crater-lake-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Crater-lake-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Crater lake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Crater-lake-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Crater-lake-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Crater-lake-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Crater-lake-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Crater Lake</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He could park and camp in my backyard, and we could caravan up to Portland together over the next few days. That way, we could camp at some cool places along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Owyhee Wilderness Area was absolutely stunning. All of these photos do zero justice to this amazing place. My wife and I had an amazing time with the crew at K-EDGE as they showed off their incredible backyard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trip got my Editor’s Choice award, not because it was all about bikes, but because I would’ve never had the opportunity for such a beautiful trip with such beautiful people if it <em>wasn’t </em>for the bicycle and bicycle people. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

But, I also had the opportunity to review a few eMTBs, including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-ramblas-mid-drive-emtb-100nm-torque/\" target=\"_blank\">Aventon Ramblas</a>, and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-salsa-moraine-all-mountain-emtb/\" target=\"_blank\">Salsa Moraine</a>. The Aventon Ramblas was a fun bike, but the Salsa Moraine was an incredible bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Salsa Cycles Moraine Deore 12\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Cycles-Moraine-Deore-12-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement of the Salsa Moraine intrigued me at the 2024 Sea Otter Classic. After my Ramblas review, I was more eMTB curious than ever, so I thought I’d reach out to Salsa to bring a Moraine Deore 12 in for review.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Moraine-Blue-Ridege-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Moraine-Blue-Ridege-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Salsa Moraine Blue Ridege\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Moraine-Blue-Ridege-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Moraine-Blue-Ridege-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Moraine-Blue-Ridege-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Moraine-Blue-Ridege-768x578.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike uses the compact and lightweight Fazua Ride 60 for the assist. At 53lbs, the bike wasn’t very light for a “lightweight eMTB”, but it rode light and felt great. I loved riding the bike. I loved everything about the bike, even the mid-tier component spec. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Moraine’s geometry seemed to be perfect for me in the large size, making for a very comfortable bike. The suspension design and kinematics were impressive and familiar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Split Pivot design is a system that isolates pedaling and braking forces.

I wanted to buy the one I used for the review. But, lack of bike funds meant it didn’t work out. So I said goodbye, shipped it back to Salsa, and moved on with my life. Sometimes the hardest part of my job is saying goodbye to some of the bikes that I review.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Blackthorn-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Blackthorn-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Salsa Blackthorn\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Blackthorn-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Blackthorn-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Blackthorn-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Salsa-Blackthorn-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few weeks, I was strolling on Salsa’s website and came across a massive sale on their <a href=\"https://www.salsacycles.com/bikes/2023-blackthorn-c-xt\" target=\"_blank\">Blackthorn C XT</a> full-suspension mountain bike.

The soft compound helps keep the numbness at bay while providing ample damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ergonomics of the grip are subtle, but obvious as it keeps you in a riding position that is ready for action. And while the grip’s compound feels soft, its purposeful shape still feels very defined and precise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Hitch Rack</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice: 1UP USA 2″ Super Duty</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-haro-ready-to-rip-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-haro-ready-to-rip-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards 1UP USA Super Duty Hitch Rack haro ready to rip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-haro-ready-to-rip-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-haro-ready-to-rip-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-haro-ready-to-rip-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-1UP-USA-Super-Duty-Hitch-Rack-haro-ready-to-rip-768x578.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-new-improved-1up-usa-2024-super-duty-double-hitch-bike-rack/\" target=\"_blank\">1UP USA’s 2″ Super Duty</a> double hitch rack is a bike rack that’s rated for extreme off-roading.

better than others.

It is an aggressive trail, all-mountain, and enduro-type tire. I’m using the tire for mostly aggressive trail riding. And it’s at home in most of the conditions I ride in. I say most, because I’m not done reviewing it, and I have yet to ride in soft, wet, and sloppy conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As chance would have it, I’ve ridden this tire on the Salsa Moraine eMTB and loved it.

I really don’t notice the weight. Another thing that I like is that the Kessel does not seem hyper-sensitive to tire pressure. I don’t have to obsessively check pressure before a ride. The tire performs great regardless of small incremental changes in pressure. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-drain-jpeg-e1734389848741.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-drain-jpeg-e1734389848741.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-drain-jpeg-e1734389848741.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-drain-jpeg-e1734389848741-288x300.webp 288w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-drain-jpeg-e1734389848741-115x120.webp 115w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Teravail-Kessel-on-the-Blackthorn-drain-jpeg-e1734389848741-768x800.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I find that for a discipline-specific tire, it does a lot really well. It climbs great while the descending is predictable with traction and braking that inspires confidence. I am using the tire in a 2.6 up front matched with a 2.4 in the rear. I use this combo for both the Salsa Blackthorn and the Haro Saguaro 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-teravail-Kessel-on-Haro-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-teravail-Kessel-on-Haro-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards teravail Kessel on Haro\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-teravail-Kessel-on-Haro-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-teravail-Kessel-on-Haro-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-teravail-Kessel-on-Haro-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-teravail-Kessel-on-Haro-768x578.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Drop Bars</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice: Tumbleweed Bikes’ Big Dipper Drop Bar</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-top-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"879\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-top-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Tumbleweed Big Dipper bars top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-top-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-top-297x204.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-top-120x82.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-top-768x527.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me start by saying that I love the Tumbleweed Persuader Bars that I’ve used in the past. So when I saw that Daniel over at Tumbleweed Bicycles released the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tumbleweed-bicycle-co-big-dipper-drop-bar-handlebars/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Dipper Drop Bar</a> handlebar, I asked him if I could bring a pair in for review.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-logo-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-logo-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Tumbleweed Big Dipper bars logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-logo-jpeg.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-logo-120x80.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel designed the Big Dipper to pair perfectly with Tumbleweed’s drop bar adventure bike, the <a href=\"https://tumbleweed.cc/collections/bikes/products/stargazer?variant=43367492059317\" target=\"_blank\">Stargazer</a>. Ready for a good time, the Big Dipper drop bar is rated for off-road use (ISO 4210 mountain bike strength/fatigue testing). The bar has a clamping diameter of 31.8mm and is made of triple-butted 7000 series aluminum, which is stronger than 6000 series.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-ready-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-ready-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Tumbleweed Big Dipper bars ready\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-ready-jpeg.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-ready-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-ready-120x80.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a firm believer in the benefits of riding with wider handlebars.

According to Tumbleweed, the width is measured from center to center at the hoods. It has a shallow drop (109mm), a short reach (50mm), as well as a nice 5° back sweep. All of this is perfect for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-short-reach-shallow-drop-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-short-reach-shallow-drop-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Tumbleweed Big Dipper bars short reach shallow drop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-short-reach-shallow-drop-jpeg.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-short-reach-shallow-drop-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-short-reach-shallow-drop-120x80.webp 120w\" /></a><figcaption>Short Reach</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine all of that with a nice short reach of 50mm and the 20° flare, and the Big Dipper seems to be the perfect drop bar for me. The bar is so easy and comfy to go long distances. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-flare-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-flare-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Ron's Editor's Choice Awards Tumbleweed Big Dipper bars flare\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-flare-jpeg.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-flare-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rons-Editors-Choice-Awards-Tumbleweed-Big-Dipper-bars-flare-120x80.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the shallow drop, short reach, and 20-degree flare, it’s especially confidence-inspiring on technical descents, when you’re hard braking while in the drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Parting Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read what I write. I hope you all enjoyed the list, I had a great time this last year. Let me also thank all of the brands for their trust in letting me share my thoughts and opinions about your products. I look forward to another year of bikes and bike people! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See ya! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Each of these products was entirely chosen purely on their technical merits, by me personally, and for the reasons described above. More great products passed through my hands in 2024. Under no circumstances were any of my picks, paid for by their producers. Nor was any preference or favor given to the brand or advertiser. My selections are mostly (but not exclusively) limited to products I’ve actually spent time riding/testing in person. So a brand’s willingness to invite Bikerumor to join a launch event, or to provide product samples can make it more likely that we will have considered their products, if only because we can share our real, firsthand experiences.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-2024-ron-gear-of-the-year/\">BikeRumor Editor’s Choice 2024 – Ron’s Favorites of the Year</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"32ef7ba1a71d49e9f03d2e621f55e994f5c1a9ab81873e51aa6811761b2de8cb","category":"Cycling"}
