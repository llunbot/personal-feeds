The Japanese automaker has repeatedly impressed us with its keen understanding of vehicle dynamics and attention to details. But Mazda is only just bringing its first-generation battery electric vehicle—the MX-30 compact crossover—to market, at a time when <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/forget-the-looks-love-the-tech-the-83200-bmw-ix-electric-suv/\">other car makers are on their fifth</a>.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to dismiss the Mazda MX-30 just based on the numbers. The 100-mile (160 km) range will be the biggest hurdle for people to get over; that would have been a hard sell in 2014, let alone now in 2021. Then there's the fact that Mazda only plans to import 560 MX-30s for now, all bound for California. This is not an EV for the masses, something Mazda's PR people were upfront about. They openly describing the $33,470 (before federal tax credits) EV as a \"commuter car.\"</p>\n<p>And yet Mazda is the car company that built <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/the-mazda-cx-30-turbo-how-i-learned-to-love-the-crossover/\">a crossover that's more fun to drive</a> than most hot hatches. It has also churned out more than a million MX-5 Miatas. Which is why I went to California last week to find out whether the MX-30 is a rare Mazda misstep or if the boffins from Hiroshima had a surprise in store after all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800281#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800281&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
