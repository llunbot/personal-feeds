In the Classics she has won almost everything going, including the Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, Strade Bianche and Omloop Het Nieuwsblad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the longer stage races, Kopecky finished second in both the 2023 Tour de France Femmes (to then-teammate Vollering) and the 2024 Giro d’Italia (to Longo Borghini). At the 2023 Tour, Kopecky spent six days in yellow after winning the opening stage, but lost time on the Col d’Aspin and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-du-tourmalet-cycling\">Tourmalet</a> to drop down to fourth overall, before a strong ride in the final day time-trial lifted her back up to finish second, 3min 03sec down. Things were closer at last year’s Giro, with only one second separating her from Longo Borghini going into the final stage. Tried as she might, though, Kopecky was powerless to stop her Italian rival attacking in the finale to increase her lead to 21 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This season, with the departure of Vollering for FDJ-Suez, Kopecky has her sights on the Tour de France Femmes title. She also has to contend with the return of Van der Breggen, but despite her former dominance the two-time Road Race World Champion likely won’t stand in the way of Kopecky’s plans, or not immediately at least, instead putting her focus on enjoying racing and testing her form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teammates-to-rivals transition with Vollering (although they were still arguably rivals even when they were teammates) will be enthralling to watch, with the Dutchwoman determined to reclaim the Tour crown she lost in 2024 to Nieuwiadoma. It’s shaping up to be the showdown of the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/451317588_1395565334719004_7903870513878133037_n.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>RCS/Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>22-year-old Neve Bradbury had a breakthrough in 2024 including a second place behind Kopecky at the UAE Tour, her first pro win at the Tour de Suisse alongside teammate Niewiadoma, and an overall podium at the Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s here that the Australian can develop further with Niewiadoma no doubt a lock for the team’s Tour de France hopes. A spectacular victory on Blockhaus on Stage 7 of the 2024 Giro boosted her onto the podium with one day to go, a position she held onto on the final stage. On her way to that victory she left behind a group containing both Longo Borghini and Kopecky with an explosive attack in the final 10km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another podium should be on the cards for this season, and from there the sky is the limit for Bradbury.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

She may be one of two  riders on this list with ambitions of becoming the first French Tour de France Femmes winner, but even though FDJ-Suez are a French team, Vollering will likely be the team’s priority in terms of GC for the time being, so the Giro could be Labous’s best chance of Grand Tour success for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gaia Realini (Lidl-Trek)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240428LVF2063-Unipublic_SprintCyclingAgency.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Three was the magic number for Gaia Realini during her first season at WorldTour level, with her taking podiums at La Vuelta Femenina, Giro d’Italia Women and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-l-avenir-success\">Tour de l’Avenir</a>.

The 23-year-old has not shied away from showcasing her ambitions, however, and a Grand Tour in the next few years seems feasible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, she finished fifth at La Vuelta Femenina with a stage win to boot, beating Demi Vollering on La Laguna Negra. At the Tour de France, she raced to fourth thanks to an impressive ride on Alpe d’Huez. The mountains are very much her playground and some improvement in other areas such as time-trialling could help her bid for overall contention in years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0045-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pauliena Rooijakkers’s 2024 was eye-catching. The 31-year-old finished fourth at the Giro and on the podium at the Tour thanks to her strong legs in the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Giro, she was initially dropped on Blockhaus by Kopecky and Longo Borghini but raced at her own speed to bring herself back into the group in the final 4km. This persistence was also evident at the Tour, where she rose up the general classification all the way to the podium thanks to an impressive showing on Alpe d’Huez, where she was the only one that was able to stick with Vollering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025 she looks to be the rider Fenix-Deceuninck are pinning their hopes on in the big races, with Puck Pieterse key for the Classics while continuing her own Grand Tour development after winning the white jersey for best young rider at last year’s Tour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some of the other riders on this list have strong results in other stage races too, however, Rooijakkers does not. Sixth at the UAE Tour, 19th at Itzulia, 12th at the Tour de Romandie in 2024 are results she’ll be looking to improve on, though if she can peak for the Grand Tours then who cares?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Justine Ghekiere (AG Insurance-Soudal)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/20240818TDFFAZ0053-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Justine Ghekiere has been sweeping up mountains classifications in Grand Tours, claiming the climbers’ jersey at both the Giro and Tour last year.
