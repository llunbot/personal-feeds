Skylo uses licensed mobile satellite spectrum that avoids interference with terrestrial signals to provide coverage in remote areas where there isn't traditional cellular signal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSatellite texting through Verizon is only available for Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones, and unlike T-Mobile's Starlink integration, Verizon isn't able to expand the Skylo satellite texting option to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users because it requires specific smartphone hardware.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPhone‌ users with an ‌iPhone‌ 14 or later already have access to satellite-based texting as of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> using the ‌iPhone‌'s built-in satellite connectivity available through Globalstar, but the option to connect to satellites from a second satellite company could increase the chance of being able to communicate in remote and rural areas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/ios-18-3-starlink-t-mobile-support/\">added Starlink support</a> to T-Mobile iPhones with iOS 18.3, and T-Mobile subscribers are able to connect to Starlink for satellite-based texting thanks to a public beta test <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/t-mobile-starlink-public-beta-for-iphones/\">that T-Mobile is offering</a>. Compared to Apple's built-in satellite option, Starlink has more available satellites and smartphones can connect automatically without needing to hold a device up to the sky.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Verizon's Skylo satellite texting isn't available on the ‌iPhone‌ right now, Verizon is working on other satellite technology. The company is <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-conquers-remaining-dead-zones-test-man-buzz-aldrin\">partnering with AST SpaceMobile</a> to offer customers direct-to-cellular AST SpaceMobile service when terrestrial mobile networks are unavailable. When Verizon's AST SpaceMobile satellite partnership is ready, Verizon will likely be able to offer satellite texting for both ‌iPhone‌ and Android users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAST SpaceMobile and Verizon plan to provide satellite connectivity that supports text, voice, and video calling capabilities. AST SpaceMobile currently has FCC approval to test five commercial BlueBird satellites with smartphones.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/verizon/\">Verizon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/verizon-new-satellite-texting-feature/\">Verizon's New Satellite Texting Service Isn't for iPhone Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/verizons-new-satellite-texting-service-isnt-for-iphone-users.2453524/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3475710eae648bd9e6bdb079102bf8dede5a745c6b394499eef1b69bfddddf9","category":"Apple"}
