Apple's October event will be about the Mac, and the company is expected to refresh several Macs in the lineup. Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">Events website</a> features an Apple logo on a black background that morphs into the Mac Finder icon, confirming the event's Mac focus. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-october-scary-fast-event.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAs with prior events, this October event will be prerecorded, and it will be held online only with no in-person component.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMac rumors have been confusing in recent months, but there are several possibilities. We could see a refreshed version of the 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, as that machine is still using an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon chip. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> has said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/\">not to expect a MacBook Air refresh</a>, but the 13-inch MacBook Pro, 14-inch MacBook Pro, and 16-inch MacBook Pro could potentially get new chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not clear if the refresh will focus on new M3-series chips, but depending on what's being overhauled, we could see the ‌iMac‌ and the MacBook Pro models adopting the 3-nanometer M3 chip lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nGiven the confusion surrounding the Mac lineup right now, this is one of the more mysterious events we've had, though we are likely to hear more as October 30 approaches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to stream the event <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">live on its website</a>, on YouTube, and through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage on MacRumors.com and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple Event</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/\">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/\">Apple Announces October Event for Macs: 'Scary Fast'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-october-event-for-macs-scary-fast.2408536/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"45035f33d372a806a1554a9aa51fa7e34b332ca84a2afd64d68f37f228416a45","category":"Apple"}
