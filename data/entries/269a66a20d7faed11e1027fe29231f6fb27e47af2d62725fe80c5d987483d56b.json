I’ve ridden it on four bikes now, and have one at home. It truly changes how you ride a mountain bike. It really delivers more confidence &amp; control at high speeds, through rough stuff, and in the air. Although it does make you slightly relearn bike handling at slow speeds in the steeps. It’s fun, it’s weird, and you can always dial it back or even disconnect it if you don’t feel like it’s improving your ride. But it’s surely worth everyone trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB_progressive-ebike-geoemtry-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB_progressive-ebike-geoemtry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral:ONfly lightweight all-mountain trail eMTB powered by TQ, progressive ebike geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB_progressive-ebike-geoemtry-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB_progressive-ebike-geoemtry-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB_progressive-ebike-geoemtry-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB_progressive-ebike-geoemtry-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB_progressive-ebike-geoemtry-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Key to the Spectral:ONfly versatility is the same proven enduro-level-tested carbon tech from the rest of the Spectral family (Category 4E), but of course adapted a bit. While the latest Spectral dialed back to 150/140mm of travel, this ebike keeps 160mm up front paired to 150mm in the back. That owes a bit to the heavier eMTB weight, but also to the fact that the pedal-assist support makes it easier to get in over your head on gnarly trails far from home, so a little extra squish is appreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry is also only gently tweaked – just no flipchips, though. For starters, all Spectral:ONfly models get mullet wheel combos – 29″ up front for business, 27.5″ for the party in the back. That helps keep chainstays to just 440mm (only 3mm longer than the 29er Spectral setting). Other than that the 64° headtube and 76.5 effective seat tube angles are unchanged. And Stack &amp; Reach figures for the 4 sizes (S-XL) are pretty much identical to this ebike’s regular pedal-powered trail bike siblings. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024 Canyon Spectral:ONfly – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral:ONfly lightweight all-mountain trail eMTB ebike powered by TQ, non-driveside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_non-driveside-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Canyon Spectral:ONfly range includes four complete all-mountain ebike builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_CF-LTD-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_CF-LTD-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral:ONfly CF LTD light trail eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_CF-LTD-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_CF-LTD-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_CF-LTD-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_CF-LTD-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Spectral-ONfly-lightweight-all-mountain-trail-eMTB-ebike-powered-by-TQ_CF-LTD-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>2024 Canyon Spectral:ONfly CF LTD</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The absolute top-of-the-line, and the one best suited to emptying your pocketbook is this 9000€ Canyon Spectral:ONfly CF LTD.
