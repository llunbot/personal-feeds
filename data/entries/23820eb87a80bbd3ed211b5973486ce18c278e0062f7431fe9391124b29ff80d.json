The tread blocks are lower than those found on the Magic Mary, while being narrower than the Big Betty.</p>\n<p>The side knobs look to be very similar to those found on the Magic Mary, which is known for its excellent cornering grip.</p>\n<p>Given the new tyre is only fitted on the rear, we can’t confirm if it is designed for use on the front end as well.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tyres use Schwalbe’s Addix compound.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Commencal</i></span></div>\n<p>The logos on the sidewall of the tyres show they use Schwalbe’s Addix Super Soft compound and Super DH tubeless casing.</p>\n<p>Looking closer, the tyre appears to be called the Hunting Holly, though the name has been blacked out.</p>\n<p>Schwalbe’s First Ride programme is for its team riders to develop and test new rubber compounds, tyre casings and tread patterns, and this hot patch on the sidewall indicates it’s still in the development stage.</p>\n<p>However, creating tyre moulds is not cheap, so again, this could be a sign the tyres are close to being released.</p>\n<h2>TRP’s new EVO drivetrain in the wild</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bikes also use TRP’s new drivetrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Commencal</i></span></div>\n<p>The Meta Team is equipped with TRP’s new EVO12 crankset, shifter and rear derailleur, but not its chain and cassette, instead using a SRAM X01 Eagle cassette and a black XX1 Eagle chain.</p>\n<p>The EVO name already exists in the TRP range with its DH-R EVO brakes, so this fits with the current naming structure.</p>\n<p>The EVO12 group features a refined derailleur and all-new shifter, as well as the option of carbon or aluminium cranks. The Meta Team is equipped with the latter.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, a chain and cassette are part of the groupset, but are not present on the bike.</p>\n<p>For full details on the new TRP EVO12 drivetrain, check out <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/trp-evo12-drivetrain/\">our dedicated news story</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Commencal Meta Team says no to annoying internal routing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are few details available on the new Meta Team.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Commencal</i></span></div>\n<p>Precious few details have been given about the new Commencal Meta Team.</p>\n<p>The bike moves away from the linkage-actuated single-pivot design of the current Meta AM, adopting the twin-link Virtual Contact System from the recently launched Tempo downcountry/trail bike.
