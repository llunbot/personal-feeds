Onin is a free iPhone keyboard app that puts your calendar right in your keyboard. Or is it a calendar app that adds a keyboard? Whichever way you want to look at it, it’s a very clever idea. Most people only add a fraction of their events they work out in a messaging app in their calendar. With Onin, you can check your availability, add new events, and even share invites — right inside <em>any</em> app where you use the keyboard. It works with all your existing calendars (after granting it access), in all your apps, and is end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>It’s free and fun — I say check it out.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/21/onin\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"caa653c689f00fd5aab87bbefbe0bd92f0bcb0c1c53d82cc9d5e9abe57a16e57","category":"Tech"}
