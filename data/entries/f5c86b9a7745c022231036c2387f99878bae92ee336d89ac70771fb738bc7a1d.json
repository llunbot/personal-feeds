To me, it was some sort of a roadmap or a “grand vision”, with a few business decisions attached to it. And looking back now, I realize that I was wrong all along.</p>\n<p>UX Strategy isn’t a goal; it’s a <strong>journey towards that goal</strong>. A journey connecting where UX is today with a desired future state of UX. And as such, it guides our actions and decisions, things we do and don’t do. And its goal is very simple: to <strong>maximize our chances of success</strong> while considering risks, bottlenecks and anything that might endanger the project.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore the <strong>components of UX strategy</strong>, and how it works with product strategy and business strategy to deliver user value and meet business goals.</p>\nStrategy vs. Goals vs. Plans\n<p>When we speak about strategy, we often speak about planning and goals — but they are actually quite different. While <em>strategy</em> answers <strong>“what” we’re doing and “why”</strong>, <em>planning</em> is about “how” and “when” we’ll get it done. And the <em>goal</em> is merely a desired outcome of that entire journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goals</strong> establish a desired future outcome,</li>\n<li>That outcome typically represents a problem to solve,</li>\n<li><strong>Strategy</strong> shows a high-level solution for that problem,</li>\n<li><strong>Plan</strong> is a detailed set of low-level steps for getting the solution done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/1-strategy-vs-goal.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>A strong strategy requires making conscious, and oftentimes tough, decisions about what we will do — and just as importantly, <strong>what we will not do</strong>, and why.</p>\nBusiness Strategy\n<p>UX strategy doesn’t live in isolation. It must inform and support product strategy and be aligned with business strategy. All these terms are often slightly confusing and overloaded, so let's clear it up.</p>\n<p>At the highest level, <strong>business strategy</strong> is about the distinct choices executives make to set the company apart from its competitors. They shape the company’s positioning, objectives, and (most importantly!) <strong>competitive advantage</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/2-business-model-canvas.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Typically, this advantage is achieved in <strong>two ways</strong>: through lower prices (cost leadership) or through <strong>differentiation</strong>. The latter part isn't about being <em>different</em>, but rather <strong>being perceived differently</strong> by the target audience. And that’s exactly where UX impact steps in.</p>\n<p>In short, business strategy is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A top-line vision</strong>, basis for core offers,</li>\n<li><strong>Shapes positioning</strong>, goals, competitive advantage,</li>\n<li><strong>Must always adapt</strong> to the market to keep a competitive advantage.</li>\n</ul>\nProduct Strategy\n<p>Product strategy is how a high-level business direction is translated into a unique positioning of a product. It defines <strong>what the product is, who its users are</strong>, and how it will contribute to the business’s goals. It’s also how we bring a product to market, drive growth, and achieve product-market fit.</p>\n<p>In short, product strategy is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unique positioning</strong> and value of a product,</li>\n<li><strong>How to establish</strong> and keep a product in the marketplace,</li>\n<li><strong>How to keep competitive advantage</strong> of the product.</li>\n</ul>\nUX Strategy\n<p>UX strategy is about <strong>shaping and delivering</strong> product value through UX. Good UX strategy always stems from UX research and answers to business needs. It established what to focus on, what our high-value actions are, how we’ll measure success, and — quite importantly — what <strong>risks</strong> we need to mitigate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/8-risks-ux-strategy.png\" /></p>\n<p>Most importantly, it’s <strong>not a fixed plan</strong> or a set of deliverables; it’s a guide that informs our actions, but also must be prepared to change when things change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/3-components-ux-strategy.png\" /></p>\n<p>In short, UX strategy is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How we shape and deliver <strong>product value</strong> through UX,</li>\n<li><strong>Priorities</strong>, focus + why, actions, metrics, risks,</li>\n<li><strong>Isn’t a roadmap</strong>, intention or deliverables.</li>\n</ul>\nSix Key Components of UX Strategy\n<p>The impact of good UX typically lives in <strong>differentiation</strong> mentioned above. Again, it’s not about how “different” our experience is, but the unique perceived value that users associate with it. And that value is a matter of a clear, frictionless, accessible, fast, and reliable experience wrapped into the product.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/4-what-ux-strategy.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I always try to include <strong>6 key components</strong> in any strategic UX work so we don’t end up following a wrong assumption that won’t bring any impact:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Target goal</strong><br />The desired, improved future state of UX.</li>\n<li><strong>User segments</strong><br />Primary users that we are considering.</li>\n<li><strong>Priorities</strong><br />What we will and, crucially, what we will not do, and why.</li>\n<li><strong>High-value actions</strong><br />How we drive value and meet user and business needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Feasibility</strong><br />Realistic assessment of people, processes, and resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Risks</strong><br />Bottlenecks, blockers, legacy constraints, big unknowns.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s worth noting that it’s always dangerous to be designing a product with <strong>everybody in mind</strong>. As Jamie Levy noted, by being very broad too early, we often reduce the impact of our design and messaging. It’s typically better to start with a specific, <strong>well-defined user segment</strong> and then expand, rather than the other way around.</p>\nPractical Example (by Alin Buda)\n<p>UX strategy doesn’t have to be a big <strong>40-page long PDF report</strong> or a Keynote presentation. A while back, Alin Buda kindly <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-design-activity-7313819542655299585-ya-L?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAACDcgQBa_vsk5breYKwZAgyIhsHtJaFbL8\">left a comment</a> on one of my LinkedIn posts, giving a great example of what a <strong>concise UX strategy</strong> could look like:</p>\n<blockquote><strong>UX Strategy (for Q4)</strong><br /><br />Our UX strategy is to focus on <strong>high-friction workflows</strong> for expert users, not casual usability improvements. Why? Because retention in this space is driven by power-user efficiency, and that aligns with our growth model.<br /><br />To succeed, we’ll design <strong>workflow accelerators</strong> and decision-support tools that will reduce time-on-task. As a part of it, we’ll need to redesign legacy flows in the Crux system. We <strong>won’t prioritize</strong> UI refinements or onboarding tours, because it doesn’t move the needle in this context.</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/5-ux-strategy-example.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/6-ux-strategy-example.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>What I like most about this example is just how concise and clear it is. Getting to this level of clarity takes quite a bit of time, but it creates a very precise overview of what we do, what we don't do, what we focus on, and how we <strong>drive value</strong>.</p>\nWrapping Up\n<p>The best path to make a strong case with senior leadership is to frame your UX work as a direct <strong>contributor to differentiation</strong>. This isn’t just about making things look different; it’s about enhancing the perceived value.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/key-components-ux-strategy/7-elements-product-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>A good strategy ties UX improvements to <strong>measurable business outcomes</strong>. It doesn’t speak about design patterns, consistency, or neatly organized components. Instead, it speaks the language of product and business strategy: OKRs, costs, revenue, business metrics, and objectives.</p>\n<p>Design <strong>can succeed without a strategy</strong>. In the wise words of Sun Tzu, strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. And tactics without strategy are the noise before defeat.</p>\nMeet “How To Measure UX And Design Impact”\n<p>You can find more details on <strong>UX Strategy</strong> in 🪴 <a href=\"https://measure-ux.com/\"><strong>Measure UX &amp; Design Impact</strong></a> (8h), a practical guide for designers and UX leads to measure and show your UX impact on business.
