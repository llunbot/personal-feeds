But I’ll have to <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&amp;utm_term=scsf-608209&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnEIAS&amp;scsonar=1\">learn a new language</a> or a few. Since Babbel is one of the highest-rated apps on the App Store, I’ll try it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld is offering a huge discount on Babbel for Cyber Week: <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&amp;utm_term=scsf-608209&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnEIAS&amp;scsonar=1\">$129.97 for lifetime access</a>, normally $599. I got special word that this offer ends on December 8, so I’m getting my subscription now and testing out the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d love to live in Germany, so I’m selecting German from the 14 options. The <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&amp;utm_term=scsf-608209&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnEIAS&amp;scsonar=1\">language-learning app</a> is asking me to set a daily learning goal, so I’ll commit to 10 minutes a day. The first lesson is teaching me how to greet people and say goodbye — that’ll come in handy when I’m packing my bags and moving abroad!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next few lessons are asking me to speak in German. I’m not good at it, but Babbel tells me my pronunciation is enough to move on. Tomorrow, I’ll probably do a personalized review lesson to lock everything in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&amp;utm_term=scsf-608209&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnEIAS&amp;scsonar=1\">Babbel lifetime subscription</a> for $129.97 (reg. $599) through December 8 at 11:59 p.m. PT with no coupon needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&amp;utm_term=scsf-608209&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnEIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp3.stackassets.com/803501534e4f3a75e82d16033fcc6b9a9825fda3/store/ce05162579f37f3f58a112b4e40388fcb2c13ead8ef34dc60c2d72f2a2c2/sale_136716_primary_image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Babbel Language Learning: Lifetime Subscription (All Languages) – $129.97</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&amp;utm_term=scsf-608209&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnEIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change.  </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"07ebaf04313889c6a23677d76fb1ec6b2fd77730215ed1f1f40e44cb7663a589","category":"Apple"}
