In January, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/foldable-ipad-kickstand-2024/\">foldable iPad would launch in 2024</a>, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1620118307578970112?\">Mark Gurman</a> and Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1620482467546398721\">Ross Young</a> said they had not heard anything about such a device at the time. Kuo said the foldable iPad would feature an all-new design and a lightweight and durable carbon fiber kickstand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike foldable smartphones from brands such as Samsung and Google, a foldable iPad would have a hinge that allows the device to be opened and closed like a book, resulting in a much larger display than existing models when it is unfolded. A foldable iPad would likely be positioned above the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which starts at $1,099.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to release any devices with foldable displays, but rumors suggest the company is considering all options over the long term, including a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/\">foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/foldable-ipad-kickstand-2024/\">iPad</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-exploring-20-inch-foldable-macbook/\">Mac</a>. It remains to be seen if Apple ever releases any of these devices, or if the plans will remain limited to the research and development stage.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-considering-foldable-ipad-digitimes/\">Apple Considering Foldable iPad, According to Supply Chain Sources</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considering-foldable-ipad-according-to-supply-chain-sources.2396851/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6a216b2e7e20843bf4df73e2be0ca828c08ffdd69f2f1d5c94a3aca9dcc21b85","category":"Apple"}
