One day I noticed a <a href=\"https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/33287178452\">Ryobi inflator</a> on sale at Home Depot for about $20 and thought, “huh, I bet I could just get a <a href=\"https://prestacycle.com/products/prestacycle-ez-grip-elastomer-presta-big-head\">presta adaptor</a> and use the inflator as a bike pump.” Viola! I’m never going back. I keep this thing by the front door of my hosue and throw it in the truck for trips. It does require a battery which costs much more than the tool itself. If you already have some form of power tool, you can find all kinds of adapters between brands, I originally had a Dewalt to Ryobi adaptor for this. This thing won’t seat your tubeless tires, but it makes those top-0ffs real quick and painless. Embrace your lazy side and treat yourself.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-7.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-5.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-6.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/33287178452\">Smith Engage MIPS Helmet</a></h3>\n<p>I snagged this <a href=\"https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/engage-mtb-helmet/E007573OE6165.html\">Smith Engage helmet</a> from my local shop when it was on sale for $60. Sixty bucks for an MIPS helmet in sweet colors that is quite comfortable.  I normally have to size up to a large or even XL but the Engage fits me in a reasonable size Medium. It’s a sizing slam dunk for my oblong head. I wish the visor was 50% bigger but, besides that, I love this helmet.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-8.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-9.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-10.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/collections/grips\">Ergon Grips</a></h3>\n<p>I love me some paddle grips.

But losing that one caused me to look at what is available now and I’m stoked about the new crop of bike bag-shaped bladders. I had the lower compartment on my custom framebag from <a href=\"https://roguepanda.com/products/custom-frame-bag\">Rogue Panda</a> for my Crust Scapebot sized for a 3L bladder from <a href=\"https://www.apidura.com/shop/frame-pack-hydration-bladder/\">Apidura.</a> I love it. 3L is almost as much water as I ever need to carry and only takes up about ⅓ of my framebag space.

These particular handlebars have lived on a few bikes this past year, but have ended up on my Ripley AF after a CT trip that had my lower back aching. All the rise and none of the downsides of heavy steel bars. These cost a pretty penny but they’ve been worth every cent.

href=\"https://www.thermarest.com/sleeping-pads/trek-and-travel/ridgerest-classic-sleeping-pad/06433.html\">Thermarest RidgeRest</a></h3>\n<p>After a few years of trying to make an inflatable sleeping pad work for me, I’m back to good old rolled foam. I love throwing it down for snack stops and when I get to camp. I don’t have to worry about it popping either. I’m a side sleeper that moves around a lot during the night and my inflatable pad always moved around a ton, my pillow would slip, and it was just a mess. The foam RidgeRest stays put and keeps me cozy enough. I am more keen on the classic <a href=\"https://www.thermarest.com/sleeping-pads/trek-and-travel/ridgerest-classic-sleeping-pad/06433.html\">RidgeRest</a> over the Zlite as the RidgeRest is a thicker and denser foam that, in my experience, lasts much longer. The hard part is packing it on a bike in a clean and cool way.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-30.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-31.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Spencer-Top-Products-32.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://topodesigns.com/products/global-shirt-mens?variant=42124647694389\">Topo Designs Global Shirt</a></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://topodesigns.com/products/global-shirt-mens?variant=42124647694389\">Global Shirt</a> has quickly become my go-to shirt for mountain biking and gravel alike.

A fateful free pile after a neighbor moved out left me with a large box of Magic cards. I figured it was about time to learn this game I’d heard so much about dating back to when I was a kid. Now I have ten decks I’ve mostly built from scratch and a lovely excuse to hang with friends at the kitchen table and do something that isn’t bikes. It has been such a great diversion from my usual outdoorsy activities. Though a digital version of the game exists I have zero interest in it. Actually holding cards and sitting with my friends is the only way I want to play. Turns out there are quite a few Planeswalkers in the bike community as well. It all comes full circle.</p>\n<p>From picking up a reconstructed deck to spending hours looking for the right janky cards to finish my Rube Goldberg machine, I’ve really fallen in love with the game. It gets me away from my computer and phone and just enjoying friends’ company and, most importantly, doing wizard shit. I could go on and on, but I leave you with a spread of my personal commander decks pictured above.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I’m far from an audiophile like John, but I’ve been trying to dive back into the music world a bit this year. I also don’t listen to many full albums, but the ones listed below have been on heavy rotation for me this year. Enjoy!</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<div></div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://archspire.bandcamp.com/album/bleed-the-future\">Archspire – Bleed the Future</a></h3>\n<p>This is a more recent discovery for me. Somewhere in the middle of Dragon Force and Between The Buried and Me. The tracks <em>Golden Mouth of Ruin </em>and <em>Abandon the Linear</em> really hit. If your calves and fingertips don’t ache to imagine the sheer shreddage in those two songs, you are lost. Crank it up and leave it there.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://sturgillsimpson.bandcamp.com/album/high-top-mountain\">Sturgill Simpson – High Top Mountain</a></h3>\n<p><em>You Can Have the Crown </em>became an anthem for me while guiding on the Green River this past summer. I wound up rowing a massive raft with all the groovers (poop) many times. I decided to rename my boat <em>Shit Mountain</em> and made guests refer to me as King Turd. Come for the silly stories and stay for the rest of the classics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://dancegavindanceband.com/\">Dance Gavin Dance – Jackpot Juicer</a></h3>\n<p>There’s no escaping my being an early aughts metalcore scene kid in LA. Somehow I never listened to Dance Gavin Dance back in the day, but I’m glad to have recently found this album to break up all the trips down memory lane. <em>Cream of the Crop, Die Another Day</em>, and <em>Ember</em> are tour de force on this record.</p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://intervalsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/circadian\">Intervals – Circadian</a></h3>\n<p>You are probably starting to see the instrumental metal side of this year for me. I’ve been spending more time reading and editing for the Radavist lately and having music without lyrics helps me focus, but it just has to be intense.<em> 5-HTP, Signal Hill,</em> and <em>D.O.S.E</em> have been on heavy repeat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://julienbaker.bandcamp.com/album/turn-out-the-lights\">Julien Baker – Turn Out the Lights</a></h3>\n<p>As the great Pubes says, “Life is f*cky sometimes” and for those days there is Julien Baker. When Tucson has one overcast day I get sad as shit immediately and put this album on. We all need to be sad boys sometimes.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://dakotahallscott.bandcamp.com/album/my-body-longed-for-the-summer\">D.H. Scott – My Body Longed for the Summer</a></h3>\n<p>I know Dakota from back in my LA warehouse days, you can even find a photo of him from my deep dive into my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/to-everyone-who-hoped-it-might-be-true-a-deep-dive-into-spencer-hardings-film-archive/\">old medium-format photos</a>. He would routinely pop in and play in the various permutations of bands in the friend group. I’ve been enamored with his latest release and enjoying his somber and thoughtful songs. Go listen on <a href=\"https://dakotahallscott.bandcamp.com/album/my-body-longed-for-the-summer\">Bandcamp.</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>I know<span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://allswordsburn.bandcamp.com/album/wearer-of-numerous-forms\">Eremit – Wearer of Numerous Forms</a></h3>\n<p>I’m not as good as John at this doom-metal stuff, but this album really struck a chord with me. It plays like a fantasy novel as they spin a tale throughout their albums. I don’t know what is going on, but I love it. Let the reverb soothe your soul.</p>\n<h3><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span>” src=”&lt;iframe width=” height=”315″ frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen=”allowfullscreen”&gt;” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen=”allowfullscreen”&gt;</h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https://nyusteez.bandcamp.com/album/flux\">Nyu. – Flux</a></h3>\n<p>This is my album of the year, but it was released in 2018. I’m a bit late to the party. After sifting through a sea of uninspiring instrumental metal I stumbled on this album. I could listen to <em>Tesla</em> on repeat all damn day.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/\">Behind the Bastards</a></h3>\n<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t include my most heavily listened-to podcast this year, <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/\">Behind the Bastards</a>. Come learn all the f*cked up history you were never taught about the worst people in history. It’s well-researched and usually co-hosted by a comedian to make the dark humor all the darker. Want to ruin all your liberal friends’s ideas about the world? Well, then you should listen to this podcast. I highly recommend the sagas on L. Ron Hubbard and Vince McMahon.  <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-inner-passage-of-cochise-stronghold-rock-climbing-bikepacking/\">Tyler</a> and I are still scheming how to get Robert Evans to come bikepacking with us.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/spencers-favorite-products-of-2023/\">Spencer’s Favorite Products of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"826380632791c508a986f9d37d0f5bfc4349719bc104b35aef161d2d6d27308f","category":"Cycling"}
