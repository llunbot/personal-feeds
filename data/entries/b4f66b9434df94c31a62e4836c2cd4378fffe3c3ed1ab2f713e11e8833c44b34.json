Apple assesses all requests to determine whether they fall into the appropriate article of the DMA, and if so, Apple will design a solution for effective interoperability. Apple warns that the integrity of iOS and iPadOS are \"important considerations\" and that it may not be feasible for the company to design an effective interoperability solution.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn response to Apple's comments on Meta's requests, Meta said the following: \"What Apple is actually saying is they donâ€™t believe in interoperability. Every time Apple is called out for its anticompetitive behavior, they defend themselves on privacy grounds that have no basis in reality.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's complaint about Meta comes as the European Union has <a href=\"https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/dma100204-consultation-proposed-measures-requesting-interoperability-apples-ios-and-ipados-operating_en\">shared preliminary findings</a> on proposed measures that Apple should implement for improved interoperability. The European Commission says that Apple needs to give developers a better overview of the iOS components that provide functionalities reserved to Apple, plus Apple is required to design a better process that makes it easier to submit interoperability requests. Apple must also adhere to stricter timelines and avoid delays providing feedback on requested features. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe European Commission is now consulting interested third parties on whether its preliminary findings are sufficient to make Apple's request-based process effective. The EC says that the measures could be adjusted based on feedback from Apple and from third parties.\r<br />\n<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/apple-meta-interoperability-requests-dma/\">Apple Says Meta is Making Unreasonable Interoperability Requests Under Europe's DMA Requirements</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-meta-is-making-unreasonable-interoperability-requests-under-europes-dma-requirements.2445750/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4f66b9434df94c31a62e4836c2cd4378fffe3c3ed1ab2f713e11e8833c44b34","category":"Apple"}
