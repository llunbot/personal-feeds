It’s a classic desert scene illustrated through clever, minimalist tread design, sure to leave a memorable tire print on your dusty gravel rides. Faraway’s 40c size is a great footprint for efficient travel on mixed surfaces, excelling particularly well at hardpack gravel.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-99.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-99.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-99.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-99.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"SimWorks Tomii Cycles Faraway Tire\" /></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Faraway is initially offered solely in a 700 x 40c size, in 2 tread color options: Sand Beige and Black. The tire is tubeless compatible, advised for use with hooked rims, and has a construction nearly identical to the newly updated The Homage tire, specified to be tubeless compatible. The tire will be available directly to consumers through both SimWorks and Tomii web stores. Dealer sales will be offered through SimWorks.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-106.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-106.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-106.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-106.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"SimWorks Tomii Cycles Faraway Tire\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/SimWorks-Tomii-Cycles-Faraway-Info.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/SimWorks-Tomii-Cycles-Faraway-Info.png?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/SimWorks-Tomii-Cycles-Faraway-Info.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/SimWorks-Tomii-Cycles-Faraway-Info.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"SimWorks Tomii Cycles Faraway Tire\" /></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Packaging for this tire is premium as well, with the box (our first tire offered in a box) designed in collaboration with Nao Tomii and the SimWorks Japan crew. This is the first SimWorks tire to sell in a box.</p>\n<p>All that’s left after a transformative ride is our memories and the fleeting tracks of our tires, so we should ensure that the marks we leave behind are beautiful. Faraway will take you there.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-61.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-61.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-61.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/Tomii.Simworks.Tires-61.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"SimWorks Tomii Cycles Faraway Tire\" /></p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.sim.works/products/simworks-x-tomii-cycles-faraway\">Faraway</a> at <a href=\"https://www.sim.works\">SimWorks</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/faraway-tire-from-simworks-and-tomii-cycles/\">Faraway Tire from SimWorks and Tomii Cycles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Nicholas Haig-Arack","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e16711c200ac43f7831b3cb3ed6cd50ae3eb4b914580a35e8d1031f8aea074b1","category":"Cycling"}
