No matter what type of bike or where you ride, having a bicycle stolen is soul-crushing – and stolen bicycles are rarely recovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are a recreational road, gravel, or mountain biker, a commuter, or someone who relies solely on their bike for transportation, bike theft will impact your life negatively. And, with the price of high-end road, gravel, and mountain bikes, this can potentially be a large budget consideration, no matter your means. Even worse, if you rely on your bike as your primary mode of transportation, the monetary loss could be compounded by missing work and paying for alternative transportation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike thieves are terrible, opportunistic, and tenacious people who will take advantage of an easy win. Locking your bike is a powerful deterrent that will greatly mitigate the risk of your ride disappearing – and you should certainly be using one anytime your bike is unattended anywhere but inside of your home. But which lock will give you the best protection? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many locks available, choosing the right one can be a hard choice. To help, we tested 12 of the best bike locks available in 2023. We used each of these locks for weeks, locking our bikes to bike racks, benches, light poles, and hitch bike racks before subjecting them to a series of destructive tests to see for ourselves how easily they could be compromised. No lock is 100% secure given a determined thief, ample time, and the right tools, but we’ve got recommendations based on the security, portability, and ease of use for U-locks, chains, and folding lock options based on the results of our testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we’ve chosen our favorite models across all lock styles and types.

At $180 it is fairly expensive, but it is the most secure lock we tested. It has a good-sized locking area, a reflective finish, a solid key feel with an automatically covered keyhole, and Litelok’s “Twist and Go” frame mount is one of the more stable and easy to use in the test. It also boasts a Diamond-level Sold Secure rating and is rated the “Highest” on Litelok’s own security rating system.</p><p></p><p>One of the main reasons the Litelok X1 is so secure is that the hardened steel core has a layer of Barronium composite fused to it. This material is super robust and “resists angle grinder attacks”, and this proved to be true in our destructive testing. Compromising the Litelok X1 will require thieves to change their grinder wheel at least twice, as getting about ⅔ of the way through the shackle took us 1 minute 38 seconds with a 4.5” metal cut-off wheel that was completely destroyed in the process. And, thanks to the anti-rotation feature, both sides of the U-lock will need to be cut to remove it from a bike. To break this lock, the grinder wheel changes add to the required time significantly and also require preparation and extra tools. It also has the most pungent smell and the coating gets very sticky and gums up the grinder wheel in the cutting process.</p><p></p><p>The Litelok X1 is not only the most secure U-lock, it is also the most well-thought-out. Bright, reflective panels are always appreciated, the frame mount is sturdy and easy to work with, and the key feel is excellent (and protected). The 10.1cm x 19.6cm locking area is about average among the U-locks we tested and easily fits around the frame, wheel, and bike rack or pole that you’re locking onto. While we wish Litelok included a couple more spare keys, and you do need to be careful to attach the crossbar totally perpendicular to the shackle, the X1 is still the best overall U-lock we tested, and significantly more resistant to angle grinder attacks than any other option. Yes, it can be broken, but the extra time and tools required to do so will likely send most bike thieves packing before they do.</p><p></p><p>It’s not cheap, but if you lock your bike regularly, store your bike in an area that requires a high level of security, and need to protect a larger investment, we feel the <a href=\"https://us.litelok.com/products/litelok-x1\">Litelok X1 Armoured Barronium</a> is absolutely worth the asking price.

With its Diamond Sold Secure rating, square profile, large locking area, and $5001 bicycle anti-theft offer (not available in NY or outside the US), the OnGuard Brute provides a high level of security and more flexibility in what you can lock to than other U-locks. </p><p></p><p>The OnGuard Brute is similar in size and function to other U-locks we tested, although its squared-off shackle makes the locking area a bit larger and makes it easier to lock to a wider range of bike racks and fixed objects. Like other U-locks, it’s easy to lock around the frame, a wheel, and a pole, and the added space within the locking area just makes it a little more user-friendly. The hardened steel shackle is coated in non-marking rubber and is tough enough to have earned a Diamond-level rating from Sold Secure and nearly tops OnGuard’s own security rating charts with a 95/100.</p><p></p><p>Breaking into the Brute required two cuts with an angle grinder, each taking 38 seconds – the second longest time for the U-locks we tested. Given the X4P Quattro Bolt Locking Mechanism, the shackle needs to be cut on both sides to be fully compromised. The two cuts wore through about ⅔ of a grinder wheel, significantly more than any other except for the Litelok X1, which is twice the price. The Z-Cylinder key system is also pick-resistant and makes picking the lock an arduous process, even for a skilled thief. </p><p></p><p>The OnGuard Brute comes with an “all-tube mounting bracket” that is designed to work on a variety of frame tube shapes and diameters. We didn’t love the frame mount option as it doesn’t play nice with wide or formed tubes or externally routed cables but had no problems carrying the 8001 Brute STD in a backpack or messenger bag. It also comes with 5 keys, one of which has a micro-LED light, so you should have plenty to go around even if you lose a couple. </p><p></p><p>With its ease of use, comparatively large locking area (for a U-lock), and sub $100 price, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009T4F9G8/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">OnGuard Brute 8001 STD</a> is a great value that should deter most thieves. It also has a $5,001 anti-theft program (registration and participation required, see OnGuard website for terms and conditions) that can add a little extra peace of mind and potential reimbursement in the event of theft.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009T4F9G8/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The OnGuard Brute 8001 STD U-lock locking a bike to a large pole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Brute-8001-STD-in-use-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Not only is the OnGuard Brute a solid value, but its squared-off locking area makes it a bit easier to lock bikes to larger fixtures.

While folding locks are inherently a little less secure than some U-lock and chain locks because they only require one cut to compromise, they are easy to carry on the bike or in a bag, making them more easily portable and convenient. Of course, that’s one of the areas the Foldylock Forever shines, and it also proved to be more robust and secure than the other folding locks we tested. </p><p></p><p>The Foldylock Forever is the top-level folding lock in Seatylock’s range of folding models, and it boasts the highest security rating of 18/18 on their own rating scale. It backs this up with an impressive Gold-level Sold Secure rating, which is very high for a folding model. The rubber-coated hardened steel bars are thick and strong, and they are connected by “ultra-protected rivets” that resist sawing, cutting, and prying attacks. We used several methods to try and break the Foldylock Forever, and it did not succumb to any drill or leverage testing. Like pretty much any lock, however, it can be compromised with an angle grinder, but it did require 40 seconds with the angle grinder to be cut, which is more than 10 seconds longer than the other folding models we tested. </p><p></p><p>The keys have a great feel with smooth operation and well-defined open and closed positions, and although we wish the slot to close the lock rotated fully, the 90 cm locking perimeter length allows you to attach to larger obstacles than most U-locks. Even with the larger locking area, the Foldlylock Forever is still fairly lightweight and folds down quite small and fits nicely into the included frame mount bracket that is super secure and virtually noise-free in transit and it comes with its own mount straps or attaches directly to your bottle cage mounts. </p><p></p><p>While folding locks will always be quicker to cut than U-locks, the Foldylock Forever did take the longest to cut open for the folding locks we tested and has a high-quality build that should last, well, forever, unless someone with an angle grinder comes for your bike. This lock has a premium feel with ultra-smooth key operation, and, at $125, is a great option for riders who do not require the absolute highest level of security.

Though it isn’t the most secure lock we tested, it is a solid medium security option that is lightweight, easily portable, and easy to use. </p><p></p><p>With a 100cm locking perimeter, the rubber-coated hardened steel bars are easy to get around a wide range of features and the ability to fully rotate the lock mechanism makes the Kryptolock 610 S the most user-friendly of all the folding models we tested. And, when it comes to user-friendliness, the frame mount makes it very easy to deal with the lock on the bike and fit into small spaces due to the pivoting entry, while being secure in transit and easy to install. Like other folding models, convenience, ease of use, and portability are some of its best attributes, and where the KryptoLok 610 S really shines.</p><p></p><p>In terms of security, the KryptoLok 610 S provides a moderate level with a rating of 6/10 on Kryptonite’s own rating scale. At the time of publication, this lock has not been rated by Sold Secure, although similar Kryptonite locks have a Bronze rating. In our destructive testing, we were not able to break it with 24″ bolt cutters, though it does seem possible with a longer pair and a bit more leverage. Moving on to the angle grinder, it required only 23 seconds to cut through one of the steel bars and remove it from the bike. This was expected, as we don’t know of a single folding model that is capable of withstanding such an attack.</p><p></p><p>While it can be cut pretty quickly with an angle grinder (like every other folding lock), the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fkryptonite-kryptolok-610-s-key-folding-lock\">Kryptonite KryptoLok 610 S</a> is the most affordable, lightest, and easiest-to-use folding lock we tested.

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090C4XSY/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">OnGuard Mastiff 8019L</a> is a beefy chain lock that’s 180cm long and has a fabric-covered titanium-reinforced hardened steel chain with 10mm gauge links that is secured with a small but beefy U-lock. As the longest chain lock in our test, it tips the scales at a whopping 4,876 grams (10.75 lbs)! While you don’t necessarily want to be carrying it around, the long length makes the Mastiff 8019L a great choice for use with bike racks on cars or locking multiple bikes and the $3001 anti-theft offer adds value to this $130 lock.</p><p></p><p>Like the other OnGuard U-lock we tested, the key operation is smooth and reliable and we appreciate the velcro strips that weaved through the chain links and stopped the fabric cover from creeping along the chain. The 180cm, or 6-foot, long chain offers plenty of length and easily loops through two bike frames and a bike rack, and it is also sold in two shorter, and lighter weight, versions. The fabric covering on the chain helps prevent it from scratching your bike frames, but it is still not recommended to leave it locked to your bikes in transit to avoid any potential abrasion. </p><p></p><p>The ends of the chain are secured with a small but burly U-lock that has a 14mm shackle diameter. Breaking this lock requires the use of an angle grinder, and it took two cuts at 43 seconds each to get through it. The chain itself is a little bit easier to compromise, taking a single 36-second cut to get through both sides of a link. So, while it is possible to break this lock, it does require the use of power tools to do so. It isn’t the most secure chain lock around, but it definitely takes some effort to get through. That said, it has a Gold-level Sold Secure rating and a 90/100 on OnGuard’s own security rating scale. </p><p></p><p>As with the OnGuard Brute U-lock, we appreciate that OnGuard provides five keys, including an LED key, with the 8019L Mastiff. Given its heavy weight and dimensions, however, it is far from the most portable or convenient. But, for anyone looking for a well-considered, reasonably secure (requires power tools), long chain to keep in the car or use at home, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090C4XSY/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">OnGuard Mastiff 8019L</a> is a great choice and a relatively good value, particularly considering the $3001 anti-theft offer from OnGuard.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090C4XSY/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The OnGuard Mastiff 8019L chain lock in use locking two bikes on a hitch bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OnGuard-Mastiff-8019L-in-use-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Burly chain locks like the OnGuard Mastiff 8019L might be cumbersome to carry but they are great for keeping in the car and locking bikes on hitch racks.

The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fkryptonite-new-york-fahgettaboudit-chain-1410-and-ny-disc-lock\">Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain 1410</a> with New York Disc Lock has a 100cm chain length with 14mm gauge 3t Hardened Manganese Steel links secured with the stout but small New York Disc U-lock. All that security comes with a weight penalty, and, at 5,034 grams (11 lbs) it is the heaviest lock in our test, making it relatively inconvenient to transport for long distances by bike. Still, if you need a solid chain lock that will intimidate thieves and take a significant amount of time to cut through, it’s hard to top the Fahgettaboudit Chain 1410.</p><p></p><p>Kryptonite takes bike security seriously and that is evidenced by the Diamond-level Sold Secure rating and Kryptonite’s own 10/10 security rating for the Fahgettaboudit Chain. In addition to looking super secure, the 14mm gauge Manganese Steel links are super hard to cut through, requiring 1 minute and 17 seconds with our angle grinder wheel to cut one clean through. Likewise, the U-lock shackle required two separate cuts taking 48 seconds each to open it up. Opportunistic bike thieves don’t stand a chance, and even skilled thieves will need power tools and little time to compromise this chain lock. </p><p></p><p>The 100cm chain length makes it easy to lock your bike to a bike rack, but it isn’t quite long enough to lock both wheels and the frame or even two bikes together on the same car rack. That’s one of the primary drawbacks of this otherwise super secure model and one of the reasons we don’t choose it as our favorite chain lock. We’d love to see a longer version of the Fahgettaboudit 1410, though it would likely be prohibitively heavy. Fortunately, Kryptonite does make the Fahgettaboudit 1415 and 1515 models in 150cm lengths for anyone seeking a slightly longer option. </p><p></p><p>While it is heavy, difficult to carry, and fairly expensive at $180, the Fahgettaboudit Chain 1410 takes the brute-force approach to locking your bike and earns its Sold Secure Diamond rating. It also comes with a $ 5,000 Anti-Theft Protection Offer (see the Kryptonite website for details) that adds value and peace of mind to help justify the price tag.

That’s where the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F116718%2Fhiplok-gold-maximum-security-wearable-chain-lock\">Hiplok Gold Wearable Chain</a> lock comes in. This is the only lock, chain or otherwise, we tested that is designed to be worn on your body with a unique webbing strap that essentially turns it into a belt for transport. Still, the Hiplok Gold has an 85cm locking length, a 10mm chain link gauge, and a tough lock with a 12mm shackle diameter. Given its portability and lighter weight (less than half the weight of the other chain locks we tested), it still boasts an impressive Sold Secure Gold rating and makes a lot of sense for people seeking a portable chain lock in medium-risk areas. </p><p></p><p>The standout feature of the Hiplok Gold is that it is designed to be worn around the waist. It has a small webbing “belt” that attaches the two ends around the body and can be adjusted to fit 30 to 44” waist sizes. We found it to be reasonably comfortable and convenient to wear while riding short distances, something we can’t say about other chain locks we tested. Though it is much lighter than the other chain locks tested, it still weighs 2,315 grams and may cause some discomfort and possibly even chafing on longer commutes or excursions or if worn under a backpack or messenger bag. And, while it most definitely makes it easy to carry, a minor gripe with the webbing “belt” is that it can get in the way of the padlock when locking up, but this should not be a deal breaker by any means.</p><p></p><p>A lock is only as strong as its weakest link, so we put the Hiplok Gold through our cutting tests to see how it compares to the competition. Hacking at it with bolt cutters barely even left a mark, so we went after one of the 10mm gauge chain links with the angle grinder as the 12mm padlock shackle is larger and difficult to access. With the angle grinder, fully cutting the hardened steel chain took 48 seconds, falling in the middle of the chain locks we tested and showing that it would take a determined and well-prepared thief to get away with your bicycle. </p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a quality chain lock that offers a practical solution to portability, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F116718%2Fhiplok-gold-maximum-security-wearable-chain-lock\">Hiplok Gold Wearable Chain</a> is very worthy of consideration. With a Gold security rating, it can shrug off most attacks short of an angle grinder and provide adequate security for most applications. The Hiplok Gold comes in the standard black color we tested for $130, and it is also offered in “Superbright” with high visibility reflective fabric for $140.  </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F116718%2Fhiplok-gold-maximum-security-wearable-chain-lock\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PDHHLK2/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Hiplok Gold Wearable Chain bike lock around the waist\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hiplok-Gold-Wearable-Chain-in-use-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Hiplok provides a practical solution for transporting a burly chain lock with the Gold Wearable Chain.

Since you don’t always need a high-security lock, small, lightweight models like this are a convenient option to add a little security when theft risk is low. </p><p></p><p>The ABUS Combiflex Travelguard is the lightest weight, most affordable, and lowest security option of the models we tested. It sells for $35 and weighs a scant 80 grams. While it essentially looks like a very large zip tie with a combination lock on the end, it hides a flexible steel core inside. It has a 45cm locking length, and while that is fairly short, it is still easy to loop around a bike frame and fixed object. It also works well for other purposes, like locking your skis for a few minutes while you head into the lodge, or securing your helmet to your bike while you grab a mid-ride espresso.  </p><p></p><p>Rated with a Light/Low-security rating from ABUS, and given the superlight weight and size, it comes as little surprise that the Combiflex Travelguard was quite easy to compromise with hand-held tin snips. While we wouldn’t recommend leaving your bike unattended with only the Combiflex Travelguard, it is a great option for quick stops where you can see your bike in safe areas, and at $35, it can’t hurt to have one or two in your bag. The three-digit combination is smooth and easy to use, and it’s tough enough that it isn’t easily pulled open by hand. </p><p></p><p>Locking up is always safer than no lock at all, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF5DNG3Q/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">ABUS Combiflex Travelguard</a> could discourage opportunistic, grab-and-run type theft if you have an unexpected stop and need to run inside somewhere quickly. If the bike security risk is low, this lock is a convenient, lightweight, easily portable, and user-friendly option.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF5DNG3Q/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F205435%2Fabus-bordo-granit-6500k90-bk-sh-folding-lock\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tABUS Bordo Granit 6500K\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$200</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Folding</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sold Secure rating</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Gold</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Mfg.

This convenient and easily portable folding lock has a 90cm locking length, 8 x 30mm hardened steel bars, and drill-resistant rivets that also earned it a 15/15 security rating on ABUS’s own scale. </p><p></p><p>As with other folding locks, one of the highlights of the Bordo Granit 6500K is its small collapsed size and ease of portability. It folds down small and is easy to carry in a messenger bag or backpack, and even easier to transport on your bike using the included frame mount. At 1767 grams, it isn’t exactly a featherweight, and it was the heaviest folding lock we tested, but it is far from prohibitively heavy either.  </p><p></p><p>The 90cm locking perimeter of the Bordo Grait 6500K is similar to other folding models and adequate for looping through the frame, a wheel, and around a fixed object, while the soft coating on the steel bars prevents any damage to your frame. Compared to other folding locks, the locking mechanism was a little fiddlier in use, but very solid and secure once it was locked. </p><p></p><p>In our cutting tests, we were unable to break the Abus Bordo Granit 6500K with hand tools, including the 24” bolt cutters. Attempting to drill out the rivets or break them with leverage also proved to be futile.

The combination of the U-lock and 4-foot long cable makes it easy to lock multiple bikes or around larger objects, and the weight and size make it reasonable to carry around in a bag when you’re cruising around town. </p><p></p><p>The Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7 with 4’ Flex cable provides a slightly undersized U-lock and a 4-foot long (122 cm) 9.5mm braided and coated steel cable. Though cable locks are not our first choice given the fact they can typically be cut with hand tools, when combined with the U-lock it gives more flexibility for locking up both wheels or multiple bikes is the theft risk isn’t super high. Still, the Evolution Mini-7 U-lock has a Gold-level Sold Secure rating (the cable is not rated), and the package gets a 7/10 on Kryptonite’s security rating scale. </p><p></p><p>The Evolution Mini-7 U-lock that is included in this package is a bit smaller than other U-locks we tested with a locking area of 8.4cm x 17.8cm. This limits its ability to fit around larger posts or fixtures, although most standard bike racks still work just fine. It’s easily able to capture the frame and one of the wheels, though it can be a little tougher to include the locking fixture (rack or post) than U-locks with larger shackles. The cable can then be looped through the other wheel or another bike, with the knowledge that it is the weakest part of the lock system.</p><p></p><p>This lock comes with a frame mount that is attached with a fabric loop around the frame. While this works okay, we found it difficult to ever get it tight enough that it didn’t shift around in use. It also wouldn’t hurt if the mount itself was a little lower profile, as it sticks out a bit and slightly limits the other space within the frame for water bottles and the like. During testing, we usually opted to toss the locking into a bag and carry it that way, which works just fine as well.</p><p></p><p>When put up against our cutting tests, it took nearly 5 minutes to cut the cable with hand-held tin snips and 30 seconds to get through it with our bolt cutters. The U-lock, however, required the use of the angle grinder and two cuts that took 26 seconds each to fully compromise given the <em>Double Deadbolt</em> design that resists twisting of the shackle. While this was the quickest U-lock to cut through with an angle grinder, it still required the use of one to break it, so opportunistic thieves who aren’t carrying power tools will still be out of luck. </p><p></p><p>All that said, at $98, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188310%2Fkryptonite-evolution-mini-u-lock-with-flex-cable\">Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7 with 4’ Flex cable</a> is a good deal for a reliable package for those with medium to low-security needs that will surely deter most opportunistic bike theft. The combination of the U-lock and the cable gives you flexibility in what you’re locking up or locking to, and while the cable can be more easily compromised, it still takes some effort and an angle grinder to get through the U-lock.  </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188310%2Fkryptonite-evolution-mini-u-lock-with-flex-cable\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZT8KZ1/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F115950%2Fabus-granit-x-plus-540-u-lock\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tABUS Granit XPlus 540 + SH B\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$160</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>U-Lock</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sold Secure rating</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Diamond</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Mfg.

At just 1,465 grams, it’s the lightest dedicated U-lock we tested, second only to the much smaller Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7 (that comes with a cable). It comes with a unique, easy-to-use, rotating frame mount, and the relatively large locking area makes locking to most things fairly easy.</p><p></p><p>The ABUS Granit XPlus 540 has a hardened steel shackle with a locking area that measures 10.8cm x 23cm. This gives plenty of space to fit around a frame and wheel, and the pointed end of the shackle gives a little extra length to fit around skinny poles or bike racks. It features ABUS’s XPlus locking cylinder which they say provides the greatest protection against tampering, plus it has an automatic keyhole cover to keep out dirt and/or the elements. </p><p></p><p>The Granit XPlus 540 we tested comes with the SH B mounting bracket that takes a unique approach to loading. It is designed to have the lock inserted horizontally from the side and locked into position by rotating so it sits vertically within the frame. While this is relatively easy to use and works fairly well, the frame mount itself is higher profile and may limit its ability to sit within the front triangles of smaller frames. Such was the case with the bike we used for testing, so we opted to carry it in a bag or backpack which is always an option. </p><p></p><p>Given the Grant XPlus 540’s Diamond Sold Secure rating, we expected it to be a little harder to compromise in our cutting tests. We were not able to do much damage to the hardened steel shackle with bolt cutters, of course, though it succumbed to our angle grinder test in short order with two 27-second cuts. That’s about 13 seconds quicker per cut than the Litelok X1 and its armored Barronium shackle that also managed to damage the cutting wheel more dramatically in the process and required it to be changed to make the 2nd cut. Still, a thief will need to be determined and be carrying power tools to break this lock.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F115950%2Fabus-granit-x-plus-540-u-lock\">ABUS Granit XPlus 540</a> is a solid U-lock that will ward off attacks from hand tools and will keep your bike protected in all but the highest-risk situations.

With a thick layer of padding and robust webbing surrounding a 6mm diameter chain and interwoven 8mm steel cable, this lock is an interesting hybrid. It is relatively light at 1133 grams, easy to feed through tight spots, and the straight-on locking mechanism and automatically closing key position make it one of the most user-friendly in the field. </p><p></p><p>Being that it is extremely easy and comfortable to route through frames, wheels, and anchors, and because the locking mechanism snaps into the locked position automatically when the loose end is put into position, the Goose was one of our favorite locks for quick stops in relatively safe places. When using the lock, it has very little risk of user error, is quick and easy to use, holds its shape, and is comparatively lightweight for a chain lock. </p><p></p><p>While we couldn’t find a perfect way to carry it on the frame or our body – the 85mm length is a little too short to wear around the waist or crossbody over a shoulder – twisting the lock into a figure-eight makes it easy to carry in a bag. Given its soft covering and flexibility, we’d love to see ABUS figure out how to make this design into a wearable option, but it’s relatively easy to transport as long as you have a bag to carry it in.</p><p></p><p>The Goose hasn’t yet been rated by Sold Secure and it gets a 7/15 security rating on ABUS’s own scale. It isn’t the most secure lock we tested, and, like its design, breaking it was unique. We were able to break it using only hand tools, but it required a bit of time and a few different tools to do so. Both the chain and steel cable were cut with 24” bolt cutters, but not until the webbing and padding were cut with scissors, a knife, or a sharp razor blade to get them out of the way. With the padding and webbing intact, there was too much padding to cut through the chain/cable. And, while the chain and cable were easy to cut with the 24” bolt cutters, it did require three separate cuts because they sit so close together it was difficult to break them all simultaneously. </p><p></p><p>If you need a lock for low-medium risk situations, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF5CSJZ7/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">ABUS Goose 6206K</a> is an interesting and unique option to consider. With a light weight, padded chain, and easy-to-use design, it makes locking your bike for quick stops simple and hassle-free.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF5CSJZ7/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike Locks Comparison Chart</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Lock Model</th><th>MSRP</th><th>Type</th><th>Sold Secure Rating</th><th>Mfg.

Some of us have even had expensive bikes stolen and know firsthand the pain, disappointment, and monetary loss that bike theft can cause. We always lock our bikes when they are anywhere other than inside of our homes, and we’re always searching for the best locks to keep our precious rides safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our bike lock buyer’s guide, we called on Bikerumor contributor and review author Paul Clauss to test and compare 12 of the best models on the market side by side. A mechanical engineer by trade, Paul has a keen eye for design and features that enhance ease of use and functionality. He enjoys tinkering with products to tease out their strengths and weaknesses, and he is particularly adept at destroying things when asked. In addition to using each lock as it was intended, Paul ran each through a series of destructive tests to see how they stand up to the most common methods of bike theft. After testing was completed, we narrowed in our favorite models considering factors like portability, ease of use, functionality, and security based on our findings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An avid mountain biker and mountain bike coach, Paul has also applied his passion for testing and analyzing products to several other buyer’s guides. Just this year, he has tested and reviewed <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-dropper-post/\">dropper seatposts</a>, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">best flat pedals</a> on the market, as well as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-flat-pedal-shoes/\">flat pedal shoes</a> to go along with them. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Cutting a bike lock with an angle grinder during bike lock testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>In addition to using each lock to analyze ease of use, portability, and functionality, we subjected each model to a series of cutting tests to see how easy or difficult they are to compromise.

We locked bikes to bike racks, benches, poles, and fences, locking and unlocking them numerous times to get a feel for the locking mechanisms and attachment methods. When applicable, we used the included frame mounts to analyze how well they work, how securely they hold the lock, and how versatile they are in terms of mounting and bike fit. After that, we subjected each model to a series of cutting tests using the most common methods of modern bike thieves to see for ourselves how much effort it takes to compromise them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each lock we tested was subjected to the following abuse, in this order:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Attack with small, hand-held tin snips/shears. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attack with larger, 24” bolt cutters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attack with an angle grinder and metal cut-off wheel. This was done with the lock in use.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Tools used in destructive bike lock testing include tin snips, bolt cutters, and an angle grinder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bike-lock-destructive-testing-tools-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The tools used in our destructive bike lock testing. Hand-held tin snips, 24-inch bolt cutters, and an angle grinder with a metal cutting wheel. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are certainly many other ways to break bike locks, but these are three of the most common methods. While it is possible some of the locks that resisted bolt cutters could be snipped with larger, 36” bolt cutters, 24” is a common size available at most hardware stores for an affordable price. And, for the locks we were able to cut with the bolt cutters, all (including the Kryptonite cables) required quite a bit of effort and were not easily defeated. While an angle grinder is capable of breaking pretty much any lock given enough time, we were pleasantly surprised across the board by the resistance to bolt cutters, especially from the U-locks and folding options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the cutting test, we briefly tried drilling out the rivets on the folding locks but, with basic drill bits rated for metal/wood/plastics and a cordless drill, hardly damaged the pivots whatsoever and couldn’t get a clean hole in any of them. Prying and applying leverage to the folding locks also proved to be futile, with each model holding full body weight while bouncing up and down without bending. While there are likely ways to break folding locks by drilling or by using leverage, it seems it would take significantly longer than the angle grinder, which was relatively quick to cut all the folding locks (and they only require one cut). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Broken locks after destructive tests\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-bike-locks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With enough time, effort, and the right tools, any bike lock can be broken.

With so many options to choose from, finding the right bike lock for your needs, budget, and desired level of security can be a challenging task. We wrote this buying advice article to try and clear up any confusion and help guide you through your bike lock purchase decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Bike Locks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The major categories of bicycle locks on the market are as follows: U-locks (or D-locks), Chains, Folding Locks, and Cable Locks. A description of each type, and their advantages and disadvantages, is included below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Side by side shot of the three U-locks we tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-locks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>U-locks like the OnGuard Brute, ABUS Granit XPlus 540, and Litelok X1, typically offer the highest level of security. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>U-Locks (or D-Locks)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>U-locks are generally regarded as the highest security locks available. Consisting of a high-strength shackle (the “U”) and crossbar (making the “U” into a “D”), U-locks are a relatively compact option that cyclists can loop through the bike frame and a wheel when locking to a bike rack, pole, or similar object, though they can be tricky to use when locking to structures with larger cross sections. U-locks fit tight to the frame when in use, which can make it difficult for thieves to cut them without damaging the frame. Though U-locks can be compromised by a dedicated bike thief with power tools (or possibly large bolt cutters with less secure or smaller U-locks), a high quality, high-security rating U-lock should deter most less committed criminals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While high-security U-locks can be heavy, many U-locks come with a spline on the shackle that mates with an included frame mount to make portability easier for commuter cyclists. Their relatively small footprint usually does not allow you to secure both wheels and the frame, but U-locks are often used with chain and cable locks to increase locking length. Three of the U-locks we tested, the <a href=\"https://us.litelok.com/products/litelok-x1\">Litelok X1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009T4F9G8/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">OnGuard Brute 8001 STD</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F115950%2Fabus-granit-x-plus-540-u-lock\">ABUS Granit XPlus 540</a>, have the highest level Diamond Sold Secure rating.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The OnGuard Mastiff 8019L chain lock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chain-lock-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Chain locks typically consist of a beefy steel chain that locks together at the ends. In this case, the OnGuard Mastiff 8019L uses a small but burly U-lock. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Chain Locks</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Chain locks are exactly what they sound like – a thick, generally hardened steel chain locked end to end. Most of the chain locks we tested use a small U-lock, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fkryptonite-new-york-fahgettaboudit-chain-1410-and-ny-disc-lock\">Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit 1410</a>, though some like the Abus Goose or <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F116718%2Fhiplok-gold-maximum-security-wearable-chain-lock\">HipLok Gold</a>, use alternative, attached connection methods. The chain is only as secure as the locking mechanism, so it is important to consider this when selecting a chain lock. The chains themselves have a wide range of cross-sectional thickness and, because chains can be broken by applying torsional force, it is important to look for chain locks with small gaps. Like U-locks, even the largest and thickest chain locks can be compromised with a cordless angle grinder. Most chain locks come with fabric sheathing to avoid scratching your bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chain locks are also available in a wide range of lengths and link sizes. A long chain, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090C4XSY/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">OnGuard Mastiff 8019L</a>, is great for locking to large obstacles, circling multiple bikes, and using with bike racks on cars. They are also quite heavy and unwieldy, making them a great choice for locking in your garage or keeping in the car, but a poor choice for commuting with the lock.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-scaled.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-locks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Folding locks are convenient and portable thanks to their folding designs, but they are typically a little less secure than many chain or U-locks. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Folding Locks</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Folding locks consist of pivoting bars that lock together at the ends, which can be folded into a compact package when not in use and extended to allow more flexibility than U-locks with respect to what you can lock to. With moderate weights and small collapsed dimensions, folding locks can be mounted to frames or carried in bags fairly easily. While they are easy to transport, the pivoting joints present a weak point in the design, and folding locks are generally considered less secure than many U-locks or chains, but many, like the <a href=\"https://seatylock.com/products/foldylock-forever?rfsn=7538225.a870259&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=7538225.a870259\">Seatylock Foldylock Forever</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F205435%2Fabus-bordo-granit-6500k90-bk-sh-folding-lock\">ABUS Bordo Granit 6500K</a>, do meet the Gold-level Sold Secure standards, making them a good option for commuters in low to medium-risk areas. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A cable lock in use locking a bike to a bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cable-lock-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Cable locks typically provide a longer locking length and flexibility in how you lock your bike, but the cables themselves are more easily compromised than other types of locks. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cable Locks</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cable locks are inexpensive, widely available, lightweight, easy to use and carry, and available in nearly any length. They can be secured with a combination key, padlock, U-lock, or nearly any other locking mechanism you can imagine (or buy at the hardware store). Cable locks are also the least secure lock option, with smaller, flexible cables easily cut with hand tools and larger cables requiring only a larger pair of bolt cutters or less than 15 seconds with a Dremel tool or cordless angle grinder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we don’t recommend relying solely on cables to secure your bike, we do suggest using them in addition to other locks, particularly with U-locks as a secondary means to secure your front wheel. Using a cable lock is not going to deter a thief with any level of commitment, but they are easy to carry and sure beat leaving your bike unlocked for quick stops in relatively safe locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Three folding bike locks with keys\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Keyed-bike-locks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Most of the bike locks we tested use keyed locking mechanisms, but there are loads of combination lock options on the market for those who don’t want to carry or keep track of keys. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Locking Mechanisms</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as there are different styles of locks, there are different locking mechanisms to go along with them. The two most common types of lock mechanisms are key locks and combination locks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Combination Locks</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Combination locks use a numerical, alphabetical, or symbolic key that is arranged in order to open each cylinder of the locking mechanism. While you don’t have to keep track of a key, combination locks could be attempted by anyone who walks by and are generally less secure in their construction than keyed locks. For a lightweight cable lock used in addition to a more secure chain, cable, or folding lock, or a low-security lock used only for quick stops in safe areas, a combination lock might deter uncommitted bike thieves, but we recommend keyed locks for most applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Key Locks</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyed locks require a specific key to open and close the lock. The locks tested came with between 2 – 5 copies of the key and, if you have a small number of spares, label them and store them in a safe location so you don’t have to figure out how to break the locks yourself! The majority of the locks we tested were keyed locks and we appreciated keys with LED flashlights included to make finding the keyhole easy in the dark.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"An assortment of keys that came with the bike locks we tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keys-for-bike-locks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Keys, keys, and more keys. Most of the locks we tested use keys and come with 2-5 heys, some of which feature small LED lights for use in the dark. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Factors To Consider</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering which bike lock is best for you, we recommend considering the level of security, portability/weight, ease of use, and sizing as major variables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Level of Security</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The level of security you should look for in a bike lock depends on where and when you lock up. In general, you should choose the most secure lock that you can afford to purchase and carry around. If you live near a college campus, in a major city, or in any area with high crime or bike theft rates, you should certainly invest in a high-quality U-lock, chain lock, or both. If you are a commuter who consistently carries your lock on your person or mounted to the frame, a folding lock might provide a good security/portability balance. As we found in testing, all of these locks can be compromised given enough time and the right tools, even those with a Diamond-level Sold Secure rating, but 4 minutes with an angle grinder is tougher for thieves to get away with than 10 seconds to snip a small cable lock. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live in a safe, more rural area, we still recommend having a solid chain and U-lock to use for quick stops when the bike is on the car rack. Consider the price of your bike and buy a lock with a comparable level of security – you never know who will be driving through that day and it’s easy to take a bike off a rack, throw it in the back of a truck, and drive away in less than 30 seconds. When considering the level of security provided by a lock, read reviews and use common sense based on the size of the lock and your security needs. While you shouldn’t rely on cables as your primary locking means, it never hurts to have a few in different sizes to complement your main lock.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot.jpeg\"><img width=\"1332\" height=\"888\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot.jpeg\" alt=\"A screenshot from the Sold Secure website\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot.jpeg 1332w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sold-Secure-screenshot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Sold Secure is an organization that tests security products and provides ratings based on their findings. (photo: Screenshot of Sold Secure website)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sold Secure Ratings</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/about-us\">Sold Secure</a> is an organization dedicated to reducing the risk of crime by the assessment of security products. They test a wide variety of security products, from safes to automotive locks to bicycle locks, and rate them on their four-level scale described below:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bronze: Offering theft resistance against a basic tool list (aimed at preventing opportunistic crime)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Silver: Offering theft resistance against an enhanced tool list (aimed at preventing more determined attacks)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gold: Offering theft resistance against a dedicated tool list (aimed at preventing dedicated attacks)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diamond: The highest level of theft resistance including the use of specialist tools (aimed at preventing the most destructive attacks that could include angle grinders)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sold Secure rating for the locks they have approved is included in our comparison table. It is important to note that some insurance companies only cover bike theft if the bike is locked with a Sold Secure rated lock. Most lock manufacturers also have their own security scales for locks in their catalogs, which can give a relative view of the security of the lock within their range. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A folding bike lock mounted to a bike frame for transport\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/folding-lock-portability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>When it comes to portability, folding locks and U-locks are the easiest to deal with, but folding locks, like the ABUS Bordo Granit 6500K, take the cake for their small collapsed size. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Portability/Weight</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Security for your risk level should be your top concern when selecting a bike lock, but you’ll need to balance it against portability/weight if you intend to carry the lock with you. In general, folding locks and U-locks are the most easily portable given their smaller dimensions and lower weights, and most come with a frame mount of some kind so they can be attached to the bike in transit. Even if you don’t attach them to your bike, they are usually fairly easy and convenient to carry in a bag while you ride. Of the two styles, folding locks are the most portable given their ability to fold down to a compact size when not in use. The <a href=\"https://seatylock.com/products/foldylock-forever?rfsn=7538225.a870259&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=7538225.a870259\">Seatylock Foldylock Forever</a>, for example, folds down relatively small and fits nicely into its included frame mount that attaches to bottle cage mounts. Similarly, U-locks, like the <a href=\"https://us.litelok.com/products/litelok-x1\">Litelok X1</a>, often come with a good frame mount, they just take up a little more space within the front triangle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A U-lock mounted to a bike when not in use\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U-lock-portability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>While a bit larger than folding locks when not in use, most U-locks, like the Litelok X1 pictured here, are fairly easy to transport on a frame mount or in a bag.

The longest and second heaviest chain lock in the test, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090C4XSY/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">OnGuard 8019L Mastiff</a>, for example, is a good, secure option to keep in the car for locking to the bike rack, but, at over 10 lbs and nearly 6’ long, is not the best lock to carry on anything but the shortest commutes. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikelock&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F116718%2Fhiplok-gold-maximum-security-wearable-chain-lock\">Hiplok Gold</a> is an exception among the chain locks we tested, as it has a unique design that allows it to be worn as a belt for transport. Some other shorter chain locks can also be slung over the shoulder for short distances, though their weight and sizes can be cumbersome and uncomfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A comparison of the size of chain locks and a U-lock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-lock-size-comparison-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Different types of bike locks come in a range of sizes that dictate how much you’re able to lock with them. U-locks can typically capture the frame, one wheel, and a bike rack, while a longer chain lock can loop through two bikes and a hitch bike rack.

Locks with smaller areas, particularly U-locks, will limit what parts of your bike and what you can lock your bike to, and inflexible designs can make it difficult to route around curves. Folding locks offer a surprisingly large locking area, 90cm to 100cm among the models we tested, and are able to loop through the frame, a wheel, and around a fixed object. Chain and cable locks come in a variety of lengths and are generally very easy to use in a variety of scenarios, but suffer in terms of portability and security (in the case of cable locks).  A long length is great for locking multiple bikes at a time or securing to large features or car racks, but difficulty transporting them makes them better suited to leaving in the car or using around the home. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain 1410 bike lock in use locking a bike to a bike rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kryptonite-chain-lock-in-use-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A quality bike lock will help keep your bikes secure.

Even in areas where the risk of theft is low, bicycles are quick, easy, and quiet to steal away and you never know when you’ll encounter an enterprising thief. Even if you store your bikes outside at your home, they should be securely locked, and any bike left on a car rack should be locked. Think about how quick and easy it is to remove a bike from a rack and throw it in the back of a truck or van.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you lock your bike to something, the lock can only possibly be as secure as what it is locked to. Wooden fences or small trees can easily be broken, and it is preferable to look for purpose built bike racks and tall poles. When locking your bike, you are looking for an immovable anchor point that cannot be broken. Small stop sign poles might look like a good option, but they are easy to remove from the ground or potentially lift a locked bike over, giving thieves the option to take the locked bike and remove the lock at their convenience in a private location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locking your bike in a well traveled area, ideally one you can see from where you will be while the bike is unattended, will help deter theft attempts as well. A thief stealing a bike from a dark, empty alley will have more time and options to break a lock than one on a crowded street.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>What should I do if my bike is stolen?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>First, make sure you can prove ownership of your bike before it is stolen. Keep receipts for your bike and major upgrades, make notes and photograph serial numbers, register your bike with the manufacturer (and city or college campus organization), and take photos of your bike regularly. This evidence will be important when you need to prove ownership of your stolen property when reporting a bike theft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your bike is stolen, first file a police report. While stolen bikes are difficult to recover, it does happen. Next, report the theft to your renters, home, or bike insurance. If your bike was stolen in a secured location (like some parking garages) or your workplace, find out if they have any policies covering stolen property and report the incident to them as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is not guaranteed to work, you may also consider reporting the theft to local bike shops, pawn shops, and local riding groups. I’ve seen stolen bikes returned home through strong riding communities, so make the post on the local riders’ social media pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider technology as well – an Apple Airtag could help you track down your bike anywhere, and there are companies that make mounts to attach Airpods inside seat tubes, head tubes, or bottle cage mounts so they cannot be seen and easily removed. If you use this technique, be sure to work with local police when retrieving the bike for safety.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How do bike thieves bypass locks?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There are many ways bike thieves can break even the most secure locks. Any lock can be picked, but most bike thieves opt for a less subtle, brute force technique. This includes using long poles for leverage, hand tools like tin snips and bolt cutters to cut small to medium locks, and power tools like Dremels and cordless angle grinders to quickly remove high-security locks. Some thieves may be able to pick locks and we are certain from the Lock Picking Lawyers YouTube videos that all the locks can likely be picked by an expert, but brute force attacks are much more common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the locks in this test, we used a progression of small, inexpensive hand tools up to cordless power tools to see how quickly they could be broken. Starting with a small set of hand shears, moving on to a larger set of 24” bolt cutters, then going to an angle grinder with a 4.5” metal cut-off wheel, which was able to get through all the locks. Some locks like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009T4F9G8/brbggearcyclingbikelock-20\">OnGuard Brute 8001 STD</a> and <a href=\"https://us.litelok.com/products/litelok-x1\">Litelok X1 Armoured Barronium</a> wore the cutting wheels out very quickly, the latter taking more than two wheels to make the two cuts required to open the lock.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How does my location relate to the risk of bike theft?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Bike theft occurs everywhere, but there are certainly places where it runs more rampant than others. You can see the signs in high theft areas – bikes missing wheels and seatposts, use of heavy-duty locks, and no expensive bikes to be seen locked up on the streets. This is prevalent in high-risk areas like major metropolitan areas and college campuses. In places such as these, using the strongest and most secure locks available will be the best deterrent short of storing your bike inside if possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While bike theft might be less common in smaller communities and rural areas, there are opportunistic thieves everywhere and security should be the top concern when purchasing a lock. Even in quiet and “safe” mountain towns, bike thefts still occur, albeit at a lower rate. Regardless of your location, securing your bike with a trustworthy lock is the best way to mitigate bike theft. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Yakima StageTwo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Hitch Bike Racks of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"mountain bike helmets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-locks/\">The Best Bike Locks of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Paul Clauss","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e128081b03a774f499a52f08202a6e746c66337f2a37898c60f00bb17662d14c","category":"Cycling"}
