Mongoose decided to capture that feeling (and launch their creative campaign for 2021) with their new video ‘Welcome to Dirtvana’.</p><p>This video was inspired by the freedom, creativity, and pure enjoyment BMX riding encourages. A poetic narrative comically encapsulates the unbeatable feeling of stoke, as Mongoose celebrates their deep BMX history born and bred at the racetracks of Southern California.</p><p>‘Welcome to Dirtvana’ features Mongoose riders Kevin Peraza (who won gold in Men’s BMX Park at the 2021 Summer X-Games), fellow freestyle rider Mykel Larrin, and Payton Ridenour (a young female racer who’s competing at the Tokyo Olympics).</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" data-ezsrc=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/572753087?color=e0cfb1&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" ezoid=\"0.8562287952678684\"></iframe></p><p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/572753087\">Mongoose Presents DIRTVANA</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/mongoosebicycles\">Mongoose Bicycles</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>This film wasn’t made as a launch video for any new bikes or products, but Mongoose did tell us your keen eyes will see some upcoming product within; At the beginning of the video Payton Ridenour is seen aboard the Title Team race bike, and some Title full face helmets can be spotted in the mysterious old man’s tent<strong>. </strong>Last but not least, a reissue of Mongoose’s classic Supergoose appears in the tent scene too – and yes, they will be available to consumers! Both featured bikes and the Title helmets are set for release this fall.</p><p>And I hope all you BMX fans recognised Tim ‘Fuzzy’ Hall’s cameo appearance – A legend since the days when you had to pedal at dirt jump comps!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mongoose.com/pages/dirtvana\"><em>mongoose.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"210d39f972d7b2894c27ef140ea0dda38234458c6f503665752aad8443ff6d5c","category":"Cycling"}
