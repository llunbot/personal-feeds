Hershey Jr., reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Charles T. Munger, who quit a well-established law career to be \nWarren E. Buffett’s partner and maxim-spouting alter-ego as they \ntransformed a foundering New England textile company into the \nspectacularly successful investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, died \non Tuesday in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 99. </p>\n\n<p>His death, at a hospital, was <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov2823.pdf\">announced</a> by Berkshire \nHathaway. He had a home in Los Angeles. </p>\n\n<p>Although overshadowed by Mr. Buffett, who relished the spotlight, \nMr. Munger, a billionaire in his own right — Forbes listed his \nfortune as $2.6 billion this year — had far more influence at \nBerkshire than his title of vice chairman suggested. </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Buffett has described him as the originator of Berkshire \nHathaway’s investing approach. “The blueprint he gave me was \nsimple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at \nwonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair \nprices,” Mr. Buffett once wrote in an annual report. [...]</p>\n\n<p>A $1,000 investment in Berkshire made in 1964 is worth more than \n$10 million today. </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Munger was often viewed as the moral compass of Berkshire \nHathaway, advising Mr. Buffett on personnel issues as well as \ninvestments. His hiring policy: “Trust first, ability second.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A new edition of Munger’s book of aphorisms, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Essential-Charles/dp/1953953239/?tag=df-amzn-20\">Poor Charlie’s Almanack</a></em> — its title an allusion to Munger’s idol, Benjamin Franklin — is due next week.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/28/charlie-munger-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"528309afc54d589a176010cf9603cd65b46e0000145541f0ce2d8374f4b41c69","category":"Tech"}
