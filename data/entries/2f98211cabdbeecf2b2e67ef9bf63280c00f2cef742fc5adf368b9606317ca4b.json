Foremost among these is that the station is aging. Parts of it are now a quarter of a century old. There are cracks on the Russian segment of the space station <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/on-the-space-station-band-aid-fixes-for-systemic-problems/\">that are spreading</a>. Although the station could likely be maintained beyond 2030, it would require increasing amounts of crew time to keep flying the station safely.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033868#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033868&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f98211cabdbeecf2b2e67ef9bf63280c00f2cef742fc5adf368b9606317ca4b","category":"Tech"}
