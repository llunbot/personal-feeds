Apple expects to sell just one headset per day per retail store, and the company has told suppliers that it expects sales of seven to 10 million units during the first year of availability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe expensive price point is due to the high-end hardware that Apple is using, but the company reportedly wants to make a future version more affordable by using less pricey components such as lower-resolution lenses. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat could see Apple offer a two-tiered series of the second-generation device to appeal to a wider customer base, similar to the way it offers both standard and more premium Pro-branded iPhones each year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe company's plans to release a cheaper version were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-cheaper-ar-vr-headset/\">first reported</a> by <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> earlier this year, but the assertion that it will be one of two second-generation models is a more specific claim <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/kuo-ar-vr-headset-2nd-gen-two-models/\"> attributed to Kuo</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/23/cheaper-apple-headset-foxconn-report/\">According to one report</a>, Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn is already developing a cheaper second-generation version of the headset, but it is still believed to be in the early stages. Gurman has said the second-generation headset could arrive in 2024 or 2025, whereas Kuo's sources suggest to him that a 2025 release is more likely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first generation model of Apple's mixed reality headset is expected to be announced during Apple's WWDC opening keynote on Monday, June 5.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/apple-second-gen-headset-low-high-end/\">Apple Reportedly Still Planning High-End and Low-End Versions of Second-Generation Headset in 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-still-planning-high-end-and-low-end-versions-of-second-generation-headset-in-2025.2389664/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"58589f900c05dbf81f4b3af82dc69c46606cfe3ecd693ef2dd692a8f59bd7404","category":"Apple"}
