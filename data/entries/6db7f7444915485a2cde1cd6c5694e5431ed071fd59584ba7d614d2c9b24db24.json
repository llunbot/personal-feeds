Plus, they also got our Editors’ Choice award, marking them for the awesome buds that they are. We found they fit fantastically, they have a good battery life, and they deliver good noise canceling and even an extremely useful transparency mode. Our only quibble is that there’s no wireless charging on the case, but we can very well survive this “ordeal” by sometimes plugging in that USB-C cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Beats Fit Pro give you all the benefits of AirPods Pro with better fit, sound quality, and battery life. The call quality is slightly worse and there’s no wireless charging, but the comfort and fit alone are worth the tradeoff,” we wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, the earbuds feature three listening modes, namely Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and Adaptive EQ. While the first mode will block the world around you, the second will make it possible for you to listen in around you, which is ideal when you’re walking around at night or crossing the street, for instance. The Adaptive EQ mode will use the microphones on the earbuds to react to changes in your environment, modifying the sound output to maintain a good listening experience in all situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SO Don’t miss the chance to save big on the Beats Fit Pro. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C\">Order them for $150 at Amazon</a> before the price goes back up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get some awesome Beats earbuds to exercise with</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6db7f7444915485a2cde1cd6c5694e5431ed071fd59584ba7d614d2c9b24db24","category":"Apple"}
