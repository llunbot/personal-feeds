For enthusiasts of a certain age, the brand is synonymous with rallying and fire-breathing all-wheel drive sedans with extremely short service intervals. To my old driving instructor, Mitsubishi was the Mercedes of Japan. And a Mitsubishi was even the first electric vehicle I reviewed for Ars, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/07/mitsubishis-i-miev-greener-ride-but-not-ready-for-the-daily-commute/\">way back in 2012</a>.</p>\n<p>These days it feels very much like the third brand at the Nissan-Renault alliance. The rallying heyday is long past, and its lineup here in the USA is down to just three SUVs and the sub-$20,000 Mirage, all focused on value for money rather than all-out luxury. Mitsubishi <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/after-12-years-mitsubishi-kills-the-i-miev-electric-car/\">didn't follow up the electric i-MiEV with another battery EV</a>, but it does make a plug-in hybrid powertrain for the Outlander SUV.</p>\n<p>The Outlander is relatively affordable by today's standards, starting at $40,345, and a week with a model year 2024 example found it to be a solid PHEV with a big enough battery to make most of one's daily motoring emission-free.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992961#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992961&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
