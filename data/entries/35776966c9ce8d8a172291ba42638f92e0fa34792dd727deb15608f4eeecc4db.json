The filmmakers behind 28 Years Later apparently received technical assistance directly from Apple. 28 Years Later is the sequel to \"28 Days Later\" (2002) and \"28 Weeks Later\" (2007), which depict the aftermath of a zombie-style pandemic in the United Kingdom. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe original 28 Days Later movie was largely shot in 480p standard definition with a Canon XL-1 – a consumer-grade camcorder that wrote data to MiniDV tapes. This was partly due to the need to film complex scenes depicting an abandoned central London under very limited time constraints, where bulky traditional film cameras would have taken too long to set up. The unique shot-on-digital aesthetic subsequently became an iconic part of the movie, so the use of iPhones to shoot the latest addition to the series seems to pay homage to the original film's use of camcorders. The Oscar-winning cinematographer of the original movie, Anthony Dod Mantle, is also returning alongside Boyle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral smaller-scale movies have already been shot with iPhones, such as Sean Baker's \"Tangerine\" (2015) and Steven Soderbergh's \"Unsane\" (2018), but these films were limited-release, low-budget titles compared to the upcoming Boyle movie. 28 Years Later is expected to be the first of a new trilogy of films scripted by Alex Garland. The breakout star of the original movie, Cillian Murphy, is also expected to return. 28 Years Later is set for release on June 20, 2025.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/21/first-blockbuster-movie-shot-on-iphone/\">'28 Years Later' to Be First Blockbuster Movie Shot on iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/28-years-later-to-be-first-blockbuster-movie-shot-on-iphone.2437425/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35776966c9ce8d8a172291ba42638f92e0fa34792dd727deb15608f4eeecc4db","category":"Apple"}
