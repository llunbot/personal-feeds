The capital would then have more Apple Stores than there are in Tokyo, Japan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Gangnam is Apple's first new retail store to open since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/28/apple-store-american-dream/\">Apple American Dream </a>opened in New Jersey in December. Apple now has a retail team of nearly 800 on the ground in South Korea, according to Patrick Schuerpf, director of Apple's retail business in Asia.  <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/south-korea/\">South Korea</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-k-pop-studio-gangnam-korea/\">Apple Treats K-Pop Fans to Spatial Audio Experience at New Gangnam Store, South Korea</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-treats-k-pop-fans-to-spatial-audio-experience-at-new-gangnam-store-south-korea.2385207/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ddd7883f4c0b7bac7387a3d09636e047a9e2f9c0acb187425a1894000719636b","category":"Apple"}
