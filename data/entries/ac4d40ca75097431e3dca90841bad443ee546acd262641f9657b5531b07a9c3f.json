Employees only have to work at the company for 90 days to be eligible, and if they leave, they do not have to reimburse Amazon for any tuition or fees paid during their time with the company.</p>\n<p>Notably, it’s not a reimbursement program—Amazon is paying tuition and fees up front so employees don’t have to dip into savings to enroll. The company expects to roll out the new benefits in January. In addition to bachelor’s and associate’s degrees and GEDs, the program will cover English as a second language certifications. Amazon also announced skill training and apprenticeship programs for entry-level employees working in AWS and other IT positions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793478#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793478&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ac4d40ca75097431e3dca90841bad443ee546acd262641f9657b5531b07a9c3f","category":"Tech"}
