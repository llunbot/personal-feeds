{"title":"X Corp Has Updated Their Mobile Apps, Finally, But the iOS App Is Still Named ‘Twitter’","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271","date":1690576980000,"content":"\n<p>Any normal company planning a product name change would have everything sorted out with the iOS App Store and Android Play Store ahead of time. Needless to say, X Corp is not a normal company and so of course they didn’t have anything sorted out. Yesterday an update to the Twitter app <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1\">appeared in Google’s Play Store</a>, with a new icon and new app name: “X”.</p>\n\n<p>Today, an update to the Twitter app finally appeared on Apple’s App Store. It has the new icon, but the app’s name is still “Twitter”. The app’s description calls it X, though:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The X app is the trusted digital town square for everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What gives? On <s>Twitter</s> X, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickjsheriff/status/1684935759529480192\">Nick Sheriff points to a rule</a> I heretofore wasn’t aware of. Apple doesn’t allow single-character app names:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On iOS, the situation is distinct as Apple does not permit any app\nto have a single character as their app name.</p>\n\n<p>If they manage to obtain approval, it would mark the first\ninstance since the inception of the iOS App Store that such a\npermission has been granted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So who’s going to budge? Will Apple grant a unique exemption allowing X Corp to have the first and only single-character app name in the entire App Store, or will X name the iOS app something longer (<em>X App</em>? <em>X: Everything</em>? <em>X 69</em>? <em>XXX</em>? <em>𝕏 (💦✊🍆)</em>?)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/x-app-android-ios\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"96b6c2be56900ff73dbbfec826ebbcdac78e66025a5501e470bfe519eb15e5d0","category":"Tech"}
