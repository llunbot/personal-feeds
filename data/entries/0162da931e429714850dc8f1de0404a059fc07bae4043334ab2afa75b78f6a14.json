The 27-inch monitor announced Thursday differs from Acer's previous 3D designs with its desktop size and introduction of Acer's headphones-free spatial audio feature.</p>\n<p>Like other glasses-free products, <a href=\"https://www.acer.com/us-en/monitors/spatiallabs/acer-spatiallabs-view-pro-27\">Acer's SpatialLabs View Pro 27</a> uses a lenticular lens and eye-tracking with an infrared (IR) camera to present a 3D view to users, without the clunky 3D glasses associated with yesterday's abandoned 3D TVs. Acer claims its eye-tracking infrared camera has 1280×480 resolution and runs at 60 frames per second. Eye-tracking purportedly works with indoor lighting as low as 10 lux. Only one person can experience 3D at a time, though.</p>\n<p>Acer hasn't specified how close you have to be to use the monitor's 3D functions yet but says it works with up to 11.8-inch (30cm) movements across the X-axis or up and down the Y-axis, as well as 19.7-106.3 inches (50 to 270cm) across the Z-axis (or up to 59.1 inches/150cm with low lighting).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975688#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975688&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0162da931e429714850dc8f1de0404a059fc07bae4043334ab2afa75b78f6a14","category":"Tech"}
