It has a range of different tools for converting file types, fixing files, compressing files, editing, making GIFs, and more. If you want to do something to a video, there's a good chance this software is capable of the task you want to accomplish.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor videos, there is an option to enhance blurry, noisy, grainy or compressed videos to get a better quality result, with the software able to upscale videos by up to 4x and provide better clarity and detail. A stabilization tool can reduce shake in videos, a noise remover cleans up noise in videos, and there are color correction tools for fixing color issues. If you have footage captured by a fisheye lens, there's an option to fix the distortion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/ai-superresolution-video.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"969\" />\r<br />\nTo fix low frame rates, there's an AI frame interpolation feature that adds in additional frames to make videos smoother, and it can boost videos up to 480 fps for 20x slow motion. For converting video, VideoProc Converter AI uses GPU acceleration for faster video encoding and decoding. Video transcoding and processing can be sped up significantly without impacting the quality of the output.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app supports 320 video codecs and formats, including popular formats like MP4, HEVC, AVI, MOV, and MKV. Video can be imported from DJI cameras, GoPros, and other digital cameras, plus the app supports log videos from pro cameras, 3D video, and VR video. There are tools for changing video format, resolution, and frames per second, with no loss of quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/frame-interpolation-videoproc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2154\" height=\"1425\" />\r<br />\nTo cut down on file size, there is a Compress tool that supports entering a target file size or using a compression ratio slider. There are seven video compression methods so you can find what works best.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/image-super-resolution-videoproc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1517\" height=\"914\" />\r<br />\nVideoProc Converter AI supports video editing, with tools for cutting, trimming, and splitting video. Clips can be merged, cropped, and adjusted with one-click stylized cinematic effects. Audio volume and sync can be adjusted, and you can create slow or fast motion videos with controls to change speed. Watermarks are also an option so you can prevent your content from being stolen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/videoproc-ai-colorize-images.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1644\" height=\"968\" />\r<br />\nThere is a built-in feature for downloading videos from popular social networks like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitch, in addition to thousands of other websites. You can even record video directly with the app using an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or a webcam. When recording, the app supports picture-in-picture, iOS screen recording, and green screen mode, which is useful for filming gameplay videos or tutorials. You can also digitize and back up DVDs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAI image editing is supported too, so you can also tweak your photos. There are options for upscaling and denoising images, repairing, retouching, and enhancing faces, and adding color to black and white images. With batch processing, over 3,000 photos can be edited at once.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/face-restoration-videoproc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2152\" height=\"1429\" />\r<br />\nVideoProc Converter AI works on all Apple silicon Macs.
