Dance, reporting for The New York Times (with informative graphics by Tim Wallace and Zach Levitt) on the Bitcoin mining industry:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is as if another New York City’s worth of residences were now\ndrawing on the nation’s power supply, The Times found.</p>\n\n<p>In some areas, this has led prices to surge. In Texas, where 10 of\nthe 34 mines are connected to the state’s grid, the increased\ndemand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise\nnearly 5 percent, or $1.8 billion per year, according to a\nsimulation performed for The Times by the energy research and\nconsulting firm Wood Mackenzie.</p>\n\n<p>The additional power use across the country also causes as much\ncarbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to\nAmerica’s roads, according to an analysis by WattTime, a nonprofit\ntech company. Many of the Bitcoin operations promote themselves as\nenvironmentally friendly and set up in areas rich with renewable\nenergy, but their power needs are far too great to be satisfied by\nthose sources alone. As a result, they have become a boon for the\nfossil fuel industry: WattTime found that coal and natural gas\nplants kick in to meet 85 percent of the demand these Bitcoin\noperations add to their grids.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The costs of Bitcoin seem clear: higher energy prices and more carbon emissions. Totally unclear: what we should, or even can, do about it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/10/nyt-costs-of-bitcoin\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3a01f9e84b759927181d440af89afb3224f3081d2bc0b03b10de2b81ffaa8cba","category":"Tech"}
