While this may sound similar to using drip wax, 123Bike bike eliminates waste from spillage and packaging. The Lube Cube is a chainlube for cycling’s minimalists, and reminds me of a bar of bath soap you might find in a cheap hotel, except instead of drying out your skin, it keeps your bike’s chain slippery and free of contaminants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 50g SoftBlock fits easily in a jersey pocket or pack. 123BIKES’s high-density lubricants claim to stand up to high-torque/high-power more effectively than standard bike lubricant sprays or liquids. So, whether you are commuting year-round and want to keep your drivetrain happy or need a super compact and spill-proof chainlube for your next ultralight bikepacking journey, 123BIKE could be a great pick. Since it’s not bottled, airport security won’t take issue with it being in luggage. A single 50g block can deliver thousands of miles of lubrication for an average rider, and blocks start at $9.99 (though shipping will add $6).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"900\" height=\"588\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/123Bike1.webp\" alt=\"A block of SimplyFast Bike 123. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/123Bike1.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/123Bike1-297x194.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/123Bike1-120x78.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/123Bike1-768x502.webp 768w\" /><figcaption>Keeping a chain lubricated should be this simple.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Eco-conscious riders will appreciate that 123BIKE is claimed to be the most eco-friendly lube on the market, using only FDA-approved ingredients. There are no chemicals, petroleum, or synthetic paraffins, PTFE (Teflon)/ PFAS, standard or nano particulate pollutants in 123BIKE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, there isn’t a wealth of information about 123BIKE, and frankly, I’m more OK with that in an age when lots of people want to take hours treating their chains in a slow cooker after using several toxic solvents to prep them. We have asked for clarification on a few things, including the melting point, whether it should be applied to a chain with factory coating, or not, and where it stacks up in chain wear and efficiency against the current crop of drip wax options. As someone who likes to spend as little time maintaining my bikes as possible, but also demands tip-top performance, I appreciate SIMPLYFAST’s approach here. 123BIKE will be available in some local bike shops or online at event-gear.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.event-gear.com/simplyfast-s-cube-an-all-new-way-to-lube-your-chain/\"><em>event-gear.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/simplyfast-123bike-lube-cube-claims-to-be-cleanest-easiest-way-to-lubricate-a-chain/\">SIMPLYFAST 123BIKE Lube Cube Claims to be Cleanest &amp; Easiest Way to Lubricate a Chain</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"34e0963bf6e13c2caad100d3a6004e725337dfa6c5e8ecb8aa92bae90b4844bb","category":"Cycling"}
