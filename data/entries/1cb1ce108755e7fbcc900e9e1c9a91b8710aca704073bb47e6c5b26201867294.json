The Times had reportedly been negotiating with OpenAI regarding the potential to license its material, but those talks had not gone smoothly. So, eight months after the company was reportedly considering suing, <a href=\"https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf\">the suit has now been filed</a>.</p>\n<p>The Times is targeting various companies under the OpenAI umbrella, as well as Microsoft, an OpenAI partner that both uses it to power its Copilot service and helped provide the infrastructure for training the GPT Large Language Model. But the suit goes well beyond the use of copyrighted material in training, alleging that OpenAI-powered software will happily circumvent the Times' paywall and ascribe hallucinated misinformation to the Times.</p>\n<h2>Journalism is expensive</h2>\n<p>The suit notes that The Times maintains a large staff that allows it to do things like dedicate reporters to a huge range of beats and engage in important investigative journalism, among other things. Because of those investments, the newspaper is often considered an authoritative source on many matters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992911#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992911&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1cb1ce108755e7fbcc900e9e1c9a91b8710aca704073bb47e6c5b26201867294","category":"Tech"}
