Today, Amazon breaks its recent streaming silence with a few new ways to get more players into Luna for less money.</p>\n<p>The first move involves Amazon's massive Prime service, which is finally becoming an instant, free-with-your-subscription way to stream Luna games. Starting right now, paying Prime members can either load Luna's website or install the Luna app on any compatible device, sync a compatible gamepad, and play the entirety of four very solid video games: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/resident-evil-7-review-a-new-perspective-an-old-house-and-a-return-to-terror/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/metro-exodus-a-good-single-player-game-to-usher-in-the-pc-ray-tracing-era/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Metro Exodus</em></a>, <em>Katamari Damacy Reroll</em>, and <em>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom</em>.</p>\n<p>This access doesn't require signing up for a Luna free trial, and it doesn't pause any of these games after an arbitrary limit of hours or in-game progress. But there is a catch: the Prime access to these four games runs out in seven days, on September 15—at which point anyone who wants to keep playing those four games can formally sign up for the \"Luna+\" tier <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jUwz2r\" target=\"_blank\">for $5.99/month</a> (with a free seven-day trial, if you haven't claimed one of those yet). Before September 15, at least, no formal Luna sign-up is required.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792942#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792942&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c78a9ee363572c91d8c060de8231ebf762eee053b6e6b577e431a1961884faa","category":"Tech"}
