It can also be used with the mini-LED display of the new MacBook Pro models and all of Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs of right now, the Polishing Cloth is available exclusively from the online store, and it is not available in Apple's retail locations or from third-party companies. Apple may potentially start selling the cloth in stores at some point, but for now, those hoping for a cloth will need to wait patiently.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update Oct 21 7:48 a.m.</b>: Shipping estimates have now slipped to 10â€“12 weeks, pushing deliveries into early January.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/polishing-cloth/\">Polishing Cloth</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/apple-polishing-cloth-december-delivery/\">You Probably Won't Be Able to Get Apple's New Polishing Cloth in Time for the Holidays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-probably-wont-be-able-to-get-apples-new-polishing-cloth-in-time-for-the-holidays.2318296/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xbebdCZ4qEY:lpmVMGln1Ys:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xbebdCZ4qEY:lpmVMGln1Ys:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/xbebdCZ4qEY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4753db239d1093b9ef51de6deac96796bf39867a90239c2ce312f6368c7b4a79","category":"Apple"}
