Google “synthwave sunset” and you’ll see where the inspiration came from.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past few years, Durán has been creating custom bikes under the brand name Rizzo. This is one of them, a Columbus steel off-road adventurer designed to tackle intercontinental expeditions, featuring a 1980s-inspired paintjob and outrageous tyre clearance. Like most of his projects, this bike was made to measure from start to finish – every tube, lick of paint and component applied with a specific customer in mind.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lord-cycles\">Meet the maker: Chris Lord of Lord Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alessandro-graser-cybro\">Meet the maker: Alessandro Graser of Cybro</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/richard-lambert-windover\">Meet the maker: Richard Lambert of Windover</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘At the beginning I thought building bikes for myself would be really cool,’ says Durán. ‘You can make the bike exactly the way you want it. But when I delivered my first few bikes and saw how happy they made my customers, my motivations changed.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the bikes, Durán spent his days operating boom mics and mixing audio rather than measuring tubes and filing fillets. As a freelance sound engineer, work could be unpredictable, and he needed something to keep him occupied during the quiet times.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"880\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-02-880x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Rizzo\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-02-880x970.jpg 880w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-02-272x300.jpg 272w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-02-768x847.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-02-750x827.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-02-1140x1257.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rubén Dúran taught himself to build bikes during down time from his work as a sound engineer, so he’s used to things being loud.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘At that time I was working five, maybe seven days a month,’ he says. ‘It was enough to live, but I had a lot of free time. I rode my bike a lot but I decided I needed something else to keep my head and my hands occupied. I was getting heavily into the fixed-gear scene in Madrid and the criteriums and all that stuff, so I thought that learning how to build a bike could be a nice side project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The first three frames I made completely by hand without any machines,’ Durán recalls. ‘Slowly I started learning and buying bits of equipment. I made a few frames for myself and for friends and after two years I started selling them to others.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years into Rizzo, Durán was approached by YouTubers Fred and Pam. They wanted a pair of his-and-hers adventure bikes to use on their travels around the world. First stop: Patagonia.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Rizzo\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘They had a couple of early steel gravel bikes, but the tyre clearance was pretty small. They were looking for something with more of a mountain bike approach – something more extreme to go off the beaten track. So we decided to build two 29er drop-bar adventure bikes using Enve’s Adventure fork. This one is Pam’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Big wheels, small frame</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Initially I suggested 27.5-inch wheels, but they wanted to go big for both of them. It was challenging to incorporate all the rider measurements on such a small frame with the 29-inch wheels and make the bike work properly.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Both Pam and Fred are graphic designers, so looks were a top priority. They did their own designs for the paintwork and Durán worked closely with painter Muse Bikes in Madrid to bring them to life. Fred’s design looked to 1970s West Coast America for inspiration while Pam’s took its cues from the 1980s. Think <em>Tron</em>, synthwave and neon colours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think at the time the paintjob was one of the hardest my painter had done. It was not cheap because it has a lot of colours, and there’s a process for every colour. When you introduce more of them there are more processes, and with every process you have more possibilities for something to go wrong. The risk is higher with very intricate paintwork, and Pam’s bike was painted at least twice. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Rizzo\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/meet-the-maker-rizzo-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The first time something went wrong right at the end and they had to strip it back totally and paint it again from the beginning. For us it’s really important to have a great finish, but also for the paintwork to be incredibly strong.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the frame itself, there are a few details that have been added to dial the fit for Pam. The seatpost, for example, is curved to achieve a setback saddle position while still leaving plenty of room for the rear tyre. For the top tube, Durán has used a piece of seat tube tubing, as the thinner profile lends itself nicely to the small frame size, while the seatstays are raised slightly to reinforce the seat cluster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This was a decision I made to give the frames a bit of a mountain-bike feel. These bikes are going to be under a lot of stress and it’s our way of adding some more strength to the frame.’ If you fancy a Rizzo frame for yourself then your best bet is to drop Durán a line. All of his bikes are made to order, so pricing can vary a lot from one project to the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 144 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rizzo-cycles\">Meet the maker: Rubén Durán of Rizzo Cycles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"906f3a280460f9b717763e80ff89b2db2bf00f9cd3cbff5b2149f2aab21801f1","category":"Cycling"}
