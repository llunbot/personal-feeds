Affected devices include the sixth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, the 10.5-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, and the second-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ipados-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe company has not provided a reason for unsigning the update, but there are a number of reports on the MacRumors forums, Reddit, and elsewhere from users who have experienced issues logging into apps after updating their devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/problems-with-apps-after-update.2457073/?post=33905841#post-33905841\">MacRumors forums member <em>mrsmith1</em></a>:<blockquote>I have an iPad 6th generation. After the latest update 17.7.7 I’ve been having problems with certain, but not all apps. Wikipedia, Duck Duck Go, Letterboxd and others. Every time I open them it’s like the first time and I have to sign up or do a tour of the app. I can’t seem to do anything about it. Any ideas?</blockquote>\r<br />\nFrom <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kl69e3/comment/ms4219m/\">Reddit user <em>National_Case748</em></a>:<blockquote>Since updating my iPad to iPadOS 17.7.7 (build 21H433), all apps (such as YouTube, X, etc.) log me out every time I close them. This issue did not happen before the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nI’ve already tried all of the following:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>Checked that Screen Time and Restrictions are disabled.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Verified that no profiles or MDM configurations are installed.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Made sure Safari cookies and password saving are enabled.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Performed a full Reset All Settings.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Finally, I did a complete factory reset and set up the iPad as new (not from backup).</li></ul>\r<br />\nEven after all this, the problem persists. Every time I open an app, it behaves as if it were freshly installed and asks me to log in again.</blockquote>Apple has presumably prevented users from updating to iPadOS 17.7.7 for the time being to address these issues and will release a new update once they have been fixed.<div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apple-stops-signing-ipados-17-7-7/\">Apple Stops Signing iPadOS 17.7.7 After Reports of App Login Issues</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ipados-17-7-7-after-reports-of-app-login-issues.2457165/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cf4dc86c8072e78507d7728b11d11f741ea46d961764e4476836ffa1a6b664ce","category":"Apple"}
