They just do. But why is the Presta valve (or French or Sclaverland valve) the accepted standard? Most seem to agree that the motivation for the tiny valves was that they allowed for narrower rims. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to make bicycles lighter, the rims were made narrower, which meant that drilling a larger hole for a Schrader valve wasn’t the best option for structural integrity. The Presta valve is also supposed to be easier to inflate to higher pressures, which made it a great option for road tires running 100psi or more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all their supposed benefits though, the Presta valve also has some inherent issues. The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/convertair-turns-fragile-presta-valves-into-easy-to-use-tubeless-friendly-schrader/\" target=\"_blank\">valves can be a bit fragile</a>, but more importantly to a lot of mountain bikers – they don’t play well with tubeless. From clogging, to restricting the amount of airflow for seating tubeless tires, some riders are starting to question the Presta valve’s place in mountain biking. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is the Presta Valve Better? Is Schrader?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jones-Spec.-Schrader-Valve-Stem-vs-presta-core-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jones-Spec.-Schrader-Valve-Stem-vs-presta-core-Large-800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"Jones Spec.

The answer seems fairly obvious. With wide rims, there is plenty of material for drilling a bigger valve hole. And with the new Jones Spec Schrader Valves, you can push a lot of air into the tire to pop the tire in place. The Schrader valves are also supposedly better for running lower tire pressures. The internal spring that keeps the valve closed helps prevent unwanted air loss at low psi. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate the point, Jeff Jones put together this Flow Test video. Unsurprisingly, the valves with a larger inner diameter performed better. Is it enough to justify the entire industry switching from Presta to Schrader? That remains to be seen, but for Jones customers, the choice has already been made. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All Jones Bikes and Wheels are Now Schrader Valve</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jones-Spec.-Schrader-Valve-Stem-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jones-Spec.-Schrader-Valve-Stem-Large-800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"Jones Spec.
