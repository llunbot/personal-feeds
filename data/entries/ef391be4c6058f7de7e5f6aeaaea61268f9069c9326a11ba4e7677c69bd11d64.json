It features a sliding cap at the top that reveals a USB-C port, allowing users to charge and pair via a USB-C cable, with a matte finish and design reminiscent of the second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌. When magnetically attached to the side of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, the new ‌Apple Pencil‌ enters into a sleep state to preserve battery life. Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, said:<blockquote>Apple Pencil has revolutionized note taking, sketching, and illustrating, unleashing endless possibilities for productivity and creativity. Combined with the versatility of iPad, the new Apple Pencil unlocks another great option to experience the magic of digital handwriting, annotation, marking up documents, and more.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌Apple Pencil‌ features low latency and tilt sensitivity like the other ‌Apple Pencil‌ models, but misses out on pressure sensitivity, wireless pairing and charging, double tap to change tools, and free engraving. However, unlike the first-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌, it does support ‌Apple Pencil‌ hover on the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models. It is compatible with all ‌iPad‌ models that feature a USB-C port. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌Apple Pencil‌ is priced at $79 and launches in early November. The first- and second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ models continue to be available for $99 and $129, respectively.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/\">New Apple Pencil Announced With Hidden USB-C Port and More for $79</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencil-announced-with-hidden-usb-c-port-and-more-for-79.2407830/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ef391be4c6058f7de7e5f6aeaaea61268f9069c9326a11ba4e7677c69bd11d64","category":"Apple"}
