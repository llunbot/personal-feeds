The updates hit just one day before Apple is expected to reveal its new iPhone and Apple Watch models and the release dates for iOS 15 and watchOS 8.</p>\n<p>These updates are security-related across the board, and they add no new features or functionality.</p>\n<p>Specifically, two main issues have been addressed across Apple's platforms, one with Core Graphics and the other with WebKit. In both cases, maliciously crafted content (PDFs or web content) could be used in arbitrary code execution. Apple also says these updates fix an issue that allowed attackers to bypass Apple protections intended to stop code execution via Messages.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794142#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794142&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ffc0665c366fd98e7d10227da5e88f106fe53c70683fb33d5ea11063e934e39e","category":"Tech"}
