Now, researchers are revealing that, for years, the mitigations have suffered from a fundamental defect that has made them trivial to bypass.</p>\n<p>“Juice jacking” was coined in a <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/beware-of-juice-jacking/\" target=\"_blank\">2011 article</a> on KrebsOnSecurity detailing an attack demonstrated at a Defcon security conference at the time. Juice jacking works by equipping a charger with hidden hardware that can access files and other internal resources of phones, in much the same way that a computer can when a user connects it to the phone.</p>\n<p>An attacker would then make the chargers available in airports, shopping malls, or other public venues for use by people looking to recharge depleted batteries. While the charger was ostensibly only providing electricity to the phone, it was also secretly downloading files or running malicious code on the device behind the scenes. Starting in 2012, both Apple and Google tried to mitigate the threat by requiring users to click a confirmation button on their phones before a computer—or a computer masquerading as a charger—could access files or execute code on the phone.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ios-and-android-juice-jacking-defenses-have-been-trivial-to-bypass-for-years/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ios-and-android-juice-jacking-defenses-have-been-trivial-to-bypass-for-years/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b3ea699dc5d41cf1c0fec8da3fa8a44222ed3a5b9021fa8e063e27a941be8214","category":"Tech"}
