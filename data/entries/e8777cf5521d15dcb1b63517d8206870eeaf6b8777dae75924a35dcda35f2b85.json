Behind, Susanne Anderson (Team DSM) and Alice Barnes (Canyon-SRAM) sprinted to second and third, respectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faulkner escaped a breakaway of five with just over 20 km to go and continued on the final circuits in Sarpsborg alone. Behind her, Trek-Segafredo took up the chase to reel in those from the early breakaway who remained out front. Faulkner maintained half a minute on the peloton up to the final 7 km when her advantage dipped. In the front of the peloton, Marlen Reusser (Alé BTC Ljubljana) upped the pace and the gap to Faulkner dropped below 10 seconds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon-SRAM and Team DSM were the next teams to pick up the chase as Faulkner’s gap hovered around 15 seconds. Unfortunately, a crash disrupted the chase with just under 2 km to go, but Faulkner already had enough of an advantage to hold on for the win.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/kristen-faulkner-wins-ladies-tour-of-norway-stage-1/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e8777cf5521d15dcb1b63517d8206870eeaf6b8777dae75924a35dcda35f2b85","category":"Cycling"}
