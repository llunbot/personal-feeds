{"title":"Far Cry 6 hands-on preview: Enough issues to make us say, “Ay, Dios mío”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790742","date":1630425634000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>The trailer for <em>Far Cry 6</em> featuring a very familiar voice for modern TV fans. </p></div>\n<p>Roughly six weeks before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/far-cry-6-gameplay-reveal-ride-a-horse-pet-a-dog-set-lots-of-things-on-fire/\"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a>'s upcoming launch on PC and consoles, Ubisoft elected to unlock the entirety of this first-person shooter's opening beats for a press-only, hands-on demo. This kind of access differs from the carefully selected \"slices\" we sometimes play in preview events, as those are meant to show an unfinished game in its best light.</p>\n<p>But after going hands-on with <em>Far Cry 6</em> for nearly four hours, I was reminded why game studios are sometimes cagey about prerelease reveals.</p>\n<p>The demo I played was equal parts massive and unwieldy. I couldn't help but feel like hundreds of Ubisoft staffers' efforts to create a beautiful and convincing pseudo-Cuban adventure wound up squeezed into a single, tiny clown car of a package. The issues didn't end with game-breaking bugs and wonky AI, which may very well be resolved on, erm, October 7. At this point, I'm more concerned about uninspiring new loadout systems, a narrative tone that can't make up its mind, and an absolute yawn of a return to the Ubisoft open-world bloat of old.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790742#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790742&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db7b01be5e20abb4faa6974a18b9750b75712db5d96d57f3cd9c335df4d1ec38","category":"Tech"}
