They're way too heavy to economically provide power to Earth.

Citing Asimov and Clarke, Atwater conjured an image of gleaming solar panels floating above the Earth on a large metal truss, all wired in to hardware that converts the current to a form suitable to beam back down to Earth. Unlimited clean power, delivered around the clock.</p>\n<p>He then explained why the system he is working on will end up looking nothing like that vision, even if it will ultimately accomplish the same thing.</p>\n<h2>A long gestation</h2>\n<p>In August, Caltech announced that a member of its board of trustees had <a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/caltech-announces-breakthrough-100-million-gift-to-fund-space-based-solar-power-project\">given over $100 million</a>Â meant to foster the development of space-based power. The timing was somewhat odd, given that the donor, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren\">Donald Bren</a>, had started the process over a decade ago. At the time, Bren had described his interest in space-based power to the university administration, which began identifying faculty members who had research interests that might be relevant to the project.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788222#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788222&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70e088083ce3eb2c5689f841978cd350544629444a32bb40d77a42a1f76bc4fa","category":"Tech"}
