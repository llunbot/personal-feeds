Less than 45 minutes later, the Falcon 9's upper stage released SPHEREx into a polar orbit at an altitude of roughly 420 miles (675 kilometers). Ground controllers received the first signals from the spacecraft, confirming its health after reaching space.</p>\n<p>As soon as next month, once engineers verify the observatory is ready, SPHEREx will begin a two-year science mission surveying the sky in 102 colors invisible to the human eye. The observatory's infrared detectors will collect data on the chemical composition of asteroids, hazy star-forming clouds, and faraway galaxies.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/no-thats-not-a-cosmic-cone-of-shame-its-nasas-newest-space-telescope/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/no-thats-not-a-cosmic-cone-of-shame-its-nasas-newest-space-telescope/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bd013ac3711484fd25913d40281f7376e7c6433c78a64917ef91efa60c310edf","category":"Tech"}
