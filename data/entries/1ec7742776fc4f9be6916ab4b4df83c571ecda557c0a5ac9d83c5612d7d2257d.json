As expected, it immediately drew yet more controversy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828425\">The study</a>, published in JAMA Pediatrics, is a meta-analysis, a type of study that combines data from many different studies—in this case, mostly low-quality studies—to come up with new results. None of the data included in the analysis is from the US, and the fluoride levels examined are at least double the level recommended for municipal water in the US. In some places in the world, fluoride is naturally present in water, such as parts of China, and can reach concentrations several-fold higher than fluoridated water in the US.</p>\n<p>The authors of the analysis are researchers at the National Toxicology Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. For context, this is the same federal research program that published a dubious analysis in 2016 suggesting that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/study-that-found-cell-phones-cause-cancer-in-rats-is-riddled-with-red-flags/\">cell phones cause cancer in rats</a>. The study underwent a suspicious peer-review process and contained questionable methods and statistics.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/controversial-fluoride-analysis-published-after-years-of-failed-reviews/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/controversial-fluoride-analysis-published-after-years-of-failed-reviews/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1ec7742776fc4f9be6916ab4b4df83c571ecda557c0a5ac9d83c5612d7d2257d","category":"Tech"}
