Last summer after getting a tease on one of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dangerholms-9-19-kg-scott-spark-rc-hypersonic-unveiled/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangerholm’s shiny ultralight creations</a>, Garbaruk officially rolled out their first <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/garbaruk-xc-crankset/\" target=\"_blank\">crankset for XC bikes</a>. Now they are back with an equally aluminum light crankset for road &amp; gravel riders, featuring a much slimmer low-Q construction optimized for 1x dropbar chainlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell.jpg\" alt=\"Garbaruk Gravel &amp; Road Crankset, lightweight strong affordable alloy cranks EU-made, CNC-machined in Poland, clamshell seam\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Garbaruk-Gravel-Road-Crankset_lightweight-strong-affordable-alloy-cranks-made-in-Europe_green-clamshell-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new hollow Garbaruk alloy road &amp; gravel cranks are CNC-machined from 7075-T651 aluminum in two halves, then bonded together for lightweight, stiffness &amp; durability.
