The company has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/\">announced</a> an expansion of its AI search features, powered by Gemini 2.0. Everyone will soon see more AI Overviews at the top of the results page, but Google is also testing a more substantial change in the form of AI Mode. This version of Google won't show you the 10 blue links at allâ€”Gemini completely takes over the results in AI Mode.</p>\n<p>This marks the debut of Gemini 2.0 in Google search. Google announced the first Gemini 2.0 models <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/\">in December 2024</a>, beginning with the streamlined Gemini 2.0 Flash. The heavier versions of Gemini 2.0 are still in testing, but Google says it has tuned AI Overviews with this model to offer help with harder questions in the areas of math, coding, and multimodal queries.</p>\n<p>With this update, you will begin seeing AI Overviews on more results pages, and minors with Google accounts will see AI results for the first time. In fact, even logged out users will see AI Overviews soon. This is a big change, but it's only the start of Google's plans for AI search.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c91f1a0b5f0b92ce981471d9d82a2a1cdf94ee3136e7d06f3fe71e3a5d9e5931","category":"Tech"}
