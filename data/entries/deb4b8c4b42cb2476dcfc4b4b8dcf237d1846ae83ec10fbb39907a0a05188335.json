Notably, TSMC's new plant in Arizona will also join 2nm production efforts. In 2027, facilities in Taiwan will start to shift toward production of 1.4nm chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTSMC's first 1.4nm node is officially called \"A14\" and will follow its \"N2\" 2nm chips. N2 is scheduled for mass production in late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced \"N2P\" node in late 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHistorically, Apple is among the first companies to adopt new, state-of-the-art chip fabrication technologies. For example, it was the first company to utilize TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> node with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, and Apple is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's upcoming nodes. Apple's most advanced chip designs have historically appeared in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> before making their way to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and Mac lineups. With all of the latest information, here's how the ‌iPhone‌'s chip technology is expected to look going forward:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>‌iPhone‌ XR and XS (2018): A12 Bionic (7nm, N7)</li>\r<br />\n<li>‌iPhone‌ 11 lineup (2019): A13 Bionic (7nm, N7P)</li>\r<br />\n<li>‌iPhone‌ 12 lineup (2020): A14 Bionic (5nm, N5)</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> Pro (2021): A15 Bionic (5nm, N5P)</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro (2022): A16 Bionic (4nm, N4P)</li>\r<br />\n<li>‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ (2023): A17 Pro (‌3nm‌, N3B)</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> (2024): \"A18\" (‌3nm‌, N3E)</li>\r<br />\n<li>\"‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro\" (2025): \"A19\" (2nm, N2)</li>\r<br />\n<li>\"‌iPhone‌ 18 Pro\" (2026): \"A20\" (2nm, N2P)</li>\r<br />\n<li>\"‌iPhone‌ 19 Pro\" (2027): \"A21\" (1.4nm, A14)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> series of Apple silicon chips is based on the A14 Bionic and uses TSMC's N5 node, while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> and M3 series use N5P and N3B, respectively. The Apple Watch's S4 and S5 chips use N7, the S6, S7, and S8 chips use N7P, and the latest S9 chip uses N4P.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEach successive TSMC node surpasses its predecessor in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. Late last year, it emerged that TSMC had already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/\">demonstrated prototype 2nm chips to Apple</a> ahead of their expected introduction in 2025.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/next-gen-chip-tech-for-apple-silicon-on-schedule/\">TSMC's Next-Generation Chip Technology for Apple Silicon on Schedule</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tsmcs-next-generation-chip-technology-for-apple-silicon-on-schedule.2423925/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"deb4b8c4b42cb2476dcfc4b4b8dcf237d1846ae83ec10fbb39907a0a05188335","category":"Apple"}
