But she was thrown to the pavement and run over by \nher own car as the man drove away with Isaiah in the back \nseat, authorities said. Shepherd thought she might never see \nher son again. </p>\n\n<p>After Shepherd frantically called 911, investigators contacted \nVolkswagen’s Car-Net service, which can track the location of the \nmanufacturer’s vehicles. They hoped to locate Isaiah. </p>\n\n<p>But a customer service representative said that wouldn’t be \npossible because Shepherd’s subscription to the satellite service \nhad expired, according to a new lawsuit. The employee said he \ncouldn’t help until a $150 payment was made, the complaint said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This perfectly illustrates the perils of Apple <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/29/apple-extends-emergency-sos\">eventually charging for Emergency SOS satellite service</a>. If Apple someday cuts off free service for compatible iPhones, eventually there’s going to be someone who dies because they chose not to pay to continue service. No one wants that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/29/volkswagen-gps\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"845b206e3f0391231ac4a95b0a7321db46f921a7d4064c60497455b91d12c710","category":"Tech"}
