He was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison on each charge, with the two sentences to be served concurrently, according to an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.223153/gov.uscourts.mad.223153.23.0.pdf\">order</a> issued in US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He was also fined $15,000 and sentenced to supervised release of three years after he gets out of prison.</p>\n<p>The Department of Justice alleged that in 2019, Cooke helped plan and attempt to cover up the stalking of Ina and David Steiner of Natick, Massachusetts, who run the news website <a href=\"https://www.ecommercebytes.com/\">EcommerceBytes</a>.
