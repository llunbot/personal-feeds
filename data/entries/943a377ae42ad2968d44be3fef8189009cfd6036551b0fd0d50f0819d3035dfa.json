They’re all over the Android phone market and they’re good products–if you don’t mind the crease that appears down the middle of the screen where the display folds. We hear about reports and patents of possible foldable Apple devices, but they haven’t been as substantial as reports from analyst MIng-Chi Kuo, who reported a few months ago that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2258965/apple-foldable-macbook.html\">Apple is developing an all-screen, foldable MacBook</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, Kuo <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1826460677604786478\" target=\"_blank\">posted on X</a> an update, stating that the foldable MacBook’s “mass production delayed significantly.” Apparently, “technical challenges” have caused Apple to push the project out a year or two from the original 2026 timeline. Apple has also settled on an 18.8-inch design, scrapping the larger 20.25-inch device.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Foldable MacBook survey update – mass production delayed significantly<br />1.

Kuo thinks that a foldable MacBook would make a foldable iPad redundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of a foldable MacBook is intriguing. Such a device would not have a hardware keyboard, instead relying on a software keyboard that appears on-screen (think of a super-sized iPhone software keyboard), and it would in turn require a touchscreen UI to make up for the lack of a trackpad. Essentially, it would be a large, foldable iPad, but running macOS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo relies on supply-chain data to form his conclusions; he doesn’t have information about Apple’s software development. So one idea that can be drawn from Kuo’s foldable MacBook reports is that Apple is working on a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674551/touchscreen-mac.html\">version of macOS with touchscreen UI elements.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of macOS with a touch UI has been bandied about for some time, and Apple was even granted a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2323332/touchscreen-mac-tablet-accessory-patent-apple.html\">patent</a> earlier this year for a tablet-like device that runs an OS that looks a lot like macOS. But Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on such a thing. If you put two and two together, though, it seems like they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we do know (or, at least, we’re pretty sure we know) is that Apple plans to release M4-based, not-all-screen-but-still-foldable MacBook Pros this fall.
