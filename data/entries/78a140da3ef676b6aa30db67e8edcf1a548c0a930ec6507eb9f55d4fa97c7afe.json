But now gravel, cyclocross, and even cross-country mountain bike racers can opt for a new lighter Argo X1 with carbon rails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built for fast-paced off-road riding, the Fizik Argo X rounds off all the corners of its road sibling, keeping the gently curved top that is comfortable as you move around on the bike. Then, it adds a shade thicker foam, a flatter nose to perch on for steep climbs, and a reshaped ergonomic cutout for improved comfort over bumpy terrain. so your crotch doesn’t get caked in mud. Plus, that cutout gets a rubber mud flap so your crotch doesn’t get caked in grime.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Vento Argo X1 off-road gravel racing saddle Review, new carbon rails upgrade, underside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_fiber-reinforced-nylon-shell-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can get it with chromoly, titanium, or… carbon rails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_cargo-ebiking-to-go-gravel-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Vento Argo X1 off-road gravel racing saddle Review, new carbon rails upgrade, riding to gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_cargo-ebiking-to-go-gravel-riding.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_cargo-ebiking-to-go-gravel-riding-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_cargo-ebiking-to-go-gravel-riding-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_cargo-ebiking-to-go-gravel-riding-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_cargo-ebiking-to-go-gravel-riding-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_cargo-ebiking-to-go-gravel-riding-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it was only officially introduced last November, I’ve actually been riding the revamped Argo X since last summer on the latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-canyon-grail-carbon-gravel-race-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Grail CF SLX,</a> with ti rails.

And that’s a good thing. The saddle has firm but supportive padding. Its fiber-reinforced shell is plenty stiff. But then, there’s still a bit of compliant flex in its wings, to not feel unyielding when pedaling. And the large central cutout prevents any undue pressure. While the small mud flap then keeps road &amp; trail spray off my butt, with a tiny vent slit that lets a little airflow through and allows rainwater to drain out on those wettest rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Vento Argo X1 off-road gravel racing saddle Review, new carbon rail version 140mm wide 195g actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Vento-Argo-X1-off-road-gravel-racing-saddle-Review_new-carbon-rails-upgrade_140mm-wide-195g-actual-weight-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The X1 &amp; X3 share identical construction, but for the material of the rails.
