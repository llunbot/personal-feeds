The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NHR4NX7?th=1\">Eufy P2 Pro scale</a> syncs with Apple Health on your iPhone and is available for $40 at Amazon right now, $40 off its MSRP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The P2 Pro scale isn’t just smart, but also beautiful, featuring a sleek design in a deep gorgeous shade of dark blue. You may even leave this one in plain sight, instead of shoving it under the bathroom sink. Other than it’s good looks, this scale takes things a lot farther than a regular model, monitoring 16 body measurements, including weight (obviously), body fat, BMI, muscle mass, bone mass, and even your heart rate. The accompanying map creates a 3D model of your body, matching your proportions and measurements given whatever measurements you input. As your fitness journey progresses, you’ll get detailed visuals of the changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eufy P2 Pro scale connects to the EufyLife app which then syncs with Apple Health, alongside Google Fit or Fitbit, making for a versatile addition to your home. so <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NHR4NX7?th=1\">go grab one while it’s at its cheapest price</a> before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get this smart scale at half-price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NHR4NX7?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6f3cd6ca658053bb96c9eb7128ac7e2c6c60630a61dfbddc846231b7881d765b","category":"Apple"}
