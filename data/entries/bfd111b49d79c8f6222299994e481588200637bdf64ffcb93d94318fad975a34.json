The malware-scanning service is built into every Android device and is supposed to flag malware that users have installed. Recently it flagged some popular apps that are very much not malware: Samsung Wallet and Samsung Messages.</p>\n<p>As spotted by <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/10/23/samsung-messages-wallet-harmful-app-google/\">9to5Google</a>, Samsung users have been getting hit with Play Protect warnings since earlier this month. Users on the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/android/thread/238882376?hl=en&amp;msgid=238914336\">Google Support forum</a> have posted screenshots of Play Protect flagging the Samsung system apps, and even Samsung <a href=\"https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EC%86%90%EC%89%AC%EC%9A%B4-%ED%95%B4%EA%B2%B0-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EC%82%BC%EC%84%B1-%EB%A9%94%EC%8B%9C%EC%A7%80-%EC%95%B1%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9C%A0%ED%95%B4%ED%95%9C-%EC%95%B1%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C-%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C%EB%90%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4-%EA%B8%B0%EA%B8%B0-%EB%B3%B4%EC%95%88%EC%97%90-%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C%EA%B0%80-%EC%9E%88%EC%9D%8C-%ED%8C%9D%EC%97%85/ba-p/23913065\">responded</a> to the issue, explaining (in Korean) how to fix any damage caused by the bug. Samsung says (through translation) the issue was caused by \"a temporary failure of the Google server\" and should now be fixed.</p>\n<p>Samsung Wallet and Samsung Messages both come bundled with most Samsung phones as system apps, so they have a wide install base. When Play Protect flags an app as harmful, it pops up a message suggesting users remove the app, but since these are both system apps, users can only disable them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978189#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978189&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bfd111b49d79c8f6222299994e481588200637bdf64ffcb93d94318fad975a34","category":"Tech"}
