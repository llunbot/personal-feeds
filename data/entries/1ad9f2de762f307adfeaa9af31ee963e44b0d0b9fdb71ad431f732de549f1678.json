The cheapest version called the Scalpel HT Carbon 4 that retails for £2,600 / $2,200 / €2,499, is decked out in Shimano <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-deore-m6100-groupset-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Deore M6100</a>.</p>\n<h2>2022 Cannondale Scalpel HT frame details and specifications</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Hi-MOD version of the frame is claimed to weigh 895g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2022 Scalpel HT has been built to be lightweight, and Cannondale claims the frame weighs less than 1kg, at 895g. This claimed figure is for the medium-sized Hi-MOD version, painted in the lightest black colour, without axle, seat clamp, headset, etc.</p>\n<p>The lack of heft is impressive and should appeal to the bike’s target audience; those looking to get to the top of the race podium or blast (repeatedly) uphill.</p>\n<p>In a unique move, the internally-routed gear cables can be modified to use a full-length outer cable, the system usually seen on internally-routed bikes, or changed to use interrupted cables in a bid to further save weight.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The frame has internally-routed cables.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<p>Swapping from a full-length outer to an interrupted one would only save a minimal amount of weight, but at the sharp end of XC racing incremental gains add up. This feature could be appealing to those looking to take weight saving to the extreme, and who aren’t concerned about needing to regularly change gear cables.</p>\n<p>Although the press material doesn’t mention Cannondale’s SAVE Micro-suspension seen on the old Scalpel by name, the new model does have “sculpted flex zones” in the chainstays, that are matched with dropped seatstays to provide rear-end compliance over chattery terrain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear end has built-in flex areas to improve comfort and compliance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<p>I tested the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/cannondale-trail-se-4-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale Trail SE 4</a>, which has dropped seatstays similar to the new Scalpel HT, and noticed just how smooth it felt out on the trails. Hopefully, the Scalpel has inherited some of that model’s inherent calmness.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the Hi-MOD and standard carbon frames share the same PF30-83 press fit bottom bracket and tapered head tube. They’re both fitted with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM’s UDH</a>, and use a 55mm chainline.</p>\n<p>The frame is also stealth dropper-post compatible, with cable routing options, however none of the stock models are fitted with a dropper post from the factory.</p>\n<h2>2022 Cannondale Scalpel HT wheel sensor</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The wheel sensor is made in collaboration with Garmin.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/en-gb/gear/equipment/connected-products/connected-products-sensors/cannondale-wheel-sensor\" target=\"_blank\">front wheel is fitted with a sensor</a> that connects to Cannondale’s smartphone app to provide information such as current speed, route and ride distance information, plus it registers your bike and reminds you when it needs servicing, among other features.</p>\n<p>Although the sensor’s exact specifications aren’t listed, it is co-branded and has been co-developed with Garmin.</p>\n<p>The sensor is fitted to the entire range of Scalpel HT bikes, from the most affordable to the dearest.</p>\n<h2>2022 Cannondale Scalpel HT geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is a lightweight XC hardtail with a modern take on geometry.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<p>The four-size range of Scalpels (from small to extra-large) all feature geometry that wouldn’t have looked out of place on a more hardcore, trail-focused hardtail only a few years ago.</p>\n<p>However, only the most costly Hi-MOD 1 bike comes fitted from the factory with the 110mm travel fork. The extra travel jacks up the front end and pushes XC hardtail geometry forwards with a 66.5-degree head-tube angle.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><caption>2022 Cannondale Scalpel HT 100 geometry chart</caption>\n                <colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Size</th><th>Small</th><th>Medium</th><th>Large</th><th>Extra-large</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seat tube length (mm)</td><td>390</td><td>440</td><td>480</td><td>530</td>        </tr><tr><td>Top tube length (mm)</td><td>571</td><td>594</td><td>617</td><td>640</td>        </tr><tr><td>Headangle (degrees)</td><td>67</td><td>67</td><td>67</td><td>67</td>        </tr><tr><td>Effective seat tube angle (degrees)</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>75</td>        </tr><tr><td>Standover (mm)</td><td>748</td><td>785</td><td>814</td><td>850</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>1124</td><td>1154</td><td>1183</td><td>1214</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay length (mm)</td><td>430</td><td>435</td><td>440</td><td>445</td>        </tr><tr><td>Bottom bracket height (mm)</td><td>315</td><td>315</td><td>315</td><td>315</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack height (mm)</td><td>602</td><td>612</td><td>623</td><td>635</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (mm)</td><td>410</td><td>430</td><td>450</td><td>470</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>Elsewhere on the 110 bike are reach figures that range from 404mm to 465mm, and are slightly shorter than the 100mm travel bike thanks to the longer-travel fork.
