There has been plenty of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic</a> action so far, with the road race events culminating in victories for Remco Evenepoel (Belgium) and Kristen Faulkner (United States), and the track cycling still to come. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) won the Czech Tour ahead of teammate Diego Ulissi, and the Arctic Race of Norway is ongoing, with Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X Mobility) leading the race after his opening day sprint victory. The Vuelta a Burgos also began today. Pavel Bittner (dsm-firmenich PostNL) won Stage 1 ahead of Giacomo Nizzolo (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Double gold for Remco Evenepoel</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-647x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-104366-scaled.jpg 1707w\" /><figcaption>Zac Williams/ZW Photography</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It has been a remarkable few weeks for Belgium’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a>. After a stage win, white jersey and podium finish at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>, he steered a course to the capital for immediate action in the Olympics time-trial, which he won on the wet Parisian streets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past weekend he added road race gold to his glittering <em>palmarès</em>. After bridging to the front group in the final 40km, Evenepoel began to drop his rivals, with only Frenchman Valentin Madouas able to hold his wheel in the last 15km. It was on the penultimate climb that Evenepoel managed to shrug him off and went solo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24-year-old avoided a late scare in the closing kilometres – a puncture necessitating a bike change left him screaming for the team car – and he was understandably stressed, asking the camera motorbike for the timings with no race radios to relay the information. He soon got the news that the second rider on the road, Madouas, was a full minute behind, giving him enough time for it sink in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, Evenepoel climbed off his bike at the finish line and mimed slamming the phone down to celebrate. With this win he became the first male rider in history to win a gold medal in both the time-trial and road race in the same year.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/evita-muzic-interview\">Évita Muzic interview: ‘If I had to choose between the Olympics or the Tour de France, it would be the Tour de France’</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/olympics-add-cycling-events\">The Olympics needs to add these five cycling events</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-tom-pidcock\">Show of relentlessness wins Olympic gold for Tom Pidcock  </a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Kristen Faulkner flies to road race victory</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/ZW-209516-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Zac Williams/ZW Photography</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The eagle has landed. The United States’ Kristen Faulkner soloed to a sensational victory in the women’s road race at the Olympics. 31-year-old Faulkner, who only started cycling in 2017, distanced big hitters Marianne Vos (Netherlands), Lotte Kopecky (Belgium) and Blanka Vas (Hungary) in the last 3km of the 158km race. Vos went on to win silver with Kopecky taking home bronze in a close sprint for the remaining medals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faulkner is the first American woman to win the event since Connie Carpenter-Phinney, who rode to victory 40 years ago when the race made its Olympic debut. What’s more remarkable is that Faulkner wasn’t even meant to be on start line. A spot opened up when fellow American Taylor Knibb, who came 19th in the time-trial, withdrew from the road race to focus on the triathlon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wout van Aert for Vuelta debut</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/file-55.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> (Visma-Lease a Bike) will make his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> debut this year, he revealed on the <em>Paris By Night</em> Olympics TV programme.
