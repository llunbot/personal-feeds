That's because I still remember the Dell XPS's infamous up-the-nose webcam, an unfortunately placed shooter that provided an in-nostril view of countless XPS users for years. But Dell wants there to be a different, more positive reason you associate it with funky webcams, and, ironically, the company is all about getting webcams in the most ideal spot possible.</p>\n<p>Dell demoed Concept Pari to the press last week (at the same event where it showed off its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/dells-concept-luna-pc-disassembles-easily-so-you-can-reuse-its-parts/\">Concept Luna repairable PC</a>). It's a 1080p webcam prototype that can depart its holster with a simple pluck, to be placed anywhere magnets work. The idea is that the camera will continue to send video to a connected PC through Wi-Fi, even from a couple of feet away. The most obvious use case for Concept Pari is sticking it in directly on your computer's display rather than on its bezel. This makes for a more personal-feeling conversation with your long-distance interlocutors by bringing their view of you to eye level. </p><div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/listing-4.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/listing-4-640x480.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/listing-4.jpg\">The webcam is placed closer to eye level to make the call feel more like real life.</a> (credit: Scharon Harding)</p></div>\n<p>\"It can be placed directly—anywhere—on compatible displays, in a charging dock, on a stand, or even held in the hand,\" Dell Technologies' CTO of the Client Solutions Group, Glen Robson, explained in a blog post today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820776#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820776&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aee899313438e6afe6f1f967af8c2aa3b8706a9c7066dad0d317321d7c07c790","category":"Tech"}
