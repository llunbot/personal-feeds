The EC specified which companies must comply with the rules for the first time, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2413\">announcing today</a> that it \"adopted the first designation decisions under the Digital Services Act.\"</p>\n<p>Five of the 19 platforms are run by Google, specifically YouTube, Google Search, the Google Play app and digital media store, Google Maps, and Google Shopping. Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram are on the list, as are Amazon's online store, Apple's App Store, Microsoft's Bing search engine, TikTok, Twitter, and Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>These platforms were designated because they each reported having over 45 million active users in the EU as of February 17. The other listed platforms are Alibaba AliExpress, Booking.com, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, and German online retailer Zalando.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934219#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934219&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f834d726b16c67717763511d201d541cdf0999e587be40afcbf03bb9e90369cb","category":"Tech"}
