Pair 155mm of rear wheel travel to 160mm up front with enduro-inspired geometry. Then, power it with a light, smooth &amp; customizable 50Nm TQ HPR50 motor with a 360Wh battery inside and an optional 60Wh range extender. What you get is an incredibly lightweight eMTB that you can ride like a regular bike, but can boost up the climbs to crank out lap-after-lap on your favorite technical trails…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Scott Voltage eRide lightweight TQ-powered eMTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Scott Voltage eRide lightweight TQ-powered carbon eMTB all-mountain ebike, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_complete-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Scott Voltage eRide is the answer to anyone who looked at the incredibly light <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-2023-scott-lumen-eride-emtb-reimagines-trail-ebike-at-15-5kg-first-rides/\" target=\"_blank\">Lumen</a>, wondering if Scott could take it up just a notch. I was one of those people – thinking that the excellent natural ride feel of the 130mm ebike would be awesome with a bit more travel and geometry geared towards shredding downhills too.

So there was never any question that they would adapt the success of their light trail eMTB to a more capable light all-mountain eMTB too. Btw, Scott is still onboard with full-power, long-range, bigger battery eMTBs, and have more of those in the development pipeline. But lightweight ebike fans have been begging for a more capable light eMTB.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Scott Voltage eRide lightweight TQ-powered carbon eMTB all-mountain ebike, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_three-quarters-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What you get is an ebike that looks almost exactly like the latest Scott MTBs, with big downtubes, and oversized seattube-to-bottom bracket junctions to fit the hidden Bold-style rear shock inside.

But it wasn’t nearly burly enough for the kind of riding I would want to do with an eMTB. But on the other hand, heavyweight eMTBs kinda bug me, since I would want one more for shorter rides when you are trying to squeeze in some quick trail laps. And I just don’t appreciate having to manhandle all the extra weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Scott Voltage eRide lightweight TQ-powered carbon eMTB all-mountain ebike, photo by Daniel Geiger, climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Voltage-eRide-lightweight-TQ-powered-carbon-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-rock-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What I did on the new Voltage… was simply squeeze in more rides. When I only had a half hour more free to ride, I could smash it up a fireroad climb and get one more run in before I had to stop. And with the range extender, it was easy to decide to head out for another lap, even when I wasn’t sure if I had quite enough juice remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott-Sports.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-voltage-eride-stretches-out-155mm-lightweight-tq-powered-all-mountain-ebike/\">Scott Voltage eRide Stretches Out 155mm Lightweight TQ-powered All-Mountain eBike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"20602bbc4cbc05464cf841362bad867198c05515acb0eb94ab3d26fec70836ad","category":"Cycling"}
