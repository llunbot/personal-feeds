Campagnolo claims weights per pair from 1,285g for the disc brake-only wheels, a reduction of 100g from the previous generation and only slightly more than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-hyperon-ultra\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperon Ultra </a>climber’s wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also says that the new, 23mm wide rim profile is optimised for 28mm tyres and results in up to 80% reduction in drag in a 15° crosswind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo Bora Ultra WTO wheelset retail prices start at £3,290 / $4,090 / €3,690, while Bora WTO wheels are priced from £2,290 / $2,790 / €2,590. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

Campagnolo first launched the Bora wheelset and the new Bora Ultra WTO and Bora WTO wheels have the same distinctive G3 clustered spoke pattern with 2:1 spoking in the front and rear wheels as their predecessors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is claimed to result in a very stiff wheel with a more even balance in spoke tension and to increase the efficiency of power transfer. It’s also said to reduce transmission of road vibrations and reduce the wheel weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an internal rim width increase from 19mm to 23mm. Although a few years ago, 19mm would have been progressive it now feels quite retro, with almost all newer rims well into the 20s to support the 28mm-plus tyres typical on modern road and gravel bikes. We marked the previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto\" target=\"_blank\">Bora Ultra wheels</a> down on this when we tested them in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo says that the wider rim helps to support<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\" target=\"_blank\"> wider tyres </a>better, providing a larger contact area which aids ‘trajectory control’ as well as aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved aerodynamics </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Bora Ultra\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-8-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the aero front, Campag claims that the new rim profile decreases drag in a headwind by 13% from the previous model Bora wheels and as much as 80% in a 15° crosswind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo has revamped its carbon layup in the rim to reduce weight, with the carbon fibres arranged around the spoke holes to add extra strength, rather than the latter being punched through the fibres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rim bed of the Bora Ultra wheels uses Campagnolo’s Aero Mo-Mag design, with concealed nipples housed in fibreglass-reinforced seats within the rim, which it says improves aerodynamics. The standard Boras have external nipples.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Bora Ultra\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-7-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Bora Ultra and Bora have a sealed rim that doesn’t need to be taped and uses the brand’s long-established 2-Way Fit system which pre-dates the widespread adoption of tubeless tyres and allows either tubed or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless </a>running. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo says that there’s a 135g drop in rim weight as a result of the HULC (hand-made ultra-light carbon) construction of the Bora Ultra. This lowers resin content, resulting in a headline weight for the 35mm depth wheelset of 1,285g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the previous generation Bora wheelsets were available in both rim brake and disc brake format, Campagnolo has continued its march towards a disc brake-only future with the new wheels, mirroring its decision to only offer disc brakes with its latest top tier <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record Wireless</a> groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bora Ultra WTO wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Bora Ultra\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Campagnolo-Bora-Ultra-4-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagolo throws all its best wheel tech at the Bora Ultra WTO wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They use seven spoke clusters and include top spec CULT ceramic bearings in the hubs.
