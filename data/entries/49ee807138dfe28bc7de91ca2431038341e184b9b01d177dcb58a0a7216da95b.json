This decade has seen monumental growth in women’s cycling. Crucially, we now have a proper Women’s WorldTour in which <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">three Grand Tours</a> are held each year for women. In terms of racing, Dutch dominance has persisted in the Grand Tours, new Classics stars have emerged and a fresh crop of youngsters have broken through through the ranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">Conti</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-fa\" target=\"_blank\">nuing our mid-decade ranking series</a>, we’ve dug deep through the results archives over the past five seasons to deduce who we think are the top 50 riders of the 2020s so far in women’s cycling. The list will factor in victories, notable finishes and UCI rankings since 2020. Retired riders will be factors in, as will young riders who weren’t even riding on the professional level back in 2020. For context, only results in road cycling will be accounted for in this list – results on gravel, track or cyclocross will not affect the ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a deep breath and get a coffee, we have 50 riders to get through. Let’s get started.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>50.

The Canyon-SRAM rider’s breakout season saw her claim an impressive stage win atop Blockhaus at the Giro d’Italia Women as well as a gruelling stage of the Tour de Suisse. Those wins were backed up by strong GC results throughout the year. She landed podium finishes at the Tour de Suisse, UAE Tour, Tour Down Under and the Giro. She missed the mark at the Tour, but her GC promise is certainly there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aged just 22, Bradbury will surely fly up the ranks during the second half of the 2020s.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best pro cycling jerseys of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best women’s one-day races of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-mens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s one-day races of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best women’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>49.

Her strong TT pedigree has also landed her on the podium of flatter stage races such as the Simac, Baloise and Bretagne Ladies Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her consistency is evident on the UCI rankings on which she has finished inside the top 70 on four occasions since the turn of the decade, peaking with  a top 30 finish in 2022 during her final season at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Trek-Segafredo</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After leaving the team, Cordon-Ragot was a victim of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">the ill-fated Paris Cycling Club project</a>, which folded in the eleventh hour at the end of 2022. She was left without a team for the next season until she was swept up in time for Paris-Roubaix by American squad Human Powered Health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>48.

An exciting central European talent, stage wins at the 2023 Giro and the 2024 Tour proved the Hungarian’s hype on the Grand Tour stage – even if she didn’t drop back to help Demi Vollering who crashed on that Tour stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Vas has been a consistent performer at international races despite her lack of teammates. She finished in fourth at the 2021 Worlds and the 2024 Paris <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics </a>after getting swamped by Kristen Faulkner in the final 5km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, she’s a hot and cold rider. When she’s on good form, she’s often one of the strongest, but those days seem to be few and far between. She’s still young and I reckon she’ll become more consistent on the road in the seasons to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>47.

However, what might come as a surprise is that Bastianelli has finished inside the top 40 of the UCI rankings each year from 2020 until 2023, the year she retired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was a core figure at second-tier races during the 2020s, claiming wins at races including the Omloop van het Hageland, the Festival Elsy Jacobs and Le Samyn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was still a consistent top ten finisher at WorldTour races though. A solid sprinter in her own right, the Italian crept into the top ten of almost every Belgian Classic she’d enter in 2022. Add in a top five finish at Paris-Roubaix, a runners-up spot on a Tour stage and the Omloop Het Nieuwsbald, and I think it’s clear that Bastianelli made her mark on her third decade in the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>46.

In total, she has 18 wins during her stint in the peloton so far in the 2020s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early part of the decade, Sierra swept the Giro Toscana and finished in second at the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. After making the step up with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/movistar\" target=\"_blank\">Movistar </a>in 2022, Sierra has been easy to spot in her distinct Cuban national champion’s jersey. In her debut season with the team, she picked up a stage win at the Tour de Romandie as well as a couple of stages of the Vuelta Andalucia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, she was visible at the head of the cobbled Classics, but her crowning moment would come at the Pan American Championships where she scooped up another gold medal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, Sierra has been a fixture of the UCI rankings since the turn of the decade. She’s finished every season inside the top 40 of the rankings since 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>45.

Bluntly put, she was <em>the </em>sprinter of the season, often winning multiple times during the same stage race. This year, she was edged into the second spot on six occasions by her compatriot Lorena Wiebes. However, later into the season, Kool stepped up at the Baloise Ladies Tour and the Tour de France where she opened the race in style with two stage wins, placing her in the <em>maillot jaune</em> for two days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eleven of Kool’s victories have been on the WorldTour level at the UAE Tour, Vuelta Femenina, RideLondon, Simac Ladies Tour and the aforementioned Tour de France. She’s given us enough evidence to show that she’s one of the fastest around, however, she is very much a one-dimensional rider. She doesn’t dabble in the cobbled Classics and can’t pack a punch on a more rolling profile. That’s what keeps me from moving her into the top ten.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11.

Since then, the FDJ-Suez rider added two Giro dell’Emilia titles and a World Championships medal to that selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until this year, she was consistently in the top ten of the UCI rankings, mainly thanks to her omnipresence in the Ardennes Classics and hilly stage races. Her GC results have also proven fruitful with top ten results at the Tour, Vuelta and Giro throughout the decade. This helps fight her case for making it into our top ten, and she will certainly help her new team Canyon-SRAM next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.

A time-trialist and Classics titan, the Swiss has been a captivating figure to follow in the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser broke through to the top bracket of pro cycling in 2020. In that formative year, she claimed her first international medals at the European and World Championships. From then, she translated this time-trialing form into road race results. A stage win at the Vuelta paved the way to a podium finish overall that year. After signing to SD Worx in 2022, she became a key figure for the squad in the Belgian Classics. She worked on behalf of Lotte Kopecky to help her secure big wins at the Tour of Flanders. A stage win on the gravel roads at the Tour de France Femmes gave some vindication of her road racing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2023 saw Reusser’s best season to date with a dominant solo win at a rainy Gent-Wevelgem, two major stage race victories at the Tour de Suisse and Itzulia Basque Country, and to top it all off, another stage win at the Tour de France. Despite abandoning the World Championships time-trial, Reusser lit up the road race the weekend after and took a hard-earned fourth place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still in keeping with her time-trialing strongsuit, Reusser has added several World Championships medals to her <em>palmarès</em> alongside an Olympic silver and three European Championships gold medals against the clock. She’s been off with a long-term illness this season but will hopefully bounce back next year with Movistar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

With that, let’s park Vos’s over 200 wins from previous decades and take a look at her post-pandemic results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evergreen Dutch rider has enjoyed plenty of success this decade. Challenged by a new crop of riders, she has settled the score at a number of WorldTour races with stage wins at the Tour of Scandinavia, Simac Ladies Tour and the Volta a Catalunya, a race she won overall earlier this year. On top of these, Vos has been a fixture in the Classics with victories at the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Amstel Gold Race and Gent-Wevelgem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Grand Tours, few riders have a record that rivals Vos’s. She’s claimed a Tour stage win, spent some time in the <em>maillot jaune</em> and secured two points classification contests. She has also carried this success across to the Giro and Vuelta where she has also claimed stage honours on several occasions since the turn of the decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She’s still pretty good, we can say that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

She’s claimed the most stage wins of any rider, male or female, since the turn of the decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a select few GC wins at flat stage races, Wiebes will forever be the first woman to claim a stage of the Tour de France Femmes. She’s won two more since then and the 25-year-old has also won the Ronde van Drenthe and Scheldeprijs on four consecutive occasions. If that wasn’t enough, she’s captured wins at Gent-Wevelgem and Brugge-De Panne and at almost every major women’s stage race including all three Grand Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in two European titles and it’s easy to understand why the Dutchwoman makes it so high on this list.

Over the past three seasons, she has transitioned into the best climber in the sport and the undeniable GC favourite at any race she enters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, Vollering has a Tour de France win and a Vuelta win under her belt, she’s bagged three Tour stages, a string of UCI WorldTour stage race leader’s jerseys and the Vélo d’Or. If you needed any more justification, Vollering has spent the past four seasons in the top three places in the UCI rankings. Even placing wins to one side, she has cracked the podium at all three Grand Tours, narrowly missing out on a title defence at the Tour earlier this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Classics have also proved fruitful for the Dutch rider – that is, after all,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\"> where she made a name for herself back in the early 2020s</a>. Vollering claimed a rare Ardennes triple crown in 2023. That same year, she found herself on the podium at the World Championships. She has also won Strade Bianche, Brabantse Pijl and La Course by Le Tour titles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

Her heyday stretched from the 2010s up until 2023 when she was still winning Grand Tour titles just a couple of months before retiring from the sport. To me, it’s a no-brainer to place her at number one on this list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2020, Van Vleuten has championed a staggering total of six Grand Tours. If she hadn’t crashed out of the 2020 Giro, it would have most likely been seven. The Dutch rider has wrangled a number of high-profile Classics wins across both cobbles and hills. Tour of Flanders, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, the UCI World Championships, Strade Bianche – I could go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Vleuten’s 2022 season alone should land her in the top spot. She claimed all three Grand Tours, the rainbow jersey, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. No season ever in women’s cycling – or even men’s cycling – comes close to beating this. She was untouchable, even at the age of 39, mind you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No rider on this list has dominated all types of terrains like Annemiek van Vleuten has throughout the 2020s. Demi Vollering might challenge this in the years to come, but Van Vleuten’s dominance from 2020 to mid-2023 will most likely not be seen again in the women’s sport.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best pro cycling jerseys of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best women’s one-day races of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-mens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s one-day races of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best women’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\">Top 50 women’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"49ee807138dfe28bc7de91ca2431038341e184b9b01d177dcb58a0a7216da95b","category":"Cycling"}
