I have no idea if it’s true, though I can quite imagine this happening in an era when riders stuck pins in their legs to stop cramp and only raced on tubulars that had been ‘seasoned’ – stored in a dark room for several months in the belief this hardened the treads, thereby making for faster, more puncture-resistant tyres. But I digress. The point is, Maître Jacques was onto something. How much your bike weighs is absolutely crucial.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-cycling-body-image\">Opinion: Cycling still has a body image problem</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-rim-brakes\">Opinion: Save the rim brake!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uphill-battle-aero-vs-lightweight-field-test\">Aero vs. lightweight bike: Which is better for climbing?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Let’s consider Anquetil’s situation: climbing. Now, I did maths at A-Level, which was a long time ago, so please cut me some slack, but in mechanics I know that ‘work = force x distance’. Force is defined as mass (in kg) multiplied by gravity (9.81m/s²), so the equation for the energy needed to climb a mountain is ‘work = mass x gravity x height’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"968\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/05025119/ofs_anquetil_giro_1964_01-970x968.jpg\" alt=\"ofs_anquetil_giro_1964_01\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Imagine scenario A: Jacques (70kg + 10kg bike) is climbing Mont Ventoux (vertical gain 1,601m), that means his work done is 80 × 9.81 × 1,601 = 1,256,465 joules. But we are cyclists, so we don’t know what joules means. But we do know a watt is the equivalent power of a joule per second (J/s), so if Anquetil is to make his ascent in a respectable 70 minutes (4,200 seconds), his power output must average 1,256,465/4,200 = 299W. (This obviously ignores air and rolling resistance which are important real-world factors, so his actual output would need to be higher. Please don’t write in.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s imagine scenario B, in which we add a kilo to Anquetil’s bike and ask him to make the same time. Suddenly his required power shoots up by a whopping… <em>three watts</em>. Ahem. Not as much as I thought. Still, it’s a useful takeaway: the relationship between weight and watts is directly proportional, so if you increase weight by X%, you increase the necessary wattage to fight gravity by X%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The spin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s consider the energy cost of weight in terms of food, because fast riders are fuelled riders. A kilocalorie (how we tend to measure our food, erroneously known as a calorie) is roughly 4.2kJ, so in scenario A, Anquetil needs to eat around 300kcal to crest Ventoux, or about 200g of pheasant and a glass of champers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131356/honey_stinger_waffles_cycling_food-970x592.jpeg\" alt=\"honey_stinger_waffles_cycling_food\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131356/honey_stinger_waffles_cycling_food-970x592.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131356/honey_stinger_waffles_cycling_food-300x183.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131356/honey_stinger_waffles_cycling_food-768x469.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131356/honey_stinger_waffles_cycling_food-750x458.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131356/honey_stinger_waffles_cycling_food.jpeg 1048w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scenario B Jacques needs a whole 3.74kcal more, that’s… a twelfth of a ginger nut. I can see I’m not convincing you. But let’s move Anquetil’s bidon (call it 600g) from his bike to his jersey pocket and… nothing changes. Only I swear it does, it really does. Weight matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, have you ever ridden a heavy bike versus a light bike? Like a 6.8kg bike versus an 8.5kg. They feel totally different. I admit that if you weigh, as I do, 80kg, a 1.7kg increase in bike represents a 2% increase in rider + bike weight, which sounds negligible. Until you consider the act of climbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you stand up and throw the bike side to side as you pedal. Like a pendulum, it moves left-right through an arc. If that bike is lighter, you have less mass to move, therefore it’s easier to move a lighter bike side to side and therefore it is easier to climb on a lighter bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much easier? 1.7kg is a 25% increase to a 6.8kg bike, and since work = force × distance, that means the 8.5kg bike takes 25% more energy to swing side to side on a climb – so Anquetil’s Bidon is right. What is this energy costed out in terms of watts, poultry or biscuits? I don’t know. Remember that maths A-Level? I needed extra tutoring to pass so as not to disappoint my father (both a maths teacher and disappointable). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But weight <em>has</em> to mean something. Otherwise why would professionals curse heavy bikes? Why would every new bike promise to be lighter? Are you seriously telling me the pros are wrong and bike manufacturers don’t have my best interests at heart?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/05/02112802/performance_weight_loss_1-970x618.jpg\" alt=\"performance_weight_loss_1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/05/02112802/performance_weight_loss_1-970x618.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/05/02112802/performance_weight_loss_1-300x191.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/05/02112802/performance_weight_loss_1-768x490.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/05/02112802/performance_weight_loss_1-750x478.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/05/02112802/performance_weight_loss_1-1140x727.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/05/02112802/performance_weight_loss_1.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then consider this: <em>where</em> weight is located on a bike matters loads. A spinning wheel takes energy both to rotate as well as to be moved forward – it’s why if you put a bike upside down and turn the pedals it still takes a fair amount of effort to spin the rear wheel. It’s also why I defy anyone not to feel the difference between pedalling off on a pair of Mavic Aksiums (1,905g) versus a pair of Brisk Ultralight wheels (720g – yes really. Tubs, though).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.pinkbike.com/news/why-you-shouldnt-worry-about-weight-much.html\" target=\"_blank\">an excellent exposition</a> by Seb Stott at PinkBike, he explains that saving weight at the rotating edge of a wheel (eg, a lighter rim and tyre) is worth double the saving in the frame. Or in other words, saving 100g on tyres is the same as shaving 200g from your frame or non-moving components. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what of the moving components such as cranks or the shoes attached to them? This principle extends to them too, and thus proves my point. Ex-pro Adam Hansen made himself 76g carbon shoes and rode 20 consecutive Grand Tours. You join the dots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight matters, everywhere. It’s science and I swear I can feel it.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/does-bike-weight-matter\">Opinion: Weight matters</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c58d4e2dedc89752177ac85538128f08630f50e78854a6025dd4bdb12aaaeed3","category":"Cycling"}
