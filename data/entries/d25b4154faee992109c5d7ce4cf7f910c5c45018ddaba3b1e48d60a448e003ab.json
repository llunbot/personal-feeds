Their spacecraft, a lander named <em>Athena</em>, was beginning its final descent down to the lunar surface.</p>\n<p>A little more than a year had passed since the company's first attempt to land on the Moon with a similarly built vehicle, <em>Odysseus</em>. Due to problems with that spacecraft's laser rangefinder, it skidded into the Moon's surface and toppled over.</p>\n<p>So engineers at Intuitive Machines had checked, and re-checked, the laser-based altimeters on <em>Athena</em>. When the lander got down within about 30 km of the lunar surface, they tested the rangefinders again. Worryingly, there was some noise in the readings as the laser bounced off the Moon. However, the engineers had reason to believe that, maybe, the readings would improve as the spacecraft got nearer to the surface.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/intuitive-machines-second-attempt-to-land-on-the-moon-also-went-sideways/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/intuitive-machines-second-attempt-to-land-on-the-moon-also-went-sideways/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d25b4154faee992109c5d7ce4cf7f910c5c45018ddaba3b1e48d60a448e003ab","category":"Tech"}
