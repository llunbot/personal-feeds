A casual observer might have come to that conclusion after almost a year of stories in the media about EVs languishing on lots and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/car-dealers-say-they-cant-sell-evs-tell-biden-to-slow-their-rollout/\">letters to the White House</a> asking for a national electrification mandate <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/new-epa-doe-fuel-regs-give-automakers-longer-to-reduce-co2-emissions/\">to be watered down or rolled back</a>. EVs were even a pain point during last year's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/striking-uaw-workers-win-key-battery-plant-concession-from-general-motors/\">auto worker industrial action</a>.

EV sales in 2023 grew by 47 percent year on year, but the first three months of this year failed to show such massive growth. In fact, sales in Q1 2024 were up only 2.6 percent over the same period in 2023.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029773#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029773&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
