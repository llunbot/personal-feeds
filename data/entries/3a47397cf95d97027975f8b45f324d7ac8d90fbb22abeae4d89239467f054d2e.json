These kinds of \"immersive sims\" are known for letting players maneuver through a \"clockwork world\" where characters go about their daily lives and players complete larger, open-ended objectives. So it's a bit of a surprise to see the developers shifting to a more direct kind of looting and grinding-action RPG with the horror fantasy of <i>Redfall</i>.</p>\n<p>After spending time with a single-player preview build of <i>Redfall</i>, I could still make out some hints of Arkane’s signature open-ended style amid the vampire slaying. But it's still a noticeable shift from the bleak worlds of <i>Prey</i> and <i>Dishonored</i>, with a team of charismatic vampire hunters that bring the vibe of <i>Buffy: The Vampire Slayer</i> to the gameplay of <i>Borderlands</i>.</p>\n<h2>Welcome to Redfall</h2>\n<p>The titular town of Redfall has come down with a bad case of vampires and human cultists. Together, these forces have created a supernatural eclipse that blocks out the sun, allowing the forces of the night to retain control of the town at all hours. Armed with tricked-out guns and makeshift vampire-killing weapons, your ragtag crew of supernatural experts has been sent in to retake the town while also uncovering the town’s mysterious history.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925441#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925441&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3a47397cf95d97027975f8b45f324d7ac8d90fbb22abeae4d89239467f054d2e","category":"Tech"}
