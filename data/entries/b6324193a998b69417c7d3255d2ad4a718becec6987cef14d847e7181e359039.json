The diabetes module monitors Electrochemical Skin Conductance, which allows it to detect signs of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathies that can lead to diabetic foot ulcers. Peripheral neuropathies are one of the most common diabetic complications, according to Withings, and as of now, are checked for only at annual doctor visits.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe scale works out of the box and requires no setup thanks to its cellular connection, which is able to transmit data securely to care teams. In addition to diabetes management, it has a number of other features, including support for tailored messages that can show up on the display, an eyes-closed mode that hides weight readings and instead provides motivational messages, and tools for measuring body composition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe scale is able to recognize patients using a ProgramMemberID feature that ensures that care teams are getting readings from the right person, plus there is an \"engagement score\" to allow for tailored coaching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore information about the Body Pro 2 can be <a href=\"https://withingshealthsolutions.com/devices/body-pro-2-2/\">found on the Withings website</a>. As this is designed to be provided through a medical facility, pricing is not available.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/withings/\">Withings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/withings-smart-scale-diabetes-management/\">Withings Launches Smart Scale That Helps With Diabetes Management</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/withings-launches-smart-scale-that-helps-with-diabetes-management.2410978/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b6324193a998b69417c7d3255d2ad4a718becec6987cef14d847e7181e359039","category":"Apple"}
