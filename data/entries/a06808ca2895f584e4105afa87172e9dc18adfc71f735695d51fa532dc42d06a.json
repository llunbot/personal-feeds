Her setup is heavily inspired by the equipment I’ve used myself over the past few years. I’m happy to pay tribute to these objects that have accompanied me. I didn’t mention any brands, but you might be able to recognize some of these products.</p>\n<p>I have to admit that Vera’s bike is unusually luxurious for someone living on social benefits. Of course, there’s a very good explanation! One day I’ll do a comic to tell the story of how Vera and Mary came to own their super bikes, on the occasion of a big trip.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-2.jpg?fit=1200,780&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-2.jpg?resize=1200,468&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-2.jpg?resize=768,300&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-2.jpg?resize=1536,599&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Vera made her own bags in a shared workshop that provides access to machines. Unfortunately, the pattern for these hip packs isn’t available online for real. This model doesn’t exist as such, but it is heavily inspired by the design of a well-known saddle bag.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1005\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-3.jpg?fit=1200,1005&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-3.jpg?resize=1200,603&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-3.jpg?resize=768,386&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/article-picture-3.jpg?resize=1536,772&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Unlike her bike, Vera’s tent is a budget-friendly model (by this community’s standards, right? Most of my friends would be horrified by the price). For cooking while camping, she uses a rather special pot! I found this pot in an antiques store. I didn’t understand what it was meant for, but I thought it would be handy for camping. It has been very useful to me because it can serve as a cup or a pot, and its lid allows you to drain pasta! I only recently learned that it’s actually a pot designed to collect grease from cooking meat or fish. I think this item would be more popular if it were sold in outdoor shops.</p>\n<p>See you soon for the sixth chapter of The Witches Cycle!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/witches-cycle-chapter-five/\">The Witches Cycle – Chapter 5: Concrete Road’s Groundwork</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a06808ca2895f584e4105afa87172e9dc18adfc71f735695d51fa532dc42d06a","category":"Cycling"}
