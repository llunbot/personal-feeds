Recent court documents have shown just how much Google pays Apple to be the default search engine across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-28/microsoft-discussed-selling-bing-to-apple-as-google-replacement&amp;xcust=1-1-2095321-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Microsoft reportedly pitched selling Bing to Apple</a> back in 2020, but with Google paying Apple billions of dollars a year to remain the default, Apple decided against it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have also been reports of Apple building its own search technology, with crawlers indexing the web to provide answers to common Siri questions and such. It fueled further speculation (yet again) that Apple would launch its own search engine, though that doesn’t appear to be happening any time soon. Apple’s new next-generation search technology is allegedly code-named “Pegasus” and it is already in use to index and find content within some Apple apps (like TV or Maps), and may soon extend to other apps or services, like the App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like, for searching the web, Apple users that use Safari (which is most of them) are going to be stuck with Google as the default search for quite some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you don’t have to use Google if you don’t want to! Buried within settings, where 99.9 percent of the users will never look, is the option to change search engines. Here’s how you can change your Safari search default on iPhone/iPad and Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  2 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: none</li><li>Materials required: iPhone, iPad, or Mac</li><li>Cost: 0</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Change search default on iPhone or iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-safari-search.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone change safari search\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>To change your default search engine in Safari on iPhone or iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Safari</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Search Engine.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>To select a different search engine for use in private browsing windows, tap <em>Private Search Engine</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You should have several to choose from, but they may vary by region. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Change search default on Mac</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mac-safari-search.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac safari search\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>To change the search default on Mac, you’ll need to access Safari’s preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Launch Safari.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the menu bar, select <em>Safari</em> and then <em>Settings</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the <em>Search</em> tab.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the <em>Search engine</em> drop-down box to see and change between available search engines.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the <em>Private Browsing search engine</em> drop-down if you wish to use a different search engine when in a private browser window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As with iOS and iPadOS, the available search engines may vary by region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s actually possible to change search engines on the fly in Safari on macOS.
