Double check important information.\"</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Summarized notifications are now shown with the text italicized to distinguish them from standard notifications.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Notification Summaries can be disabled on a per-app basis directly from the Lock Screen by swiping on a notification and tapping on the \"Options\" button to get to an interface for turning off summaries.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nAll of the Notification Summary changes have been made in iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3.\r<br />\n<h2>Camera Control</h2>\r<br />\nOn <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, the Camera Control section in the Settings has a renamed toggle. The toggle for AE/AF lock has been renamed to \"Lock Focus and Exposure,\" which would be clearer to non-photographers who do not know what AE/AF Lock is.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/ios-18-3-lock-focus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nLock Focus and Exposure is an optional setting that lets you lock your settings with a light press and hold on the Camera Control button, and it is meant to work similarly to a DSLR camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Messages</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Messages sidebar that's accessible by tapping on the \"+\" button in any conversation, there is now a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> entry, and tapping it takes you to the ‌Genmoji‌ creation interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/ios-18-3-genmoji-messages.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThis is simply another way to get to the ‌Genmoji‌ creation tools, which have previously been available by tapping on the emoji keyboard button.\r<br />\n<h2>PDF Editing</h2>\r<br />\nWhen editing a PDF through the screenshot interface, if you crop content out, Apple now provides a warning that cropped content is not removed from the PDF.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/ios-18-3-pdf-crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n\"Content outside the cropped area won't be visible in most PDF viewers, but it can be made visible in some apps,\" reads the message.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Features</h2>\r<br />\nKnow of something new in the latest iOS 18.3 beta that we left out?
