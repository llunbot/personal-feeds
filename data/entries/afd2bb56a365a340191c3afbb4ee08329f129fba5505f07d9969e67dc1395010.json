And in this post-Covid world, some issues linger on with photographers’ proximity to the riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The powers that be started to enforce masks on photographers when it was 40°C in the south of France. I do get it, but I’m not getting any closer than the drunk people on the side of the road setting off flares and screaming in the riders’ faces. I’m just trying to show their personalities and who they are as people, which will hopefully allow potential fans to relate more easily to them and to the sport.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advent of social media and diversified cycling content such as the Netflix series <em>Tour de France: Unchained, </em>it would seem we have more access to riders than ever, and Williams thinks we shouldn’t take it for granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The more I know about them as people, the more I’m going to cheer for them. Tadej Pogačar has nailed it. He’s back-flipping into the pool on the rest day. Magnus Cort is showing us the awful hotel rooms he has to stay in, and Matteo Jorgensen was incredibly vulnerable and open after losing that devastating stage to Pogačar. You can’t script that kind of raw human stuff and providing access is essential for the sport’s future.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In order to make his own contribution to this coverage, Williams is happy to do a bit of roughing it over the course of the three weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I travel with a few of my colleagues and we camp. It’s nice how simple it is compared to staying in hotels. At times it is diabolically hot or pouring with rain, but then you might get a sunset over the campsite. One time we were staying in a site outside of Nîmes and there was a foam party with a DJ playing to loads of kids in rural France. Totally bizarre. Other times there’s barely a tap.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Proper planning prevents…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The scale of the Tour de France is legendary so it’s very much a case of ‘fail to prepare, prepare to fail’. As Williams stresses, photographers must toe the line to stay on the right side of the authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You can drive in front of the race and behind the broom wagon, but if you get caught inside the convoy your accreditation goes in the bin and it’s game over. It’s not worth the risk. Plus, our car was registered in the UK so the police disliked us before we’d even opened our mouths. Overall, the Tour is just chaos. It’s bigger than anything else. You forget how big it is. The number of vehicles and generators and trucks is wild.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning is essential, especially for photographers who aren’t on official motos. They need to navigate their way around the course and are extremely limited in terms of where they can stop. As with anything, though, luck will occasionally trump hours of planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘On the last stage of the Tour I managed to get a shot of Pogačar hugging his photographer – him just beaming, covered in sweat and a bottle of water pouring down his face. He’s looking straight down the barrel of my camera. That was dead lucky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You get lucky and unlucky every day with bits and pieces; you just have to keep putting yourself in the right situations and hope it comes off.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Main image (top):</strong> ‘Back in 2019, covering my first ever Tour de France, I shot Julian Alaphilippe at this exact same angle on the same descent of the Col du Galibier, and it was the first image I thought was up to scratch. This is the defining image of this year’s race because this was the day Tadej Pogačar went into yellow and he stayed there for the rest of the race. It was personally important for me to get the opportunity to go back to the same spot.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Tour de France photography\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Zac Williams</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘This was at the end of Stage 3, which Biniam Girmay won.
