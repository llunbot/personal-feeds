There’s iOS 17.3 and macOS 14.3 (and their siblings), which started beta-testing in December. We can also expect new Apple TV+ shows and Apple Arcade games. Here’s a summary of what we might see this month. If we don’t get Apple Vision Pro, it’s shaping up to be a very slow month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware: Apple Vision Pro?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2190490/vision-pro-launch-early-2024-january-shipping.html\">Recent reports</a> indicate that Apple’s next big thing, their early foray into “spatial computing” with an AR/VR headset, could launch at the end of January. The reports claim that Apple Vision Pro has entered mass production and will begin shipping to distribution centers soon, which would indicate a launch in late January or early February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior reports also claimed the headset would come early in the year. When it was introduced at WWDC, Apple gave a release window of “early next year” which typically means around March, but there have been exceptions–and entirely new product categories often debut on their own timetable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At $3,500, plus a cost for lens inserts for those who need them, Vision Pro is expected to be a very low-volume business. We don’t expect large shipments and millions of units sold in 2024. But it’s the first product in a brand new category that Apple is taking <em>very</em> seriously. We can’t wait to see the finished product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a new wave of OS updates entering beta in mid-December, it seems a sure thing that we’ll get a final release in January. That will probably be followed almost immediately by beta releases of the next iOS/iPadOS/macOS/tvOS updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 17.3:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2169796/ios-17-3-beta-features-release-stolen-device-protection.html\">This release</a> adds collaborative playlists to Apple Music (after a few earlier betas teasing the feature), but the big deal is probably the new Stolen Device Protection feature that helps make it harder for a thief to access your personal data even if they have your passcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPadOS 17.3:</strong> Expect the same updates as in iOS 17.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‌<strong>tvOS 17.3:</strong> We’re not aware of any significant new features in tvOS 17.3 yet. Apple Music is available on tvOS, but we don’t know if collaborative playlists can be managed on the device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Sonoma 14.3:</strong> We haven’t noticed any significant features in the 14.3 release (outside of the usual bug fixes and security stuff), with the exception of collaborative playlists in Apple Music. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in January.
