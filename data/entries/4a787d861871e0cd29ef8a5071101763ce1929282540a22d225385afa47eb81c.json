Now you can stop riding your suspension into the ground and ride a new Trek while your steed is getting serviced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participating Trek retailers are able to get your fork, shock, or dropper post (or all three) back to you within 14 days in most cases. And they’ll let you demo something new while they have it, even an e-bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, you don’t have to have a Trek bike to have the Trek shop handle your suspension repair or service. They’ll pull the part of any bike, and can service most RockShox, FOX, Marzocchi, and Manitou suspension products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Services offered include fork and shock air sleeve maintenance, fork and shock damper overhauls (recommended every 200 hours of riding time), and dropper post rebuilds (recommended every 200 hours of riding time). Bundle them with a full-service package for their bikes and get drivetrain, hubs, or other moving parts tuned up, too. Or not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find a nearest <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fstore-finder%2F\" target=\"_blank\">participating Trek retailer here</a> and their <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fservice%2F\" target=\"_blank\">service menu here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-offers-faster-suspension-service-free-loaner-bikes/\">Trek Offers Faster Suspension Service &amp; Free Loaner Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4a787d861871e0cd29ef8a5071101763ce1929282540a22d225385afa47eb81c","category":"Cycling"}
