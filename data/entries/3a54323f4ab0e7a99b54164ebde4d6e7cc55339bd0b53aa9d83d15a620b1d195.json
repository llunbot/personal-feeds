Yet after a significant update to the ‌iPad Pro‌ that introduced a thinner design and OLED displays and a minor ‌iPad Air‌ refresh that added the M3 chip, how different are the two product lines and which should you buy?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-2024-vs-iPad-Air-2024-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple recently refreshed the ‌iPad Air‌ with the M3 chip—a minor update over the previous model from 2024 which added the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> hover. The latest ‌iPad Pro‌ models introduced a large number of significant new changes, such as the M4 chip, OLED displays, and a higher price point, and it means that the high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models are now further differentiated from the ‌iPad Air‌ than before.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould you consider purchasing the ‌iPad Air‌ to save money, or do you need the high-end features of the ‌iPad Pro‌?

For most people, the additional $400+ needed to buy the ‌iPad Pro‌ is not justified to get the likes of ‌Face ID‌, four-speaker audio, and a ProMotion OLED display with refresh rates up to 120Hz.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome ‌iPad Pro‌ features, such as LiDAR, up to 16GB of memory, and Thunderbolt connectivity are only practically useful to a small niche of users and most will never use some of these high-end capabilities. Many features such as Audio zoom and stereo audio recording may not be meaningfully utilized by many users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProfessionals who have a clear use case for needing larger amounts of RAM and storage, a matte display, Thunderbolt connectivity, and OLED for HDR content will clearly benefit from buying the ‌iPad Pro‌. That being said, \"prosumer\"-style customers who simply want the best ‌iPad‌ will enjoy features such as 120Hz ProMotion for smoother scrolling and gaming, deeper blacks and more vivid colors with the OLED display, and the Adaptive True Tone flash for document scanning, even if they are not necessary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeyond these individual circumstances, the ‌iPad Air‌ is the best value for money and will be more than ample for most users' needs. With the ‌iPad Air‌, users can get a modern all-screen design, the M3 chip, practical features like USB-C and 5G connectivity, and compatibility with the core Apple accessories for a price well below that of the ‌iPad Pro‌.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-air-vs-ipad-pro/\">iPad Air vs. iPad Pro Buyer's Guide: 30 Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-vs-ipad-pro-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2425868/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a54323f4ab0e7a99b54164ebde4d6e7cc55339bd0b53aa9d83d15a620b1d195","category":"Apple"}
