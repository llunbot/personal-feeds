The AirPods wireless earbuds are among Apple’s most commercially successful devices, while the Apple Watch will next year celebrate its tenth anniversary and gets major stage time at the company’s events. Both devices would obviously benefit from increased battery life, with the Apple Watch in particular frequently compared unfavorably with simpler rival devices such as Fitbits which can be charged less often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important, of course, to remember how slowly such developments tend to progress, and even if Apple shows an interest in incorporating TDK’s new tech in its products they are unlikely to appear for some years.
