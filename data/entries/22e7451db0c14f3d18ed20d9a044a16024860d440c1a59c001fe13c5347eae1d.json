The chips are \"designed to set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs\" and are being developed by the Nuvia team. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/qualcomm-to-acquire-chip-startup-nuvia/\">Qualcomm acquired Nuvia</a>, a chip startup company founded by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/30/gerard-williams-iii-departs-apple/\">former Apple chip designers</a>, for $1.4 billion earlier this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nQualcomm said that it will directly compete with Apple's M-series chips, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/\">M1 Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a>, and hopes to lead the industry for \"sustained performance and battery life.\" Moreover, the company promised that it would be scaling up its Adreno GPUs to offer desktop-class gaming capabilities in future PCs. Qualcomm hopes to be able to send samples to clients in around nine months, ahead of the first products containing the chips launching in 2023.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arm/\">Arm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/qualcomm-new-pc-chips-to-combat-apple-silicon/\">Qualcomm Looking to Combat Apple Silicon With New Generation of PC Chips</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/qualcomm-looking-to-combat-apple-silicon-with-new-generation-of-pc-chips.2323629/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nxq8LkCarQI:vGBsyo_csLQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nxq8LkCarQI:vGBsyo_csLQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"22e7451db0c14f3d18ed20d9a044a16024860d440c1a59c001fe13c5347eae1d","category":"Apple"}
