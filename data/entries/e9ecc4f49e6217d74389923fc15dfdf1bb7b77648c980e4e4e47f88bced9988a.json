Unusually in this day and age, it features a near-V rim profile, albeit one that claims better performance and handling than old-school V-section designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 46mm deep carbon wheelset is available at three levels: AR, Blacklabel Expert and the highest spec Blacklabel Pro. All use the same 46mm deep, 31mm external width carbon rim, but with different hubs and spokes, which results in wheelset weights between 1,397g and 1,604g. Prices run from £1,500 to £2,500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rim has an internal width of 21mm and a hooked bead for greater tyre compatibility than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\">hookless</a> design that is used by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-overhauls-race-performance-wheelsets-new-404-firecrest-and-454-nsw-designs\">Zipp</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/enve-updates-ses-wheelset-range\">Enve</a> in their latest wheelsets. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\">rim width</a> increases to 31mm at its widest point. As you’d expect, it’s tubeless-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"645\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Reynolds-rim-profile-1.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Reynolds-rim-profile-1.jpg 645w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Reynolds-rim-profile-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Reynolds-rim-profile-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Reynolds-rim-profile-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Reynolds-rim-profile-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Reynolds wheels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reynolds says that its rim profile, which is a blunt V-shape, works well in real-world riding conditions, rather than being only CFD and wind tunnel optimised. It claims unrivalled aerodynamics and also class-leading stability, with its DET2 profile optimised for ‘the innumerable yaw angles of wind a rider will encounter on the road’ and for 28mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reynolds points out that the stability aspect is important, as it allows the rider to maintain an efficient <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-win-against-the-wind\">aero body position</a> safely. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\">Road and gravel bike freehubs explained</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/wire-in-the-blood-inside-spoke-maker-sapim\">Wire in the blood: Inside spoke maker Sapim</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\">Best aero bikes 2023: Ride faster for less effort</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/which-is-faster-aero-vs-lightweight-wheels\">Which is faster: Aero vs lightweight wheels</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Most aero wheelset launches are awash with data on watts saved, yaw angles and the like, but Reynolds hasn’t provided any data on the new wheelset’s marginal gains, so we’ll have to take the brand’s word for it when it says that it’s best in class. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most modern wheelsets have adopted a blunt U-shaped profile, so Reynolds’ DET2 design offers something a bit different and is closer to the V-shape that older aero wheelsets typically adopted. The U-shape is generally claimed by wheel brands to confer greater crosswind stability, so <em>maybe</em> the blunted V-shape will offer the benefits of both the U and V-shaped profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multiple hub choices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/FB_REYNOLDS_MALOJAPUSH-23-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Reynolds wheels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top Blacklabel 46 Pro DB build has a hub co-developed by Reynolds and Industry9, the latter known for its offset pawl hubs. These provide very fast engagement, which in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/industry-nine-torch-i25-tl-review\">Torch hubs</a> used in the Blacklabel Pro wheelset is 6-degrees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Torch hubs are laced to the rims with 20 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/wire-in-the-blood-inside-spoke-maker-sapim\">Sapim </a>CX-Ray spokes at the front and 24 at the rear. Reynolds says that this gives them a 1,397g wheelset weight. They’re priced at £2,446, $2,300 or €2,330.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Move down the range and the Blacklabel 46 Expert DB wheels also have a co-developed hub, in this case the Reynolds/Ringlé Super Bubba X Road DB hub with a three-pawl mechanism with 9-degree engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same Sapim CX-Ray spokes are used to lace them to the rims, but in this case there are 24 spokes in the front hub as well as the rear. Reynolds quotes a 1,430g wheelset weight, while the wheelset price is £2,026, £1,900 or €1,930.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s yet another hub used in the least expensive AR 46 DB wheels, in this case a new Reynolds/Ringlé SRX Road DB hub with a three-pawl freehub offering 12 degree engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels use 24 Sapim Sprint spokes front and rear, with external brass nipples in place of the alloy internal nipples of the higher spec wheelsets. Quoted weight is 1,604g and the AR 46 DB wheelset is priced at £1,540, $1,450 or €1,470.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three wheelsets are available with 11-speed Shimano HGR, SRAM XDR or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/campagnolo-n3w-compatible-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo N3W</a> freehubs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Confused by freehubs?
