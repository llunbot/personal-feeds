As the ‌iPhone‌ 11 line does not support ‌Apple Intelligence‌, there are few features in iOS 18.3 for the devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update adds a new Calculator feature that causes the last mathematical operation to repeat when pressing the equals sign, and it fixes an issue where <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> playback could continue until a song ends even after the app was closed.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/03/apple-releases-new-ios-18-3-update-iphone-11/\">Apple Releases New Version of iOS 18.3 for iPhone 11</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-version-of-ios-18-3-for-iphone-11.2448670/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"521071af15ced5ad4348ccb043fcaf8d8ef417be03cd95dd3a971e1bfd969e24","category":"Apple"}
