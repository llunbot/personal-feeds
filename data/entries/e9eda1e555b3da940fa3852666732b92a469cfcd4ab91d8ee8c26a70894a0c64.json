Panorama Cycles has just updated their chromoly-framed Anticosti gravel bike with some modern features for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A gravel bike that’s also suitable for light touring or bikepacking excursions, the Anticosti is Panorama’s best-selling bike. The updated frame adds UDH compatibility, increased tire clearance, and routing for a dropper post cable. Panorama’s customizable build options include your choice of a carbon or chromoly fork, different dropper post options, single or double-ring drivetrains, and a high-end Rival AXS build.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Panorama Anticosti – Frame and Fork Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-side.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"734\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-side.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-side-297x182.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-side-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-side-768x470.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anticosti frames are built from custom-butted Reynolds 725 chromoly tubing, and all five available frame sizes get unique tube sets. The frames are treated with an electrodeposition surface treatment to protect them against corrosion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-Rival-AXS-derailleur.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-Rival-AXS-derailleur.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, AXS derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-Rival-AXS-derailleur.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-Rival-AXS-derailleur-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-Rival-AXS-derailleur-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-Rival-AXS-derailleur-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for updates, the newest generation Anticosti now offers UDH-compatible dropouts. They also get increased tire clearance, so the frame can now fit up to 29×2.1” treads. If you want to roll on 29ers you’ll have to swap the wheelset, as all three available models come stock with 700c wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-dropper-routing.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-dropper-routing.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, dropper post routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-dropper-routing.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-dropper-routing-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-dropper-routing-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-dropper-routing-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new frames also get updated with internal cable routing for dropper posts. The frame accepts 27.2mm posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features of the Anticosti include three water bottle mounts (on the top and bottom of the down tube and the seat tube), plus mounts for a top tube bag, rear rack, and fenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anticosti frame uses a 142x12mm Boost rear thru-axle, BSA 68mm threaded BB shell, and has a flat mount disc brake mount. The bike can run 1x or 2x drivetrains and has ample clearance for a 46t chainring.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, chromoly fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-chromoly-fork-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Panorama offers buyers the choice of a carbon or chromoly fork on any build spec. The 4130 chromoly fork includes plenty of mounts for accessories/racks, while the carbon fork still offers cargo mounts but also vibration-absorbing ride qualities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chromoly fork has a straight 1 1/8” steerer tube, and a flat mount for the disc brake. This fork also gets triple cargo cage mounts, mounts for low-rider and Nitto/Rivendale style racks, and fender mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, carbon fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-carbon-fork-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Panorama’s optional carbon fork has a tapered steerer tube. It gets the triple cargo cage mounts and fender mounts, but no low-rider rack mounts. This fork also features a flat mount for the disc brake.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-fork-crown.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-fork-crown.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, fork crown\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-fork-crown.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-fork-crown-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-fork-crown-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-fork-crown-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both fork options use 10x100mm axles and offer ample clearance for 29×2.1” tires. Either fork is also compatible with Dynamo hubs, with internal routing for the wiring and a mount for a headlight. Both forks come in Muted Blue to match the Anticosti frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anticosti’s geometry was designed to offer a comfortable ride on gravel, and versatility for longer bikepacking or light touring rides. See the chart below for all the figures and measurements for each frame size.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-1.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"950\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-1.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, geo chart 1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-1.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-1-297x235.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-1-120x95.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-1-768x608.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-2.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-2.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, geo chart 2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-2.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-2-297x84.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-2-120x34.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-2-768x218.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-3.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"159\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-3.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, geo chart 3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-3.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-3-297x39.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-3-120x16.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-geo-3-768x102.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Specs and Options:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-female-rider.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-female-rider.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, female rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-female-rider.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-female-rider-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-female-rider-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-female-rider-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Please note the bike pictured does not match the available build specs.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anticosti will be available as a frameset or a complete bike. The frame/fork retails for $1399. The Anticosti frame is only available in Muted Blue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complete bikes start at $3249, with custom build options available. Panorama builds their bikes to order, in-house at their workshop in Quebec, Canada. Given the available component options, exact prices were not provided for all the ‘stock’ builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Panorama is offering the Anticosti in three complete builds – The T1, T2 and T3. All three builds roll on the same wheelsets; Easton AR25 wheels with Maxxis Rambler 700x45c tires. The three builds also come with Ritchey Venture Max II handlebars, Cane Creek headsets, 160mm brake rotors front and rear, and WTB Volt saddles.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-front-end.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-front-end.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Anticosti, front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-front-end.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-front-end-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-front-end-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Panorama-Cycles-Anticosti-front-end-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All builds offer an option for either a Promax or Redshift Shockstop stem, and three different dropper post brands. Buyers can choose between a Kalloy SP-3D2, a OneUp Components dropper, or a Redshift Shockstop Endurance post.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum up the build specs, the T1 and T2 bikes are basically 1x or 2x Shimano GRX bikes. The T1 is 1×12, and the T2 is 2×12. The T3 model features a SRAM Rival eTap AXS 1×12 drivetrain.
