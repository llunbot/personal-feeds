But while it’s undeniably one of the lightest production road bikes ever – and sure to be a climber’s dream – Scott still manages to make this a viable modern race bike, with the latest in integration, race-worthy stiffness &amp; handling, improved rider comfort, and even enough aerodynamic tweaks to keep you going fast on the descents, as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now sure, we know that Scott’s complete 5.9kg Addict Rc build is going to cost a fortune (scroll all the way down to see how much!) But with such a lightweight starting point, even the entry-level build with 105 is going to be a featherweight…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_climbing-pair-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos by Brazo de Hierro/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been more than 5 years since we saw a ground-up redesign of Scott’s lightweight all-rounder road race bike. At first glance, this new version does not look all that different, really. The previous Addict was already a pretty advanced bike when we first saw it <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-addict-rc-road-bike-is-all-new-for-2020-more-integrated-aero-much-more/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2019</a>. But there’s still a lot to unpack in this new bike, beyond simply dropping a full kilo off the top-spec pro race-ready model!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that really was the starting point for the new Addict RC.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_new-ultimate-build-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_new-ultimate-build-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_new-ultimate-build-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_new-ultimate-build-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_new-ultimate-build-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_new-ultimate-build-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_new-ultimate-build-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott’s designers wanted to let racers pick whatever wheels and tires they wanted – going as far wider and more aerodynamic as they wanted – while still getting complete bike weights under the oft-discussed UCI 6.8kg weight limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest upgrades to the new Scott Addict RC come inside the frame. Scott says they’ve adopted the same inflatable polypropylene inserts from their lightweight Carbon mountain bike frame constructions to make their new road bike lighter, too. Essentially, by more accurately molding the inside of the frame and eliminating any dead-ends in the mold, Scott is able to eliminate a lot of excess resin in the process, reducing weight while maintaining the same level of strength &amp; stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it’s just a more precise location of carbon &amp; resin material inside the frameset.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, landscape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_landscape-bike-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Addict RC keeps a similar dropped seatstay design but does inherit some additional aerodynamic optimization inspired by the Foil &amp; Plasma. But here it is more balanced with weight reduction strategies, prioritizing key spots on the frame where stiffness to weight trumps aero. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, fully integrated front view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_clean-cockpit-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One example is the new bike’s internal routing. While the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-addict-rc-road-bike-is-all-new-for-2020-more-integrated-aero-much-more/\" target=\"_blank\">previous generation</a> Addict RC already fully integrated its cables and a 1.25-1.5″ tapered fork, Scott’s new headset &amp; internal cable routing paths allowed them to further reduce the width of the headtube for 10% lower frontal area. We don’t have the full specs on the new tapered steerer, but Scott mentions a 27.2mm eccentric profile at the top of the fork. That is 1 1/16″ instead of the standard 1 1/8″, so presumably a smaller diameter steerer helps keep everything thin, while maintaining steering stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_narrower-headtube-wider-fork-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_narrower-headtube-wider-fork-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, narrow headtube and wide fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_narrower-headtube-wider-fork-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_narrower-headtube-wider-fork-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_narrower-headtube-wider-fork-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_narrower-headtube-wider-fork-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_narrower-headtube-wider-fork-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the new fork also features wider-set legs for smoother airflow over all wheel &amp; tire widths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And follow that up with shallow but aero tube sections that mostly carry over from the previous generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More rider comfort</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_max-34mm-tire-clearance-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_max-34mm-tire-clearance-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, 34mm tire clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_max-34mm-tire-clearance-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_max-34mm-tire-clearance-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_max-34mm-tire-clearance-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_max-34mm-tire-clearance-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_max-34mm-tire-clearance-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of making the new Scott Addict RC more comfortable was bigger tires. Now even the pros often pick 30mm tires for their lower rolling resistance, better grip, and improved all-day comfort. So that’s the standard tire size spec for the new bike, but there’s enough room to go up to 34mm tire too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_new-seatpost-clamp-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_new-seatpost-clamp-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, new seatpost clamp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_new-seatpost-clamp-jpg.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_new-seatpost-clamp-180x300.webp 180w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_new-seatpost-clamp-72x120.webp 72w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_new-seatpost-clamp-768x1280.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_SL-seatpost-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_SL-seatpost-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, SL lightweight carbon seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_SL-seatpost-jpg.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_SL-seatpost-180x300.webp 180w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_SL-seatpost-72x120.webp 72w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_SL-seatpost-768x1280.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_CF-flex-seatpost-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_CF-flex-seatpost-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, CF comfort flex seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_CF-flex-seatpost-jpg.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_CF-flex-seatpost-180x300.webp 180w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_CF-flex-seatpost-72x120.webp 72w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_CF-flex-seatpost-768x1280.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big tweak is in the seatpost and how it is clamped in the frame. A new internal wedge from the top of the top tube is said to be gentler on clamping carbon. So, Scott was able to reduce the wall thickness in their SL seatpost, adding a bit more tuned flex and increasing comfort. They also add a new CF seatpost option that is a bit heavier but uses a reduced depth near the upper portion of the post to add even more flex, and a claimed 30% boost in rider comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Evolved race-ready geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_updated-geometry-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1885\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_updated-geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Scott Addict RC ultralight carbon road bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_updated-geometry-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_updated-geometry-297x280.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_updated-geometry-1536x1448.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_updated-geometry-120x113.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_updated-geometry-768x724.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott also adapted the new Addict’s geometry to be even slightly more aggressive than before to counteract the naturally more sluggish feel of wider, more comfortable modern road tires. So even though Scott specs all models of their lightweight road bike with 30mm tires, it retains the agile handling and quick steering that has been a hallmark of the Addict RC for 15 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time though, Scott ensured the new Addict RC would still have a stable and predictable ride at higher speeds and while descending, especially important on such a light bike so you don’t get blown off your line with a sudden wind gust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes are incremental, but designed to give all sizes of riders a fast but predictable ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_angled-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>ultralight HMX-SL carbon or lightweight HMX carbon framesets</li>\n\n\n\n<li>integrated fully internal cable routing through the headset</li>\n\n\n\n<li>electronic shift and disc brake only</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27.2mm eccentric carbon steerer tube fork (1 1/16″ vs. standard 1 1/8″)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>new 40g lighter 1-piece Syncros handlebar+stem cockpit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>new 12g 3D-printed truss direct out-front Syncros GPS mount is 70% lighter than the previous CNC’d version </li>\n\n\n\n<li>proprietary D-shaped aero seatpost – pick lighter SL or flex comfort CF versions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>internal wedge-type seatpost clamp</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12mm thru-axles &amp; flat mount disc brakes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PF86.5 bottom bracket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>34mm max tire clearance, with complete bikes delivered with 30mm tires</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI-approved-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI-approved-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI approveds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI-approved-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI-approved-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI-approved-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI-approved-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scott-Addict-RC-ultralight-carbon-road-bike_photo-by-Brazo-de-Hierro_UCI-approved-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>UCI approved frameset</li>\n\n\n\n<li>869g!
