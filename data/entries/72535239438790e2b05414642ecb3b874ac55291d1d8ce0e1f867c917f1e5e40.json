The luxury automaker wants all its vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2040, and parent company Honda is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/honda-to-spend-11-billion-on-four-ev-factories-in-north-america/\">investing billions of dollars</a> in electric vehicle manufacturing in North America to help that happen. But its homegrown EVs aren't quite ready yet, and in the meantime, Acura has resorted to a bit of platform-sharing to fill the gap. Scratch under the skin of the 2024 Acura ZDX Type-S and it's pure General Motors, using the same Ultium platform as the Cadillac Lyriq. But the polish is all Acura, including the software.</p>\n<p>The ZDX range starts at $64,500 for the single-motor, rear-wheel drive A-Spec model, which is similar in specs to the Cadillac Lyriq <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/\">we drove a couple of years ago</a>. But Acura brought the $73,500 2024 ZDX Type-S to the first drive. This is the top-spec model, with a 499 hp (372 kW), 544 lb-ft (738 Nm) twin-motor, all-wheel drive powertrain, air suspension, and rather large Brembo brakes.</p>\n<h2>It’s no lightweight</h2>\n<p>Those last two features are highly welcome, because they help control the ZDX Type-S's considerable mass—its curb weight is a hefty 6,052 lbs (2,745 kg). Air springs are fast becoming the default choice for premium EVs, and it's quite remarkable how quickly they can react to weight transfer. But the steering lacks feel and makes up for it with weight, and maneuvers like avoiding road debris on the highway will give you a definite reminder that you're driving nearly 3 tons of vehicle. You do get a smooth ride thanks to those air springs, though.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021077#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021077&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
