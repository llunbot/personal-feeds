Snow says that the head tube has then been CNC machined for an authentic look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most parts on the bike had to be developed from scratch – frame, fork, handlebars, shifter, saddle, sissy bar, rear carrier, chainset, chain guard, pedals, mudguards, tyres, rims, spoke protector and kickstand all had to be designed and engineered by the Raleigh team and re-made by our production partners,” says Snow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the parts are interchangeable with the original Mark 2 Chopper from the 1970s, although Raleigh says that it has had to make some changes to satisfy modern regulations, with the shape of the saddle and the “sissy bar” behind it, for example, being lower than that which was allowed fifty years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other details that Raleigh has replicated on the new Chopper include the working three-speed gear shifter, which is made in the UK, the saddle with its sprung rear, the Chopper decals and even the red stripe on the tyres on the mismatched 16” and 20” wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This new model is as close as we could get to the original Mk2 released in 1972, while still meeting today’s required standards. The Chopper is still seen by the Raleigh team as the jewel in the brand’s crown. A legacy to be admired, protected, and never forgotten,” says Lee Kidger, Raleigh’s managing director.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

as a limited edition, so it will be interesting to see whether it is a short-lived retro fad or if, like the original Chopper, which was a huge hit for the brand and sold in its millions, the new bike becomes a must-have for today’s teenagers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Raleigh Chopper is one of the most iconic bikes we have ever made, we hope the new Raleigh Chopper will transport people back to a fond memory, it’s nostalgic and fun,” Snow concludes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Costing £950, it’s certainly a more expensive purchase than the original, which is reported to have cost £32 when it was launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Chopper is one of a series of retro relaunches by the Nottingham-based company, recreating designs from when it was a major force in UK cycling. It’s previously worked with the same manufacturer in Taiwan to relaunch the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/raleigh-tuff-burner-40th-anniversary-edition\">Tuff Burner BMX bike</a> from the 1980s. There’s even been a replica of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/remembering-a-legend-joop-zoetemelk-s-ti-raleigh-creda-replica-bike\">Raleigh-Creda bike</a> on which Joop Zoetemelk won the Tour de France in 1980. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other bikes from the 1970s that are still going strong. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/brompton-folding-bikes-a-full-guide-to-the-range\">Brompton</a> is another classic British bike design that was first sold in 1976 and is still selling well today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Raleigh Chopper specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Raleigh Chopper 2023 pack shot\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Raleigh-Chopper-Product-May-230250-copy.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Raleigh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frame:</strong> C-Mo steel<br /><strong>Fork:</strong> Chopper steel         <br /><strong>Groupset:</strong> Three speed hub gear with top tube shift lever<br /><strong>Wheels:</strong> 16” front, 20” rear<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> Rim<br /><strong>Bars:</strong> Ape hanger, 520mm rise                                          <br /><strong>Saddle:</strong> Chopper sprung banana    <br /><strong>Sizes: </strong>37cm<br /><strong>Weight:</strong> 18.4kg                        <br /><strong>Colours:</strong> Ultra Violet, Infra Red          <br /><strong>Price: </strong>£950</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For more, go to <a href=\"https://www.raleigh.co.uk/gb/en/\" target=\"_blank\">raleigh.co.uk</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/raleigh-chopper-relaunch\">Raleigh returns to the 1970s with a relaunch of the Chopper</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0b02a088de2c51c59ff58856ee1532694306735f81b63fd13402536c812e2eed","category":"Cycling"}
