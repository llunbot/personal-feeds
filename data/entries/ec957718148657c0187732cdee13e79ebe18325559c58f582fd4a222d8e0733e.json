Instead of pointing to documents scattered across remote fringes of Sharepoint, we bring key insights together ‚Äî in one single place.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs explore a couple of <strong>helpful customer journey templates</strong> to get started and how companies use them in practice.</p>\n\n\n<p>This article is <strong>part of our ongoing series</strong> on <a href=\"/category/ux\">UX</a>.

However, it might need <strong>other lanes</strong> that would be more relevant for your team. For example, include relevant findings and recommendations from UX research. List key actions needed for the next stage. Include relevant UX metrics and unsuccessful touchpoints.</p>\n<p><strong>Whatever works for you</strong>, works for you ‚Äî just make sure to avoid assumptions and refer to facts and insights from research.</p>\nSpotify Customer Journey Map\n<p><a href=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/c1zhnszcah7h/6dlIZwMTFlRm07vH0fUquI/b21cc6c086ff01572ad2580c8d75dc31/Inline_-_Personas_2x__1_.png\">Spotify Customer Journey Blueprint</a> (high resolution) breaks down customer experiences by <strong>distinct user profiles</strong>, and for each includes mobile and desktop views, pain points, thoughts, and actions. Also, notice <strong>branches</strong> for customers who skip authentication or admin tasks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/customer-journey-maps-figma-miro-templates/2-spotify-customer-journey-blueprint.jpg\" /></p>\nGetting Started With Journey Maps\n<p>To <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/an-introduction-to-user-journey-map-pdf-templates/\">get started with user journey maps</a>, we first <strong>choose a lens</strong>: Are we reflecting the current state or projecting a future state? Then, we choose a <strong>customer who experiences the journey</strong> ‚Äî and we capture the situation/goals that they are focusing on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/customer-journey-maps-figma-miro-templates/3-practical-guide-customer-journey-mapping.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Next, we <strong>list high-level actions</strong> users are going through. We start by defining the first and last stages and fill in between. Don‚Äôt get too granular: list key actions needed for the next stage. Add the user‚Äôs thoughts, feelings, sentiments, and emotional curves.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/customer-journey-maps-figma-miro-templates/4-guide-customer-journey-mapping.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Eventually, add <strong>user‚Äôs key touchpoints with people, services, tools</strong>. Map user journey across mobile and desktop screens. Transfer insights from other research (e.g., customer support). Fill in stage after stage until the entire map is complete.</p>\n<p>Then, <strong>identify pain</strong> points and highlight them with red dots. Add relevant jobs-to-be-done, metrics, channels if needed. Attach links to quotes, photos, videos, prototypes, Figma files. Finally, explore ideas and opportunities to address pain points.</p>\nFree Customer Journey Maps Templates (Miro, Figma)\n<p>You don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel from scratch.

It‚Äôs in those moments when things leave a perfect path that a product‚Äôs UX is actually stress-tested.</p>\n<p>So consider mapping <strong>unsuccessful touchpoints</strong> as well ‚Äî failures, error messages, conflicts, incompatibilities, warnings, connectivity issues, eventual lock-outs and frequent log-outs, authentication issues, outages, and urgent support inquiries.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to <strong>question assumptions and biases early</strong>. Once they live in your UX map, they grow roots ‚Äî and it might not take long until they are seen as the foundation of everything, which can be remarkably difficult to challenge or question later.
