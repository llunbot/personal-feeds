The agency will convene <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html\">its advisory panel of vaccine experts</a> Wednesday to discuss the changes. Walensky is likely to sign off soon after.</p>\n<p>With the changes, the only mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines authorized and in use in the country will be the bivalent formulations from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which initially rolled out last fall. These vaccines target the ancestral COVID-19 strain and the omicron BA.4/5 subvariants.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932878#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932878&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3713378a5db4c3262084f29e095a876a1c063bd5bc0931551d3fd5dd1f3d7ac6","category":"Tech"}
