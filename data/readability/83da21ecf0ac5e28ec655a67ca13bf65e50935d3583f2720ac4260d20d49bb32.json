Sure. Did people get their thrills in antiquated ways? Definitely.</p><p>But were people also doing stupid shit without thought for safety, and absolutely zero OH&amp;S to speak of? <em>Absolutely.</em></p><p>Case in point: look at that maniac up top. From the evidence before us, he is wearing a sensible outfit and a nice little cap and does not have the obvious appearance of a man with a death-wish. And yet, here we are and there he is, going down the steps of the Capitol on a penny farthing with the little wheel at the front.</p><p>Although this picture was <a href=\"https://www.annenbergphotospace.org/exhibits/not-an-ostrich/\">most recently published in a 2018 photography book</a> titled ‘Not an Ostrich’ (fact check: true; he has no feathers), it was originally taken in 1884. Because of these factors, it is not the crispest jpeg you’re likely to encounter, and our guy’s face is more of a silhouette of where a face should be. Consequently, we can’t see the extent to which he is shitting himself, and those details are lost to the mists of time.</p><p>Maybe he had some sense that he had done something silly. Maybe he began to experience a deep existential regret the instant he set sail down the very long, very steep stairs. Maybe he broke his neck the second he went out of frame. Probably.</p><p>We don’t know everything there is to know about this cooked unit because the Library of Congress <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/ds.07962/\">does not have that information</a>. What we do know is that in 1884 a handsomely dressed man on a bike did something profoundly reckless, while a second handsome lunatic watched on, one fist balled handsomely on his waist. We do not know anything else about these men, but I promise you this:</p><p>They are both now dead. But when they lived, they were absolute madaxes.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/service-pnp-cph-3a30000-3a32000-3a32400-3a32443r.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now, here is another absolute maniac (deceased). We know a little more about him – he was a stuntperson with a stage name of Diavolo, although his real name was the much-less-arresting Conn Baker. He, too, had a bicycle and a death wish.</p><p>This picture, by G. Fred Matthiessen, captures him at the apex of his <em>piece de resistance</em>, which the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2011660995/\">Library of Congress describes drily</a> as “a loop and topsy turvy somersault”. His posters at the time were a bit more florid:</p><blockquote><p><em>The veritable cap-sheaf of all hazardous exploits!</em></p><p><em>The extreme and absolute limit of sensationalism reached at last. Beyond the tremendously terrible temerity and illimitable, inimitable intrepidity of Diavolo, no man may go.</em></p></blockquote><p>… which sure seems like a string of spicy statements that would get the people going in 1904.</p><p>Did Diavolo absolutely nail himself on this occasion? Maybe! We don’t know. We <em>do</em> know, however, that the same year, the Kingston Daily Freeman reported that Diavolo had – and I quote – “an off night” in which “his loop took on unexpected ‘English’ [and] he was diverted directly downward and into the net. The performer landed in the net as if ‘stunned or dead’, but the bicycle cut through and crashed to the ground.”</p><p>“A tense silence was followed by hysterical female cries,” the Daily Freeman writes, a bit sexistly, before noting that Diavolo woke up suddenly. To which, the report sexistly concludes, the “men cheered, but many of the women, some still hysterical, left the tent.”</p><p>Your move, Red Bull Rampage.</p><p>We press on …</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/service-pnp-npcc-01500-01561v.jpeg\"></figure><p>Here is another old-timey maniac. He is a sailor, he is called Tony Pizzo, and in 1919 he rode across America on a bicycle because he was dared to by the actor, Fatty Arbuckle, for a cool $3,500. At the completion of his journey in New York, Pizzo told the New York Times that he wouldn’t make the journey again for a million dollars.</p><p>I’m calling bullshit on the NYT’s reporting here, because months later, he rode from New York to Los Angeles <em>and back</em> for $5,000, which is conspicuously less than a mill even when you take inflation into account.</p><p>Astute observers will note that he is handcuffed to his bike. This is, the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/npcc.01561/\">Library of Congress tells us</a>, part of Pizzo’s whole schtick: “The Handcuffs were sealed by Mayor Hylan in New York April 24th and are not to be opened until his return to that city.”</p><p>Pizzo – and Arbuckle, and Handcuffs Hylan – are now, obviously, long dead. But hey, it’s fun to imagine a time when any of this seemed like a good idea.</p><p>We will round out this article with four <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/09/the-length-of-suffering-a-gravel-riders-unlikely-pursuit-record/\">Ashton Lambies</a> (c. 1898) riding nowhere in a hurry:</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/service-pnp-cph-3b30000-3b39000-3b39800-3b39889r.jpeg\"></figure><p>I don’t know who was going out of their way to buy the bike advertised here, but it was a different era.</p><p>In the lifespan of these gents, they could have – if they were fortunate enough – watched a maniac go down the stairs of the Library of Congress on a backwards penny farthing; seen another maniac in a devil costume absolutely poleaxe himself on a loop-the-loop; pose unsmilingly on a bicycle made for four; and watched a harrowed Tony Pizzo glide by in handcuffs.</p><p>What a time to be alive.</p><p>As for the models: they are, inevitably, now all deceased. Prior to crossing that final finish line, however, I trust that they had rich fulfilling lives flexing their quads on the OrientQuad.</p><p>Thank you, Library of Congress Public Domain images.
