The latest group to see cuts is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/18/google-cuts-dozens-of-jobs-in-news-division-.html\">Google's news division</a>, which CNBC's Jennifer Elias reports is losing an estimated 40â€“45 jobs, according to an Alphabet Workers Union spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Google News is one of the biggest drivers of traffic on the Internet, thanks to spots at the very top of Google Search results, on the Chrome mobile new tab page, in the Google search app, on some Android home screens, and on the news.google.com home page. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2023/09/our-new-ladapo-scale-rates-misinformation-merchants/\">Online misinformation</a> is surging, and between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas, worldwide regulators are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/eu-warns-musk-of-penalties-if-x-doesnt-stop-israel-hamas-disinformation/\">cracking down</a> on news sites spreading false information. Usually, Google's content concern from regulators revolves around YouTube, but now Google seemingly has fewer people to deal with misinformation in one of its biggest content-promotion divisions.</p>\n<p>A Google spokesperson told CNBC there's nothing to worry about, saying, \"These internal changes have no impact on our misinformation and information quality work in News.\" A staff engineer at Google News had a different take on the layoffs, though, posting on LinkedIn, \"Today Google laid off a bunch of workers who worked on Google News. These are some of the best and brightest people I've ever worked with, and frankly, I don't expect the calculus behind this decision will ever make sense to me. We're definitely worse off without them.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977245#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977245&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3bfd0a39852e03f7ba26f531f092689ccc67c7552e47d0f3dff429852d60a6f1","category":"Tech"}
