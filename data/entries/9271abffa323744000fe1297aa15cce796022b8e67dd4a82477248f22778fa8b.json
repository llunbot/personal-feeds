{"title":"Apple Releases Fourth Betas of iOS 18.2 and More With Genmoji, Image Playground and ChatGPT Integration","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/apple-ios-18-2-fourth-beta/","date":1732125919000,"content":"Apple today seeded the fourth betas of upcoming iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, a week after releasing the third betas. Alongside the fourth betas of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac operating system updates, Apple has also seeded the third beta of watchOS 11.2. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Generic-iOS-18.2-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWith today's updates, Apple is continuing to test the next phase of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, with these features available for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS:\r<br />\n<h2>Image Playground</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a> is Apple's image generation app, and it can create images based on prompts. You can enter a description of what you want or use the built-in suggestions and concepts that Apple provides. Apple will suggest costumes, locations, items, and more to add to an image, and these concepts are intelligent and can draw inspiration from a Messages thread or content in the Notes app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are options to create characters that resemble your friends and family, and you can choose a photo for ‌Image Playground‌ to use as inspiration to create a related image. Elements added to ‌Image Playground‌ creations are previewed, and there is a preview history so you can undo a change and go back to a prior version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile ‌Image Playground‌ is a standalone app, it is also integrated into Messages. ‌Image Playground‌ does not make photorealistic images and is instead limited to animation or illustration styles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Image Wand</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-wand/\">Image Wand</a> is an Image Playground-related feature that's available in the Notes app on ‌iPad‌. You can draw a rough sketch with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> or circle a blank space or a key phrase in a note to have ‌Image Wand‌ generate an appropriate image.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Genmoji</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> are custom emoji characters that you can create based on descriptions and phrases. Like ‌Image Playground‌ creations, you can base them on your friends and family, with the data pulled from the People album in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>. You can also make characters using basic elements, and you'll get multiple ‌Genmoji‌ suggestions to choose from. You can create ‌Genmoji‌ using the emoji keyboard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Genmoji‌ were limited to iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 as of the second betas, but will be coming to ‌macOS Sequoia‌.\r<br />\n<h2>Siri ChatGPT Integration</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> can integrate with ChatGPT for certain requests, but only with user approval. If ‌Siri‌ is unable to provide an answer to a query, ‌Siri‌ will hand the request over to ChatGPT. ChatGPT's answer will then be provided by ‌Siri‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChatGPT can be used to create content from scratch, including text and images. No account is required to use ChatGPT integration, and Apple and OpenAI do not store requests.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Visual Intelligence</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> users have access to Visual Intelligence, a feature that provides information about what's around you. If you open the camera and point it at a restaurant, for example, you'll see opening hours and reviews.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome other Visual Intelligence capabilities include reading text out loud, detecting phone numbers and addresses to add them to Contacts, copying text, and summarizing text. There is an option to search Google for where to buy a specific item that you see, and you can also point the camera at something and then get more information about it from ChatGPT.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to expand this feature to include more functionality over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Writing Tools</h2>\r<br />\nApple is enhancing the Writing Tools feature to add an option to make more open-ended changes. In iOS 18.1 and its sister updates, Writing Tools can only be used to change the tone to friendly, professional, and a more simplified version. In iOS 18.2, you can describe the tone or content change that you want to make, such as adding more action words, or turning an email into a poem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Languages</h2>\r<br />\n‌Apple Intelligence‌ has gained support for localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and the U.K., in addition to U.S. English.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wait List</h2>\r<br />\nIf you've already been testing ‌Apple Intelligence‌ and are opted in, you will have access to Writing Tools, ChatGPT integration, and Visual Intelligence automatically.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a secondary waiting list for early access to use ‌Genmoji‌, ‌Image Playground‌, and ‌Image Wand‌. You can sign up to get access in ‌Image Playground‌ or in the areas where you access ‌Genmoji‌ or ‌Image Wand‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen you request access, you are added to a wait list for all three capabilities and you'll get a notification when the features are available for you to use. Apple is rolling out access to the new image generation features over the coming weeks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Availability and Compatibility</h2>\r<br />\nThe iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2 are available on all devices, but the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features require a device capable of ‌Apple Intelligence‌. Apple is still working on refining the new ‌Apple Intelligence‌ tools, and the company warns that ‌Genmoji‌, ‌Image Wand‌, and ‌Image Playground‌ can sometimes give you results you weren't expecting. Apple is collecting feedback on these experiences and will refine them over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple Intelligence‌ requires an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro or any ‌iPhone 16‌ model, an ‌iPad‌ with an M-series chip or an A17 Pro chip, or a Mac with an M-series chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2, watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2, and visionOS 2.2 updates in early December.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/apple-ios-18-2-fourth-beta/\">Apple Releases Fourth Betas of iOS 18.2 and More With Genmoji, Image Playground and ChatGPT Integration</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-fourth-betas-of-ios-18-2-and-more-with-genmoji-image-playground-and-chatgpt-integration.2443555/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9271abffa323744000fe1297aa15cce796022b8e67dd4a82477248f22778fa8b","category":"Apple"}
