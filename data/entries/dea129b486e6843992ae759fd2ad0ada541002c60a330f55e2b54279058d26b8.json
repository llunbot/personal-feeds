We saw it on sensors everywhere, from the Arctic to Antarctica.</p>\n<p>We were baffled—the signal was unlike any previously recorded. Instead of the frequency-rich rumble typical of earthquakes, this was a monotonous hum, containing only a single vibration frequency. Even more puzzling was that the signal kept going for nine days.</p>\n<p>Initially classified as a “USO”—an unidentified seismic object—the source of the signal was eventually traced back to a massive landslide in Greenland’s remote Dickson Fjord. A staggering volume of rock and ice, enough to fill 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, plunged into the fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high mega-tsunami and a phenomenon known as a seiche: a wave in the icy fjord that continued to slosh back and forth, some 10,000 times over nine days.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049682#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049682&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dea129b486e6843992ae759fd2ad0ada541002c60a330f55e2b54279058d26b8","category":"Tech"}
