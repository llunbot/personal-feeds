After my umpteenth time\n  passing the billboard, while trying to distract myself from the\n  single-digit temperatures and the brutal wind chill, I realized\n  what I’d been missing. That’s not just a basketball-playing\n  <s>foul</s> fowl.\n  &gt;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You see, the Last Tenement is located just a few hundred feet from\nTD Garden, home arena for the <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2024/06/18/by-the-numbers-the-celtics-2024-championship/\">reigning NBA champion</a>\nBoston Celtics. The Celtics have had many <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2022/08/01/far-more-than-a-great-basketball-player/\">great players</a>\nover the years, but only one had the last name “Bird”.
