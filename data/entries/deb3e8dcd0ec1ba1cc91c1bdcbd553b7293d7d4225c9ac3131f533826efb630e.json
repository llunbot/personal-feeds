Its latest release, however, the Pinarello Dogma X, is a bike that the Italian brand says has not been designed with professional riders in mind. Instead, it places a focus on endurance road riding and, according to Pinarello, “unparalleled ride quality and ground-breaking technology which allow it to excel in everyday life.”</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The Dogma X has been designed with Pinarello’s Endurance geometry, which aims to strike a balance between high-performance and comfort – it offers a more aero position than the brand’s Endurance+ geometry but it is not as aggressive as a pure race machine. Pinarello has made conscious design choices to make the Dogma X suitable for the everyday rider, namely increased tyre clearance (35mm) and unique-looking \"X-STAYS\" at the rear of the bike which Pinarello says should absorb vibrations without sacrificing frame weight or bottom bracket stiffness.<img alt src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Social_Post-8972_RB_220623_phRobyBragotto_Pinarello_X_Toscana_1024x1024.jpg?v=1695303727\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>The seat stays feature a reduced diameter in the curved top with the aim of dampening vibrations and increasing lateral stiffness at the same time to compensate for the elongation of the chain stays. Pinarello says that the double attachment points disperse the forces onto two parts of the seat tube which should reduce vibration transfer on a rider’s back. The aim of the Dogma X is comfort while keeping the bike at a low weight and rolling fast.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the launch of the new Dogma X, Pinarello says it has continued to collaborate with “the world’s leading carbon fibre producer” Toray, to create a frame that strikes the perfect balance between weight and stiffness. The Dogma X features T110 1K carbon fibre. </span></p>\n<p><span>The bike also carries forward Pinarello’s asymmetric ethos, whereby frames are asymmetrically designed to balance the greater torsional forces imparted by the chain, with the end goal of providing riders with a perfectly symmetrical ride.<img alt src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Social_Post-8228_RB_210623_phRobyBragotto_Pinarello_X_Toscana_1024x1024.jpg?v=1695303812\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>The new Dogma X comes in four colour combinations and can also be customised through Pinarello’s MYWAY platform which allows riders to create their own paint design. The bike can be specced with Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 (with or without a power meter), SRAM Red AXS or Campagnolo Super Record EPS. The wheel options are Princeton Grit 4540, BORA WTO 33 or DT Swiss ERC 1400. </span></p>\n<p><span>A Pinarello Dogma X with  <span>Princeton Grit 4540 wheels, Talon Ultra Light Handlebars and Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 with a power meter retails for £13,300. The Dogma X frameset is £5,500.</span></span></p>\n<h3>\n<span></span>Expansion of the Pinarello X Series range</h3>\n<p><span>Alongside the launch of the Dogma, Pinarello has also announced additions to its X Series range, which Pinarello says is made up of models for “fun rides and all-day comfort”. The first bikes in the series were <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/desire-journal/pinarello-launches-new-f-series-and-x-series-bikes\">launched in February this year</a> with the X3 and the X1 and the latest update sees the addition of X9, X7 and X5 models.</span></p>\n<p><span>Pinarello says the new frames in the series have been designed specifically with modern tubeless tyres and wide wheel-rim technology in mind with the aim of creating “a new kind of endurance frame that doesn’t have to compromise performance over comfort”. The bikes feature Pinarello’s Flexi-stay 2.0 which should absorb vibrations with two different carbon fibre layups (T900 and T700) and – like on the Dogma X – a slimmer diameter in the curved top stays and the dual attachment to the frame. As on the Dogma X, bikes in the X Series come with 35mm tyres for additional comfort.<img alt src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Social_Post-6007_RB_180623_phRobyBragotto_Pinarello_X_Dolomiti_1024x1024.jpg?v=1695303840\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>The X Series frames feature Pinarello’s popular Endurance+ geometry which has been seen on the brand’s X3/1 and Paris models in the past. This means that the bike features a higher stack and a more compact reach, allowing riders to have a relaxed riding position. Pinarello says that this also means that bike fitters can accurately fit all kinds of cyclists to the X Series without resorting to excessive use of spacers or up-sizing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Like for the Dogma X, the carbon fibre on the X series frames is a product of Pinarello’s collaboration with Toray. The X9 and X7 models feature </span><span>T900 which Pinarello says “blends performance, lightness, and vibration mitigation”. The X5 features T700 which is all about “prioritising maximum vibration absorption with minimal weight increase”. Like all of Pinarello’s bikes, the X Series models feature an asymmetrical design.</span></p>\n<p><span>All three of the X9, X7 and X5 bikes come with Most Ultrafast 40 wheels, while the X5 can also be specced with a Fulcrum Racing 800 DB wheelset. The X9 comes with either Shimano Dura Ace Di2 or SRAM Red Etap AXS and is available in a gold and black colourway. The X7 is available in two colours, red and black or navy and black, and can be specced with Shimano Ultegra Di2 or SRAM Force Etap AXS. The X5 comes in either white or black and is available with Shimano 105 Di2. </span></p>\n<p><span>A Pinarello X7 with Shimano Ultegra Di2, Most Carbon Ultrafast wheels and Talon Ultra Light handlebars is priced at £7,200. A Pinarello X5 with Shimano 105 Di2, Fulcrum Racing 800 wheels and an Alloy two piece handlebar is priced at £5,700. The Pinarello X9 with Shimano Dura-Ace Di2, Shimano C50 wheels and Talon Ultralight handlebars retails for  <span>$11,800/€11,900 (this model is not available in the UK.)</span></span></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"deb3e8dcd0ec1ba1cc91c1bdcbd553b7293d7d4225c9ac3131f533826efb630e","category":"Cycling"}
