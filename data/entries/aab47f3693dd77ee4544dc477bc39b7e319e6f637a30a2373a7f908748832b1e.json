Given all those earlier demos that went nowhere, I wasn't particularly enthused when I heard that BMW and Valeo were demonstrating yet another implementation of a car parking itself for the 2024 CES in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>However, after a quick chat with the folks behind the technology and getting a chance to try it myself, I realized I was wrong. Remote Valet is impressive not only for what it can do but because it does it without any technology more advanced than what's already found in today's production cars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995592#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995592&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aab47f3693dd77ee4544dc477bc39b7e319e6f637a30a2373a7f908748832b1e","category":"Tech"}
