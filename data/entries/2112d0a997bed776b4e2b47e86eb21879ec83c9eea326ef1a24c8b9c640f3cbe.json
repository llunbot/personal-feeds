Hold. Hold,\" a member of Atlas V launch team called out on an audio feed.</p>\n<p>With the hold, the mission missed an instantaneous launch opportunity at 12:25 pm EDT (16:25 UTC), and later Saturday, NASA announced teams will forego a launch opportunity Sunday. The next chance to send Starliner into orbit will be 10:52 am EDT (14:52 UTC) Wednesday. The mission has one launch opportunity every one-to-two days, when the International Space Station's orbital track moves back into proper alignment with the Atlas V rocket's launch pad in Florida.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028368#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028368&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2112d0a997bed776b4e2b47e86eb21879ec83c9eea326ef1a24c8b9c640f3cbe","category":"Tech"}
