Cycling gets me from A to B and it keeps me fit, healthy and happy, but even more importantly it makes me </span><i><span>feel</span></i><span>. Our latest magazine, </span><i><span>Rouleur 119: the Soul issue</span></i><span> explores all the ways that cycling elevates our spirits, lifts our mood and enhances our interaction with the world.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>When we brainstormed ideas for issue themes through 2023, we had already committed to making </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/products/issue-116-mind\"><i><span>Rouleur 116</span></i></a><span> at the end of 2022 our ‘Mind’ issue. We quickly decided that ‘<a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/products/issue-117-the-body-issue\">Body’ (</a></span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/products/issue-117-the-body-issue\"><i><span>Rouleur 117)</span></i></a><span> would be our first magazine of 2023. And we couldn’t have ‘Mind’ and ‘Body’ editions without a ‘Soul’ magazine to complete the trinity.</span></p>\n<p><span>The funny thing is, nobody really knows what a soul is. Philosophers and scientists have for over four thousand years pondered the existence of the soul. Where is it? What is it? Classical philosophers theorised that it resided in the liver; Aristotle proclaimed that it was in the heart (getting closer now); Plato and Pythagoras suggested the brain was the seat of the soul. Herophilus, a more detail-focused and specific kind of philosopher, posited that the soul was exactly in the fourth ventricle of the brain. Even so, René Descartes concluded centuries later that the soul and the body were separate things. Basically, we haven’t got a clue. But at the same time, we know exactly what a soul is. That feeling you have when riding a bike or immersing yourself in a bike race? That’s the wave we’re riding in this edition of the magazine.</span></p>\n<p><span>So what’s in the mag? Our resident photojournalist James Startt pinned down man of the moment Remco Evenepoel for an interview and photoshoot earlier in the year to run in this magazine, the publication of which happily coincides with the start of the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia?_gl=1*1o846vy*_ga*NjM2MDk2NDIzLjE2ODMxODQwNTQ.*_ga_Y44TH4HXBV*MTY4MzI3NTY0Ny4yLjEuMTY4MzI3NjA1Ni4wLjAuMA..\">Giro d’Italia</a>, a race in which Evenepoel is the overwhelming favourite to win. As journalists we love Evenepoel. Obviously, he’s a generational talent and a highly gifted rider who has won Liège-Bastogne-Liège twice, plus a Vuelta and World title in the last year alone, but he also has huge charisma and rough edges, which manifest themselves in occasional directness in interviews and which make him all the more compelling as a human being. He gave James some memorable quotes, with refreshing honesty and self-analysis, and looked ahead to the Giro, a race he obviously has a lot of respect for.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/the-rouleur-newsletter\"><em><strong>Sign up to our Giro d'Italia newsletter to receive exclusive articles that go beyond the race report</strong></em></a></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/119_close_up_by_Alessandra_Bucci.jpg?v=1683276316\" alt /><span>We’ve not just focused on the racing in our ‘Soul’ mag. Last year, I got a pitch from photojournalist Ryan Le Garrec, who told me of a solo bikepacking trip he was taking from his home in Lisbon to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. It sounded like quite the adventure, but Ryan came up with something extremely original, through both his account of the trip and a happy accident with his cameras. His feature </span><i><span>Crossing the Divide</span></i><span> is an impressionistic account of his journey, but the first thing that struck me about it was the fact that it wasn’t in chronological order. Normally when we run bikepacking features, we follow the journey from the start, through the middle and to the end. But Ryan had arranged his memories according to how they had made an impression on him, in much the same way that we’ll remember the high points and memorable moments of a particular holiday years later, not the day-to-day order of the trip. That gave the piece an entirely different pace, and allowed the important things to float to the surface, rather than be bound by the order in which they happened. Ryan also dropped his camera, and it stuck on the black and white setting, which was initially a worry, but he realised that the harsh contrast of the lighting in his pictures were reflecting his own state of mind as he journeyed through Morocco. Yes, there was beauty there, but travelling can also be a challenging, lonely experience, and that also came across in the pictures. If you’re still wondering what I mean when I say cycling is about soul, read </span><i><span>Crossing the Divide</span></i><span>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Our friend and contributor Jeremy Whittle also gave us a brilliant set of interviews in his piece </span><i><span>Cycling, Spirituality and Escape</span></i><span>. The idea here was to present a series of interviews and portraits of prominent public figures who had each experienced challenges in one form or another, and found in cycling a way of finding solace and space to reflect. Jeremy spoke to Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former Director of Communications, Radio 2 DJ OJ Borg, bestselling novelist Freya North, Lance Armstrong’s former soigneur Emma O’Reilly and EVO Fitness founder Nick Evans. Each of the interviews is revealing and honest, accompanied by brilliant portraits shot by Véronique Rolland. And it’s interesting to observe that while the common theme between these five individuals is a certain level of fame, challenging circumstances and cycling as a way of helping themselves, they sometimes go about it in entirely different ways. For O’Reilly and North, it’s enough to cycle and they have no interest in how fast they ride; but OJ Borg LOVES to hammer himself. Borg needs to know exactly where he’s going and for how long; Campbell just goes where the road takes him. In short: do whatever makes you happy.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/119_close_up_by_Alessandra_Bucci_-8215.jpg?v=1683276387\" alt /><span>James Startt also came up with a unique feature for </span><i><span>Rouleur 119</span></i><span>, which was an interview with Enzo Staiola, in </span><i><span>A Face Full Of Expression.</span></i><span> Staiola was a child actor plucked from obscurity on the streets of Rome by movie director Vittoria De Sica for his seminal </span><i><span>Bicycle Thieves</span></i><span>, filmed in 1948 and winner of the Best Foreign Film category at the 1950 Oscars. </span><i><span>Bicycle Thieves</span></i><span>, in which the bike takes centre stage, is a classic of neorealism, which portrayed life as it really was, with no filters, and its entire cast were ordinary people, rather than trained actors. Staiola is now in his 80s, and while there may be six degrees of Kevin Bacon, there are only two degrees of Enzo Staiola: Valerio Coladonato, a friend of James who is a film studies professor, happens to live in the same apartment block as Staiola in Rome. He put them in touch, and the result is this beautiful and touching feature about a long life, well lived.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Also in the magazine: Rachel Jary’s insightful and revealing interview with Victoria Pendleton; </span><i><span>Romancing the Old, </span></i><span>by Guy Dixon, which looks at the intimate and meaningful relationship we have with the era in which we got into cycling - in this case the 1980s; Maria David speaks with Selam Amha Gerefiel, an Ethiopian cyclist based at the World Cycling Centre in Aigle; </span><i><span>The Soul of Bike Racing</span></i><span>, which explores the deeper meaning of bike racing, beyond just bike racing; we speak with former pro Dan Craven about his Onguza bike company, which oozes soul – he is in Namibia, training local workers to build frames but also confidence; Art Cycle looks at Picasso’s </span><i><span>Bull’s Head</span></i><span>; Velocio’s Unity jersey, featuring interviews with Beau Marksohn, Jack Thompson, Jana Streich, Björn Lexius and Åshild Tovsrud; Rachel Jary reports back from her experience at Strade Bianche with the new Enough Cycling team; I dive into the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi in a feature about riding in Japan; and much, much more.</span></p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\"><i>Rouleur 119: the Soul Issue</i> is now available from rouleur.cc.</a></strong><span><br /></span>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"cb2619f0ddea15b13ff5bc05f41bc32f9e1b18e88df77c6b059cbc71213f48ce","category":"Cycling"}
