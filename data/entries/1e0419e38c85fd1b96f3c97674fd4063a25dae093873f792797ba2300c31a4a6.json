{"title":"The End of the Line for Delicious Library","link":"https://mastodon.social/@wjs/113539330521476328","date":1732677034000,"content":"\n<p>Wil Shipley, on Mastodon:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Amazon has shut off the feed that allowed Delicious Library to\nlook up items, unfortunately limiting the app to what users\nalready have (or enter manually).</p>\n\n<p>I wasn’t contacted about this.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve pulled it from the Mac App Store and shut down the website so\nnobody accidentally buys a non-functional app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The end of an era, but it’s kind of surprising it was still functional until now. (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilshipley/\">Shipley has been a full-time engineer at Apple</a> for three years now.)</p>\n\n<p>It’s hard to describe just what a sensation Delicious Library was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130429014759/http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2005/01/66276\">when it debuted</a>, and <a href=\"https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/the-delicious-generation/\">how influential it was</a>. Delicious Library was simultaneously very useful, in very practical ways, and obsessed with its exuberant UI in ways that served no purpose other than looking cool as shit. It was an app that demanded to be praised just for the way it looked, but also served a purpose that resonated with many users. For about a decade it seemed as though most popular new apps would be designed like Delicious Library. Then Apple dropped iOS 7 in 2013, and now, no apps look like this. Whatever it is that we, as an industry, have lost in the now decade-long trend of iOS 7-style flat design, Delicious Library epitomized it.</p>\n\n<p>They were even clever and innovative <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2006/06/26/delicious-gamblers\">in the ways they promoted the app</a>. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2008/12/delicious_library_2.php\">The first time</a> Delicious Monster sponsored Daring Fireball for a week, their sponsorship message read, in its entirety:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Organize the shit you like. <br />\nGet rid of the shit you don’t. <br />\nDelicious Library 2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When they created an iPhone version of Delicious Library, they announced it via <a href=\"https://lonelysandwich.com/post/122013190/delicious-video\">this delightfully intricate but decidedly lo-fi stop-motion-animated video</a>.</p>\n\n<p>20 years go by and there’s some inevitable nostalgia looking back at any art form. But man, Delicious Library exemplified an era of indie app development that, sadly, is largely over. And make no bones about it: Delicious Library was a creative work of art.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/delicious-library-eol\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1e0419e38c85fd1b96f3c97674fd4063a25dae093873f792797ba2300c31a4a6","category":"Tech"}
