This would be a departure from past Snapdragon chips for PCs, which have performed worse than (or, at best, similarly to) existing Intel options, barely improved battery life, and come with a bunch of software incompatibility problems to boot.</p>\n<p>Early benchmarks that have trickled out look promising for the Snapdragon X. And there are other reasons to be optimistic—the Snapdragon X Elite’s design team is headed up by some of the same people who made Apple Silicon so successful in the first place.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015658#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015658&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10e9cbf4e4a05656e96619203322a1edcbda753ab2e70bd6b898ae0cc9201307","category":"Tech"}
