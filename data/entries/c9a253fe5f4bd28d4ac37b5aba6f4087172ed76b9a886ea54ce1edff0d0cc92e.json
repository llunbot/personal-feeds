So, instead they decided to create their own Monterey landscape, but finding the right shot came with its own problems, as their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8c4B5CxP_k\">intrepid video diary</a> explains. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nAfter several false starts, the group eventually found an ideal location in Monterey, and, using time-lapse photography, were able to create a not only a still image but also a dynamic wallpaper that changes according to the time of day. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/macOS-Monterey-missing-wallpaper.jpg\" /><div><em>\"Missing\" Monterey Dynamic Wallpaper</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThey have since made both the <a href=\"https://www.vyncher.com/s/Lone-Cypress-Sunset-alt-5K.jpg\">still shot</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0da69co3f5ndnnv/AABun_JC1-tz0f64M3iNX7HQa?dl=0\">dynamic version</a> available to download.
