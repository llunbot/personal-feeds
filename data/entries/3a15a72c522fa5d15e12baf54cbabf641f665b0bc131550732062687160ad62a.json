{"title":"Kirk McElhearn: ‘Apple Music Classical (Mostly) Plays the Right Chords’","link":"https://tidbits.com/2023/03/29/apple-music-classical-mostly-plays-the-right-chords/","date":1680981149000,"content":"\n<p>Kirk McElhearn has a comprehensive review of the new Apple Music Classical app/catalog at TidBITS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Due to the way classical works have been cataloged over time, many\nof their names are unique, at least for the most famous composers.\nSchubert’s compositions are <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schubert_Thematic_Catalogue\">cataloged according to the work of\nOtto Erich Deutsch</a>, hence the D before work numbers. Bach’s\nworks have BWV numbers, for <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\">Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, or Bach works\ncatalog</a>. For other composers, opus numbers are used,\nreferring to a specific publication. So for Beethoven, we have Op.\n26: Piano Sonata No. 12 in A♭ major, which is a single piano\nsonata, and Op. 27, which contains two piano sonatas, No. 1: Piano\nSonata No. 13 in E♭ major, and No. 2: Piano Sonata No. 14 in C♯\nminor, also known as the Moonlight Sonata.</p>\n\n<p>The point of this somewhat lengthy preamble is to explain why\nsearching for classical music is so much more complicated than\nsearching for popular music. You may want to listen to a specific\nwork by a given composer, but also by one of your favorite\nperformers. And, as you can see with the example of the Schubert\nsonata, work names are not always as simple as Bach’s Goldberg\nVariations. Metadata is the key to managing classical music.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve seen some people wondering if Apple Music Classical is the first step toward per-genre apps: Apple Music Rock, Apple Music Rap, Apple Music Jazz, etc. That’s almost certainly not going to happen. Classical music is different, because it doesn’t fit in the simple categorization of artist → album → song. Classical music demands different and more metadata attached to the music, <em>and</em> a different interface for browsing, discovering, and managing that music.</p>\n\n<p>One seemingly weird thing about Apple Music Classical: it’s iPhone-only for now. McElhearn writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It also seems like it should be trivial to add Apple Music\nClassical to the Music app on the desktop. Adding a sidebar entry\nwould not change the interface much, and since all of the content\nin the Apple Music Classical app is HTML, the Music app would have\nno problem displaying it. It’s the exact same type of content that\nApple Music uses.</p>\n\n<p>All this makes the Apple Music Classical app seem like an\nexperiment. It’s quite polished for a 1.0 release, and, despite\nthe issues that I’ve mentioned above that will irritate classical\nmusic fans, it’s a generally successful attempt to provide a\nbetter way to access classical music. Apple should be praised for\npaying so much attention to a genre that represents only 2–3% of\nthe overall music market.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/08/mcelhearn-apple-music-classical\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3a15a72c522fa5d15e12baf54cbabf641f665b0bc131550732062687160ad62a","category":"Tech"}
