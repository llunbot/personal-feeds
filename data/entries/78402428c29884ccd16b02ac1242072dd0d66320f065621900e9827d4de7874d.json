An <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/101o366/creating_an_indie_game_company_to_publish_a_game/\">anonymous developer</a> going by the Reddit handle potterharry97 reports having a Steam game page submission rejected for the use of \"art assets generated by artificial intelligence that appears to be relying on copyrighted material owned by third parties.\"</p>\n<p>Potterharry97 originally posted about the rejection in a May post on the now-private GameDev subreddit (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230511031304/https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/13cce1y/game_rejected_for_ai_generated_assets/\">partially archived here</a>, <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fgamedev%2Fcomments%2F13cce1y%2Fgame_rejected_for_ai_generated_assets%2F&amp;oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fgamedev%2Fcomments%2F13cce1y%2Fgame_rejected_for_ai_generated_assets%2F&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg60gEIMjk1M2owajSoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Google Cache here</a>). In that post, potterharry97 admitted that \"a large portion of the assets have some AI involvement in its creation\" through the use of Stable Diffusion. In <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/142j3yt/valve_is_not_willing_to_publish_games_with_ai/\">a follow-up post this month</a> on the AIGameDev subreddit, potterharry97 wrote that the initial submission was intended as an early placeholder version, \"with 2-3 assets/sprites that were admittedly obviously AI generated from the hands.\"</p>\n<p>That \"obvious\" use of AI art tools apparently set off some alarm bells with a Valve moderator, who reportedly replied that Valve had \"identified intellectual property... which appears to belongs to one or more third parties. In particular, [Game Name Here] contains art assets generated by artificial intelligence that appears to be relying on copyrighted material owned by third parties.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950944#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950944&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78402428c29884ccd16b02ac1242072dd0d66320f065621900e9827d4de7874d","category":"Tech"}
