Available in three sizes – 16, 20, and 24 inch – they’re sized for kids that haven’t grown into a 26″ wheeled DJ bike yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frames are lightweight aluminum and get air suspension forks with adjustable compression &amp; rebound settings, even on the 16″ model.  That helps take them beyond pump tracks into proper jump lines, where the launches get bigger and a little cushion helps as they learn to time landings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1.jpg\" alt=\"prevelo bravo kids dirt jump bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-prevelo-bravo-kids-dirt-jump-pump-track-bikes-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheels have Novatec hubs with WTB rims and Kenda Booster 2.2″ tires, and drivetrains are singlespeed with 28-tooth narrow-wide chainrings.
