Then he ordered two\ngin-and-tonics at the same time for himself. To be polite, I\nordered one, too. But it was so strong I couldn’t drink it, so I\nordered coffee. Then he had a third gin-and-tonic. I don’t know\nhow he could pass a security clearance. But they’re trying to\ncreate a culture where whistle-blowers are uncomfortable coming\nforward.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Until now, most American would have agreed that the secretary of defense ought not imbibe <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/bill-clinton-boris-yeltsin-drunk-1994-russian-state-visit\">like the president of Russia on a state visit to Washington</a>. A new wrinkle for the 2.0 kakistocracy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/breakfast-with-pete-hegseth\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5464a8f0157ac72fdc68e22de6a177ded56f0837e730cb92a20c645881b604ef","category":"Tech"}
