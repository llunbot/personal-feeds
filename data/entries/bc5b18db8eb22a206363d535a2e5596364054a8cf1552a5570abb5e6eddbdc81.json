Cook said that the return date is \"yet to be determined\" at this time. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple executives have made it clear since the beginning of the pandemic that employees will eventually need to return work. \"Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate,\" Cook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-employees-returning-to-work/\">said back in June</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen it is safe for employees to return to the office, Apple is planning for a hybrid work schedule. Employees will be expected to be in the office three days a week, but will have the option of working from home for two days a week. Apple also plans to allow employees to work remotely for up to one month per year, giving them more time to travel and be closer to loved ones. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBecause employees will need to continue to work from home, Cook said that Apple is giving every corporate employee $1,000 to spend on home office equipment. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-delays-corporate-return-to-offices/\">Apple Delays Corporate Return to Offices Indefinitely</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-delays-corporate-return-to-offices-indefinitely.2327773/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=d7buWDTokSQ:58-L-5Rlp78:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=d7buWDTokSQ:58-L-5Rlp78:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc5b18db8eb22a206363d535a2e5596364054a8cf1552a5570abb5e6eddbdc81","category":"Apple"}
