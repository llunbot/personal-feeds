But in recent years its cars have been left behind by rivals when it comes to fuel efficiency. As a small automaker facing daunting development costs, it decided to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/toyota-and-mazda-join-forces-to-built-1-6-billion-factory-in-the-us/\">partner</a> with Toyota on advanced technologies, including a battery electric vehicle <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/mazda-not-ready-to-bet-on-evs-but-says-more-plug-ins-for-the-us-market/\">due by 2027</a>. A more immediate benefit has been access to Toyota's hybrid powertrains, one of which can now be found inside the $33,970 2025 Mazda CX-50 Hybrid, which we've driven ahead of it going on sale this month.</p>\n<h2>Engineering stuff</h2>\n<p>Open the hood, and instead of one of Mazda's Skyactiv engines, you find one of Toyota's 2.5 L naturally aspirated Atkinson cycle engines, which drives the front wheels together with two electric motors (one is really the integrated starter motor) via a continuously variable transmission. At the rear, a third electric motor powers the rear wheels when necessary. The front traction motor provides 118 hp (88 kW), the rear motor can add an extra 54 hp (40 kW), and total output is rated at 219 hp (163 kW) and 163 ft-lb (220 Nm).</p>\n<figure>\n      <img width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-640x480.jpg\" alt=\"A Madza CX-50 from the rear\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-980x735.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-5-1440x1080.jpg 1440w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      It's a handsomely styled vehicle.\n\n              <span>\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Jonathan Gitlin\n\n                  </span>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n      <figure>\n      <img width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-640x480.jpg\" alt=\"A Madza CX-50 head-on\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-980x735.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Mazda-CX-50-Hybrid-2-1440x1080.jpg 1440w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Starting at under $34,000, the base CX-50 is very well-equipped.\n\n              <span>\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Jonathan Gitlin\n\n                  </span>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  \n<p>It wasn't exactly a case of shoehorning the new powertrain into the CX-50, but Mazda has had to modify the front frame rails to fit the new engine, transmission, and hybrid motors, and there's a new rear subframe with the rear eAxle, as well as the 0.9 kWh hybrid traction battery, which lives under the rear seat.
