Lee Sun-kyun, who played Park Dong-Ik in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)\">Bong Joon-ho's film</a>, plays a brilliant brain surgeon who seeks to find out the truth about the tragic accident that befell his wife and son.</p>\n<p>This is the first Apple TV+ series filmed completely in Korean, and its release coincides with the official launch of the streaming service in South Korea. Written and directed by Kim Jee-woon (<em>A Tale of Two Sisters</em>,<em> I Saw the Devil</em>), the new six-episode live-action series is based on the popular Korean webtoon of the same name by Hongjacga. Most Americans are probably unfamiliar with the source material, but South Korean programming has proved to be quite popular in the US, as evidenced by Netflix series like zombie period drama <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/review-kingdom-is-better-and-more-relevant-than-ever-in-s2/\"><em>Kingdom</em></a> and this year's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game\"><em>Squid Game</em></a>. The latter is currently Netflix's most-watched series to date, reaching <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/10/squid-game-netflix-142m-households-1234858503/\">over 142 million households</a> during its first month.</p>\n<p>So it's no wonder that Apple TV wants to emulate that success with <em>Dr. Brain</em>. Per the official premise: \"The series follows a brilliant brain scientist Sewon (Lee Sun-kyun) who suffers a horrific personal tragedy when his family falls victim to a mysterious accident. Desperate to uncover what happened, he goes to extraordinary lengths to solve the tragic mystery by conducting 'brain syncs' with the dead to access their memories for clues.\" The series also stars Lee You-young, Park Hee-soon, Seo Ji-hye, and Lee Jae-won.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807216#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807216&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c2d504eea1550afec21ef02bba9f36a87f69e2fcc8c62bedff1a60fa5e587bc","category":"Tech"}
