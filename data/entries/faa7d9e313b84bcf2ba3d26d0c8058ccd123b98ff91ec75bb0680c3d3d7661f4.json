It reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>September 21, 2021</p>\n\n<p>VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL</p>\n\n<p>Gary Bornstein <br />\nCravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP <br />\nWorldwide Plaza <br />\n825 Eighth Avenue <br />\nNew York, NY 10019-7475</p>\n\n<p>Re: Developer Program Account No. 8XJ6WJ8Z84</p>\n\n<p>Dear Gary,</p>\n\n<p>I am responding to your recent request that Apple reinstate Epic’s\ndeveloper program account, which was terminated for cause last\nyear. Epic committed an intentional breach of contract, and breach\nof trust, by concealing code from Apple and making related\nmisrepresentations and omissions. In its decision, the court\nrecognized that “Apple had contractual rights to act as It did. It\nmerely enforced those rights as [Epic’s] own internal documents\nshow Epic Games expected.” ECF No. 812 at 178-79. The court\nfurther found that “Apple’s termination of the [Developer Program\nLicense Agreement] and the related agreements between Epic Games\nand Apple was valid, lawful, and enforceable.” <em>Id.</em> at 179.\nFollowing that decision, Mr. Sweeney has publicly said that Epic\n“[w]ouldn’t trade [an alternative payment system] away to get\nFortnite back on iOS.” In light of this and other statements since\nthe court’s decision, coupled with Epic’s duplicitous conduct in\nthe past, Apple has exercised its discretion not to reinstate\nEpic’s developer program account at this time. Furthermore, Apple\nwill not consider any further requests for reinstatement until the\ndistrict court’s judgment becomes final and nonappealable.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n<p>/s/ Mark A. Perry <br />\nMark A. Perry</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s lawyer-speak, I believe, for “go fuck yourselves”.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2021-09-22-B\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711467888615431\">Sweeney is crying foul</a>, arguing that this contradicts Apple’s repeated public statements that Fortnite would be welcomed back to the App Store <em>if they came into full compliance with App Store rules</em>. Here’s a version of Apple’s statement from two weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/apple-blocks-epic-from-bringing-fortnite-back-to-the-app-store\">via Protocol</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the\nApp Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone\nelse. Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now,\nthere’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their\ndeveloper account.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple’s lawyers’ characterization of Sweeney’s statement about being unwilling to trade something away “to get Fortnite back on iOS” does seem like a bit of a hatchet-job, quote-editing-wise. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440712310339694592\">Sweeney tweeted the following on September 11</a>, one day after the Epic-v.-Apple decision was delivered:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thinking much more about whether we’re going to live in a world\nwhere two platform megacorps dictate software and world commerce\nto everyone or whether the digital world and the future metaverse\nwill be a free world. Wouldn’t trade that away to get Fortnite\nback on iOS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That doesn’t sound like the words of a man poised to comply with the App Store rules around in-app purchases. But, it doesn’t mean Epic <em>wasn’t</em> going to submit a Fortnite build that fully complies with the rules, either. Really does seem like Sweeney just thinking out loud in a tweet.</p>\n\n<p>Sweeney <em>also</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711578819567622\">tweeted an email</a> he sent to Phil Schiller on September 16. It reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From: Tim Sweeney <br />\nDate: Thu, Sep 16, 2021 at 5:01 PM <br />\nSubject: Fortnite and the App Store <br />\nTo: Phil Schiller  </p>\n\n<p>Hi Phil,</p>\n\n<p>I’m writing to provide clarity on where we stand.</p>\n\n<p>Epic has appealed the court’s decision in our suit over Apple’s\npolicies on In-App Purchase and competing stores. Though we can’t\nupdate the Fortnite version that users still have on their iOS\ndevices, we’ve disabled Epic payments server-side, and have paid\nApple $6,000,000 as ordered by the court.</p>\n\n<p>Epic has asked Apple to reactivate our Fortnite development\naccount. Epic promises that it will adhere to Apple’s guidelines\nwhenever and wherever we release products on Apple platforms.\nIf we get the account back, we’ll bring Fortnite back to Mac as\nsoon as possible, and we’ll reincorporate Fortnite for iOS in our\nUnreal Engine development and testing process, which will benefit\nall of our mutual developers.</p>\n\n<p>Whether Epic chooses to bring Fortnite back to iOS consumers\ndepends on whether and where Apple updates its guidelines to\nprovide for a level playing field between Apple In-App Purchase\nand other methods of payment.</p>\n\n<p>Epic will resubmit Fortnite to the App Store if you adhere to the\nplain language of the court order and allow apps to include\nbuttons and external links that direct customers to other\npurchasing mechanisms without onerous terms or impediments to a\ngood user experience. In that case, our remaining dispute will be\nabout competing stores, and I genuinely believe we could find\ncommon ground on the topic if Apple’s position were based solely\non user security and privacy rather than commercial interests.</p>\n\n<p>As a provider of developer tools, Epic continues to support Apple\nplatforms and our mutual developers wholeheartedly.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions or thoughts, I’m happy to talk.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Sweeney <br />\nEpic Games</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A few comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Epic promises that it will adhere to Apple’s guidelines whenever\nand wherever we release products on Apple platforms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Epic, of course, had previously promised the same thing, in a legally binding fashion, when they agreed to Apple’s developer account terms and conditions. But agreeing not to break Apple’s guidelines again seems in the spirit of what Apple had been asking for, regarding reinstating Fortnite.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Epic will resubmit Fortnite to the App Store if you adhere to the\nplain language of the court order and allow apps to include\nbuttons and external links that direct customers to other\npurchasing mechanisms without onerous terms or impediments to a\ngood user experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s where I think Sweeney garnered the legal “go fuck yourself”. Sweeney is arguing that Apple, which won the lawsuit, should interpret <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-apple-v-epic-decision/\">the court’s anti-steering injunction</a> in a way that pleases Epic, which lost the lawsuit. That’s not how things work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In that case, our remaining dispute will be about competing\nstores, and I genuinely believe we could find common ground on the\ntopic if Apple’s position were based solely on user security and\nprivacy rather than commercial interests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tim Sweeney is high as a kite.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>So here’s the thing to keep in mind, and that I think Sweeney purposefully muddled in the way he announced this news: Epic is a conglomerate with multiple subsidiaries, and those subsidiaries have their own Apple Developer Program accounts. The only developer account Apple ever disabled in this dispute was the one held by Epic Games, Inc. — the Fortnite account. It was disabled on 28 August, 2020 and has been disabled ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Accounts that have never been disabled include the accounts for Rocket League (a game whose Mac support <a href=\"https://www.rocketleague.com/news/ending-support-for-mac-and-linux/\">Epic discontinued in January 2020</a>, exemplifying Epic’s “wholehearted” support for “Apple platforms”), and separately and importantly, Unreal Engine. It <em>is</em> true that Apple moved to block the Unreal Engine account back in August 2020, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/apple-ordered-to-not-block-epic-games-unreal-engine-but-fortnite-to-stay-off-app-store/\">but Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple not to pending a decision in the case</a>, while allowing the Fortnite account to be blocked. In her ruling this month, however Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple would now be in its rights to disable any and all of Epic’s Apple developer accounts for breaching the  license agreement. (See p. 179 of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/10/judgment-in-epic-v-apple\">the ruling</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that none of those accounts are affected by Apple’s decision not to reinstate the Fortnite developer account. Those accounts have been operational throughout this legal dispute, and I believe will continue to be — by Apple’s choice.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Thank goodness lawyers seemingly always let you know in ALL CAPS when they send a letter via email, that they in fact SENT IT VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL. <a href=\"#fnr1-2021-09-22-B\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"faa7d9e313b84bcf2ba3d26d0c8058ccd123b98ff91ec75bb0680c3d3d7661f4","category":"Tech"}
