A helmet is something that the majority of cyclists wear for every single bike ride, and while increasing rider safety remains their primary objective, in recent years the trend has moved away from solely focussing on safety and ventilation to also using helmets as a means of improving performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best aero helmets feature some compromises in ventilation for the sake of reducing the amount of power required to travel at a given speed, ideal for those looking to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-increase-your-average-speed-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">increase the speed</a> of their rides or find an edge in races. This compromise in ventilation can be enough to offset the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-be-aerodynamic-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">aero savings</a> though, especially on warmer days. A hot head is uncomfortable and can also impact performance. This is where a semi-aero helmet can be optimal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is still important to look out for safety and fit features, such as an independent five-star <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">safety rating</a>, the inclusion of anti-<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kask-wg11-vs-mips-safety\" target=\"_blank\">rotational impact protection</a>, and adjustability at the cradle and straps/webbing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as aero performance goes, key features are often a narrower profile, extended length, fewer vents and deep internal channelling to allow plenty of airflow through the helmet and out the back. This can also aid ventilation but is often more effective at higher speeds. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best aero road cycling helmets </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abus Gamechanger 2.0: RRP £225 –<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/abus-gamechanger-2-0-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\"> Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ekoï Aerodinamica: RRP £335 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ekoi-aerodinamica-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giro Eclipse Spherical: RRP £239 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giro-eclipse-spherical-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>HJC Furion 2.0: RRP £180 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hjc-furion-2-0-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kask Nirvana: RRP £320 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/kask-nirvana-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Met Trenta 3K Mips: RRP £290 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/met-trenta-3k-carbon-mips-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Poc Procen Air: RRP £360  – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/poc-procen-air-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scott Cadence Plus: RRP £230 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scott-cadence-plus-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized Propero 4: RRP £165 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-propero-4-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trek Ballista: RRP £230 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-ballista-mips-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>How do we test and why trust our advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of our product reviewers are avid cyclists who have been riding for many years. They have all built up a huge array of experience from riding in various conditions and testing what kit works and doesn’t work in these situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These helmets were tested in a mix of conditions, terrains and speeds to help determine the effectiveness of the ventilation both at high speeds and low speeds, as well as in warmer summer weather. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of thousands of kilometres these helmets have all been put through their paces to bring you a definitive guide to how they fit, how practical they are, how well ventilated they are, and in theory, using company supplied data and their in-house aerodynamic assessments, how quick they should be.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

Gamechanger adds new features, such as a brow vent to reduce sweating into the eyes, although venting isn’t very effective at lower speeds and the head can get hot.

A size M weighs 268g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two glasses ports, one at the front and one at the rear, work well with a range of cycling sunglasses, although glasses can knock against the helmet’s rim when worn. To up the aero, Abus doesn’t include strap adjustment, while the fit works better for those with oval heads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gamechanger 2.0 is good value for a pro-level aero helmet and there are nine colours sold for the non-Mips variant, offering plenty of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/abus-gamechanger-2-0-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Abus Gamechanger 2.0 helmet review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ekoï Aerodinamica</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"ekoi aerodinamica aero road helmet from the side\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/EkoiAero10-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £335.10 / $420.93 / €389.99 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Impressively well ventilated</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Very expensive</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Big aero brand names back up performance claims</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ekoï Aerodinamica adds to the standard makeup of EPS foam and polycarbonate shell with the inclusion of Koroyd crumple zone inserts in strategic locations to aid protection from high speed direct impacts as well as rotational impacts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile the body of the helmet has been designed with aero experts from SwissSide and Pininfarina who have decades of experience in cycling and motorsports aerodynamics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet comes with some strong performance claims, however limited data to back them up. One thing that is tangible is the impressive cooling at speeds above 30kmh and even in temperatures nearing 30˚C. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of glasses storage is a shame, and the rear dial feels a little cheap. Although the helmet is on the heavy side at 332g, this isn’t really noticeable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big number is the price: £335 (although Ekoï prices in Euros and its products are frequently discounted) making this one of the most expensive road helmets on the market. However, for fast paced rides and race days it may perform well enough to warrant that expense for some riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ekoi-aerodinamica-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ekoï Aerodinamica helmet</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ekoi-aerodinamica-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ekoi.com%2Fen-gb%2Froad-cycling-helmets%2F12790-helmet-ekoi-aerodinamica-by-pininfarina-white-red.html%3Fsc%3Dgb\" target=\"_blank\">Eko<strong>ï</strong> (£335)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Giro Eclipse Spherical</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Eds-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Giro Eclipse aero road helmet from the side\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GiroEclipse09-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £239 / $250 / €260</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Great ventilation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mips Spherical technology</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Good value</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giro Eclipse helmet features the Mips Spherical rotational impact protection system from Giro that includes two separate layers of helmet that can move independently of each other. It was also used in Giro’s previous generation pro-level Aether helmet, which is still highly rated and is effective enough to have achieved a five-star safety rating in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Tech’s independent testing</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero performance comes from virtual aerofoil technology that makes the Giro Eclipse helmet behave as if it’s longer than it is. The large number of vents and channelling result in impressive ventilation not just at higher speeds but also at lower ones, while clever padding helps reduce the chance of sweat getting into your eyes. All this comes at a good price for a helmet of this calibre, making it an impressive all-round performer.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giro-eclipse-spherical-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Giro Eclipse Spherical helmet review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>HJC Furion 2.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"HJC Furion 2.0 helmet from the side worn by review writer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/HJCFurion09-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £180 / $199 / €199</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Self-adjusting fit system without a dial</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low weight</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No rotational impact system</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tagged as a semi-aero helmet, the HJC Furion 2.0 uses the Venturi effect to help keep your head cooler.

At 224g for a size M its weight is low and the £180 price is competitive. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hjc-furion-2-0-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">HJC Furion 2.0 helmet review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kask Nirvana</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"kask nirvana helmet from the side worn by review writer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/KaskNirvana_18-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £320 / $400 / €360</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Multipod 3D printed padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ear covers to improve aerodynamics</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One of the most expensive helmets available</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Kask’s latest aero helmet has ear covers that partially envelop the ear lobes and, Kask says, improve aerodynamics by 35% over its Utopia Y.

In fact the Procen is Poc’s TT helmet, while the Procen Air shortens the tail slightly and makes the ear covers removable and smaller to comply with UCI rules.. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still uses the Venturi effect, where the vents at the front are situated where the highest air pressure location is. Air is then funnelled through the internal channels in the helmet and out of the exhaust ports to reduce turbulence at the rear and aid ventilation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, above 30kmh the ventilation is impressively good, but at lower speeds or climbing the Procen Air can get uncomfortably warm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The included visors are very good, with the magnetic attachment being effective at the front while the magnetic visor storage at the back is practical. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price is sky high at £360, but the inclusion of both a mirror and a clear visor do boost the value nicely. Although the weight is high at 355g with the visor or 323g without, it is not really noticeable when riding. For those looking for every marginal gain, this helmet may well be worth the sizable investment. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/poc-procen-air-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Poc Procen Air helmet review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://poc.com/en-gb/product/procen-air-hydrogen-white\" target=\"_blank\">POC (£360)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scott Cadence Plus </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Rec-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Cadence aero road helmet from the side\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ScottCadence12-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £229.99 / $229.99 / €249.90</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Included rear light</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Good ventilation </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fast in more positions</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scott Cadence Plus includes many of the now commonplace aero road helmet features such as larger vents at the front, deep internal channelling and exhaust vents at the rear.

All this for £229.99 makes the helmet great value, but in the white colour sweat can stain the shell.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scott-cadence-plus-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Cadence Plus helmet review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Propero 4 </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Great-1.png\" /><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Rec-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Propero 4 road helmet from the side\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SpecPropero10-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £165 / $200 / €190 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Great value</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Good balance of aero and venting</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5-star safety rating</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Specialized Propero 4 has been designed using technologies and lessons learned from the S-Works Prevail 3 and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-evade-3-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Evade 3</a> to create a helmet that bridges the gap between the two but is nearly £100 cheaper than either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A standard EPS foam and polycarbonate shell are used, and instead of Mips Air Node the Propero features a Mips Evolve liner, but still scores five stars in Virginia Tech’s safety testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fitting system is the same as found on the S-Works models and allows plenty of adjustment to ensure a comfortable fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Propero is a semi-aero helmet with aero features from the Evade and venting features from the Prevail. In practice it is neither as vented as the Prevail nor as aero as the Evade, according to Specialized’s data, but it does a decent enough job at both while at £165 it comes in at less than half the price of several of the helmets in this buyer’s guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-propero-4-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Propero 4 helmet review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trek Ballista</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Ballista Mips helmet side profile\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/TrekBallista09-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Price: £229.99 / $299.99 / €299.99 </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good value</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pretty lightweight</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can get very warm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trek Ballista combines claimed aero performance – the fastest helmet it has ever made, according to Trek – with many highly practical features. A Boa dial is used for the retention and works very well compared to other dial offerings, while the cradle can also lie flat to make storage that little bit easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The side vents feature rubber inserts, meaning pretty much any pair of glasses sits securely in the vents. The helmet is also quite lightweight for an aero helmet, with the open rear assisting in this, along with the Mips Air Node system, which also helps the helmet towards a five-star independent safety rating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However even with the very open rear and some large vents at the front, the Ballista can get very hot quite quickly when travelling at lower speeds, and the padding gets saturated with sweat very easily. Overall it performs well, and at £229.99 is good value, but in warm weather it was not ideal for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-ballista-mips-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Ballista helmet review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fballista-mips%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Trek (£230)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose the best aero road helmet for you</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"758\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-970x758.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-970x758.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-300x235.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-768x600.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-1536x1201.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-2048x1601.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-750x586.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/simon-gehr-aeroad-444-1140x891.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Simon Gehr / Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is the benefit of an aero helmet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest benefit of an aero road helmet over a standard road helmet is the promised watt savings and therefore improved speed for the same effort. The difference between a good aero helmet and a less aero one can be as much as 10-15 watts at 35-40kmh and even more compared to a standard helmet, so it’s worth checking the numbers to see if a helmet’s aero claims stack up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why use an aero helmet over a more vented design?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of a ride, an aero road helmet should mean you finish a given distance in a faster time than a less aero one. Those wanting to shave time off their 10-mile <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-time-trials\" target=\"_blank\">time-trial</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-ride-your-first-century-tips-for-beginners-to-reach-100-miles\" target=\"_blank\">100-mile bike ride</a>, or Ironman bike leg could all see significant improvements by using an aero helmet over a standard one and it’s free speed for all riders too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need to be fast to see a benefit? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there will be higher watt savings at the higher speeds such as the 40, 45 or 50kmh at which brands often quote their watt savings, at slower speeds there can also be potential for an increase in speed or reduction in energy output. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 45kmh a 10W saving will not result in a huge speed increase, whereas at 30kmh a 5W saving will likely result in a relatively larger increase in speed as the power required to overcome aerodynamic drag increases at a cubic rate proportional to speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do we tell if a helmet is aero? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t validate aero claims without testing them individually using a wind-tunnel, velodrome testing, or controlled aero sensor use. However, there are several aero design cues we can see in helmets such as reduced frontal profile, reduced or sculpted vents, extended tails, or internal channelling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helmet makers typically provide plenty of data about the watts saved by their aero helmets, as this is their major selling point, although as with all aero testing it’s difficult or impossible to compare like for like as testing conditions vary.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/aero-lightweight-all-rounder-fastest-road-bike\">Aero vs lightweight vs all-rounder: which is the fastest road bike?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-helmet\">Best cycling helmet: Road and gravel bike helmets from under £100 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\">Bike helmet safety: Standards, testing and tech, plus Virginia Tech’s top-rated helmets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-be-aerodynamic-cycling\">How to get more aero on your bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\">Best aero road bikes 2024: Ride faster for less effort</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-helmets\">Best aero road cycling helmets reviewed 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7dbd9110d1cd0e52b8a137300d2c0b1fea0bb7413c51563cf3155590ccd46801","category":"Cycling"}
