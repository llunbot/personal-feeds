Utilizing a graphene-coated and finned back plate plus a graphene-infused pad material itself, the brake pads lead AB to claim up to 35% improved braking performance on long, sustained descents. Apparently, the pads are good enough that Tadej Pogačar has been trying them on his own bike along with other members of Team UAE, despite not being contractually obligated to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance claims aside, the big news today is that the pads have gotten a bit cheaper due to “optimized production costs”. For example, at the time of publishing in 2022, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/absoluteblack-graphenpads-graphene-infused-disc-brake-pads-promise-fade-free-performance/\">SRAM eTap AXS pads</a> were $62.99 per wheel. That same set of brake pads now runs $51.90. Still expensive for a set of disc brake pads, but it’s nice to see a price decreasing instead of increasing lately. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-disc-29-sram-code-1.jpg\" alt=\"absoluteBLACK graphene brake pads\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-disc-29-sram-code-1.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-disc-29-sram-code-1-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-disc-29-sram-code-1-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-disc-29-sram-code-1-768x480.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-pads-disc-33-magura-mt7-1.jpg\" alt=\"absoluteBLACK graphene brake pads\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-pads-disc-33-magura-mt7-1.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-pads-disc-33-magura-mt7-1-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-pads-disc-33-magura-mt7-1-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/graphenpads-pads-disc-33-magura-mt7-1-768x480.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n<figcaption>(All images/AB)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>AB is also adding two new MTB fitments – SRAM Code and Magura MT5/MT7. Both sets of brake pads are $42.90 per wheel, though the Magura set is four pads (8 are needed per bike). Both are available now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://absoluteblack.cc/chainrings.html\"><em>absoluteblack.cc</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/absoluteblack-graphenpads-get-less-expensive-add-new-mtb-compatibility/\">absoluteBLACK GRAPHENpads Get Less Expensive, Add New MTB Compatibility</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e6c4070ced329423695a9170434c68c89a8088d3cc3466a2ec854c81974bc28f","category":"Cycling"}
