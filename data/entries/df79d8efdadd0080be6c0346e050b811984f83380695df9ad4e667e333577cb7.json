The alleged new version of the band features a clasp instead of a magnet and seems to come in a 49mm size designed for the Apple Watch Ultra. The current Milanese Loop is only available in 41mm and 45mm sizes. A clasp like this would be a more secure solution for the Milanese Loop without compromising adjustability since the magnet used on the current version is liable to slipping, which loosens the band.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Possible colors available <a href=\"https://t.co/73wU0Rcf2i\">pic.twitter.com/73wU0Rcf2i</a></p>â€” Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1832127332506857586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Milanese Loop Apple Watch band was introduced alongside the original Apple Watch in 2014 as part of Apple's premium range of bands. Inspired by traditional 19th-century Milanese watch bands, it features a unique mesh design made from woven stainless steel to offer both flexibility and durability. Initially available in Silver and later in Space Black, the Milanese Loop has remained a staple of Apple's watch band lineup across all Apple Watch generations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to introduce the third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, the Apple Watch Series 10, and a new dark color option for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> at the \"It's Glowtime\" event later today, so the introduction of new bands is likely. Weibo leaker known as \"Instant Digital\" today <a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/5143897135\">claimed</a> that despite some rumors suggesting that the Apple Watch's band system could change this year, it will remain the same with compatibility carried forward.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMacRumors will have in-depth coverage of the Apple event, which kicks off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, including a live blog on our website and posts via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">@MacRumorsLive on X</a>.
