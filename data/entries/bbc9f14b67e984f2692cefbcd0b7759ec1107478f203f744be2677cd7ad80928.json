Intel will also stop using \"generational\" messaging in its processor brandingâ€”none of the new CPUs will be announced, released, or advertised as \"14th-generation\" anything.</p>\n\n<p>Intel's generational branding has always been a bit arbitrary, anyway. The \"first-generation\" Core chips followed several generations of Core and Core 2 processors, the branding Intel started using for its chips in the mid-2000s at the end of the Pentium 4 era. And the Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad branding was used for several distinct generations of chips that used different manufacturing technologies and revised architectures.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946603#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946603&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbc9f14b67e984f2692cefbcd0b7759ec1107478f203f744be2677cd7ad80928","category":"Tech"}
