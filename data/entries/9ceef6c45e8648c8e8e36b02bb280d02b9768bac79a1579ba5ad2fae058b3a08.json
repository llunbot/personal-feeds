It’s a great piece of plastic origami. A smart reimagined, readaptation of a classic folding plastic crate, Allpacka created a sturdy wide basket to fit on almost any normal bike rack, that quickly folds out of the way in a literal second when not needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, you can pre-order One through Allpacka’s Kickstarter, to be ready to cart around your commuter bike cargo next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Allpacka One folding commuter bike rack cargo basket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Allpacka One folding commuter bike rack cargo basket, folded down\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Allpacka-One-folding-commuter-bike-rack-cargo-basket_closed-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s this simple.
