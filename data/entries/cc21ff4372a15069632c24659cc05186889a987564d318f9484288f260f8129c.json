Limited to comments of threeÂ minutes or less, nearly five dozen people spoke during the hearing over Zoom.</p>\n<p>By my informal counting, the comments tallied 39 in favor of the project and 18 against. The comments in favor of SpaceX were more likely to come from out of state, from people generally appreciative of the company's efforts to make humanity a \"multiplanetary species.\" However, there were plenty of local supporters as well.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805592#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805592&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cc21ff4372a15069632c24659cc05186889a987564d318f9484288f260f8129c","category":"Tech"}
