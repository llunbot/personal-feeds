They help give you a clear view down the trail, with less glare, less squinting and less possibility of damage to your eyes from harmful UV rays.</p>\n<p>They also provide physical protection from flying trail debris, whether that be roost from another rider’s back wheel, spray from puddles, bugs or errant tree branches.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the larger the lens, the more coverage it will offer against these dangers, but it’s also important they wrap around to give some side protection, cut out light from entering and prevent wind from making your eyes tear up.</p>\n<p>Of course, that coverage needs to be balanced with how they fit on your face – if the lens or frame contacts you, the glasses will fog up more easily and can become uncomfortable or move around on your face.</p>\n<p>Many mountain bike glasses use a half-frame design, where the lens is only partially attached to the frame, This enables a greater and less obstructed field of vision, but it does mean the lens is more exposed to damage when not being worn.</p>\n<p>Depending on your facial features and head size, different frames might work better for some people than others. Although we try to point out which glasses work best for different people, it’s hard to beat trying them on.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Smith Bobcat glasses for mountain bikers\" title=\"Smith Bobcat glasses - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It is a good idea to test glasses with the helmet you are going to wear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Make sure they integrate well with your chosen <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">helmet</a>, too, and don’t dig into your head or create pressure points.</p>\n<p>Whatever anyone might claim, looks can also be important, but that’s very much a personal choice and often there will be a selection of frame colours on offer for a model.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"scott pro shield glasses nose\" title=\"scott pro shield glasses nose\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Textured nose pieces and arms will keep your glasses in place when riding bumpy trails.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>More expensive MTB sunglasses tend to have more features, such as easily interchangeable lenses, plus adjustable fit of the nose piece and arms. The quality and clarity of the lenses will go up with price too. A better lens will have improved clarity and distort your vision less.</p>\n<p>Many high-end mountain bike glasses now have light-sensitive photochromic lenses, which have a special coating that reacts to light.</p>\n<p>This means you can use a single lens for very bright days as well as more overcast ones, but even the best can take a bit of time to react, and cheaper ones can take even longer.</p>\n<p>Now you’ve got the basics, here are the best sunglasses for mountain biking we’ve tested recently.</p>\n<h2>Best sunglasses for mountain biking</h2>\n<h3>100% S3</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"100% S3 bike riding sunglasses\" title=\"MTB Sunglasses - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Coverage is great and the frame remained outside our peripheral vision.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£170/$185 as tested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Available in a wide choice of lens tints, the S3s on test had the HiPER red mirror lens, which we found to be incredibly versatile and covers a wide range of light conditions.</p>\n<p>With impressive clarity and pop, it’s without doubt one of the best pairs of mountain bike sunglasses we’ve tested. The coverage is great and the frame remained outside our peripheral vision.</p>\n<p>The glasses are also very comfortable and stay securely in place no matter what you’re riding over. There were no compatibility issues with our helmets and a clear lens is included.</p>\n<p>The glasses don’t quite score full marks because they don’t have the best lens ventilation (but we didn’t steam them up). The nosepiece is flimsily attached and you also pay for the performance.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Madison Crypto</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Madison Crypto Sunglasses - 3 pack for mountain bikers\" title=\"Madison Crypto - main\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Crypto is a top-performing, excellent-value pair of riding glasses.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / OurMedia</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£60 as tested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Madison Crypto glasses offer excellent optical clarity and the large lens means optimum eye coverage in all conditions.</p>\n<p>All three lenses are effective at their jobs, with the amber being the most versatile and usable in a range of light conditions.

We tested the orange lens, which performs well in a wide variety of trail conditions, from overcast to dappled light.</p>\n<p>While lens ventilation is on the more minimal side, the frame sits away from your face, so airflow is still good. The temple tips are short and tuck behind the ears for a secure and comfortable fit that avoids helmet straps. Extra points for the styling, too.</p>\n<p>This particular lens isn’t best suited to bright direct sunshine, although glare wasn’t a big issue. Another downside with the Pro Shields is that they don’t fit smaller faces so well.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>BBB Avenger</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BBB Avenger mountain bike riding glasses\" title=\"Six of the nest sunglasses mtb 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Three lenses are included: a dark tint, yellow for low light, and clear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£50 as tested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite sitting very close to your face, especially over the cheeks, these BBB glasses have good ventilation, thanks to cutaways at the top of the lens.
