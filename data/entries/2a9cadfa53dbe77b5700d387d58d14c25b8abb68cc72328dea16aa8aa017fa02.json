Thompson’s column for ESPN, written 24 hours after the attack:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all\nhopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other\ncountry. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now — with\nsomebody — and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for\nthe rest of our lives.</p>\n\n<p>It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by\nreligious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It\nwill be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines\nand no identifiable enemy. Osama bin Laden may be a primitive\n“figurehead” — or even dead, for all we know — but whoever put\nthose All-American jet planes loaded with All-American fuel into\nthe Twin Towers and the Pentagon did it with chilling precision\nand accuracy. The second one was a dead-on bullseye. Straight into\nthe middle of the skyscraper.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing — even George Bush’s $350 billion “Star Wars” missile\ndefense system — could have prevented Tuesday’s attack, and it\ncost next to nothing to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide\nsoldiers from some apparently primitive country somewhere on the\nother side of the world took out the World Trade Center and half\nthe Pentagon with three quick and costless strikes on one day. The\nefficiency of it was terrifying.</p>\n\n<p>We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or\nwhat will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe\nAfghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at\nonce. Who knows? Not even the Generals in what remains of the\nPentagon or the New York papers calling for WAR seem to know who\ndid it or where to look for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The good Dr. Thompson’s voice is sorely missed today.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/12/fear-and-loathing-in-america\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2a9cadfa53dbe77b5700d387d58d14c25b8abb68cc72328dea16aa8aa017fa02","category":"Tech"}
