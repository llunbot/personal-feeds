{"title":"Axios: ‘Warner Bros. Discovery in Talks to Merge With Paramount’","link":"https://www.axios.com/2023/12/20/warner-bros-paramount-merger-discovery-streaming","date":1703208642000,"content":"\n<p>Sara Fischer, reporting for Axios:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav met with Paramount Global \nCEO Bob Bakish on Tuesday in New York City to discuss a possible \nmerger, Axios has learned from multiple sources. [...] Zaslav also \nhas spoken to Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount’s parent company, \nabout a deal. </p>\n\n<p>WBD’s market value was around $29 billion as of Wednesday, while \nParamount’s was just over $10 billion, so any merger would not be \nof equals. The meeting between Zaslav and Bakish, which sources \nsay lasted several hours, took place at Paramount’s headquarters \nin Times Square. The duo discussed ways their companies could \ncomplement one another. For example, each company’s main streaming \nservice — Paramount+ and Max — could merge to better rival \nNetflix and Disney+. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Merging the streaming platforms would be a certainty. Consolidation is coming — sooner rather than later — to the streaming industry, and Paramount+ has no chance whatsoever on its own. They just don’t have nearly enough original prestige-quality content, and their low-quality filler content is just shows from CBS that you can get for free on regular TV. But because they do own CBS, it limits their options for who they can merge with — Disney owns ABC and Comcast owns NBC, so they’re out. Make Paramount a studio within Warner Bros. Discovery, close Paramount+, and add all the content to Max. This seems so obvious I’d bet it will happen.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I’m an idiot — money falls through my hands like water (as my late friend Dean Allen <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20051226074051/http://www.textism.com/about/\">said of himself</a>) — so I stay subscribed to too many streaming services. Smart industrious people pay attention to what’s being offered and what they’re actually watching on each streaming service, and churn — subscribe for a month or two, watch the thing you wanted to watch, and then unsubscribe. Dumb lazy people like me subscribe to a service to watch one show and then just stay subscribed. That was me with Paramount+, and the show was <em><a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/the-offer/\">The Offer</a></em> — an excellent 10-part series about the development and production of <em>The Godfather</em>.<sup><em></em></sup> I watched that *last year and yet lo, here I am, still paying $12/month for Paramount+. I keep telling myself I’m going to watch the third season of <em>Picard</em> but I ought to just give up, cancel my subscription today, and just wait for the merger and for <em>Picard</em> to show up inside Max.</p>\n\n<p><small>* I’d promise to stay subscribed to Paramount+ if they promised to make a sequel/spin-off starring Matthew Goode as Robert Evans, who, in my opinion, just fucking stole <em>The Offer</em>.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/21/warner-bros-paramount\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2fc5d960cd7e27f52f5793f9c4e750421cfe60188157ba302bc0973890cbde3e","category":"Tech"}
