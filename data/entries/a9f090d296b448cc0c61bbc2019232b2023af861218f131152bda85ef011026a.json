Epic Games\n<a href=\"https://x.com/fortnite/status/1924949632628523199?s=46\">announced</a> the return of the battle royale gaming app this\nafternoon, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortnite/id6483539426\">you can head to the App Store</a> now to\ndownload it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Son of a bitch Epic did it. This was like a double bank shot.</p>\n\n<p>It was smart for Apple to just concede here. <em>Pick your battles</em> is a cliché but it’s a great truism. Even if Apple’s executives still wanted to keep Fortnite out of the App Store, even if they still think they’d win, ultimate, in court, why fight over this? I think they <em>would</em> win, but probably not with Judge Gonzales Rogers, so they’d be looking at a protracted series of appeals. Why bother?</p>\n\n<p>Also, fascinatingly, neither Apple nor anyone from Apple has commented on this whole thing at any point. Epic published the letter their attorneys received from Apple’s attorneys, which I’m sure Apple fully expected, but Apple itself has never said a word about Epic’s submission of Fortnite to the US App Store.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/21/fortnite-returns\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a9f090d296b448cc0c61bbc2019232b2023af861218f131152bda85ef011026a","category":"Tech"}
