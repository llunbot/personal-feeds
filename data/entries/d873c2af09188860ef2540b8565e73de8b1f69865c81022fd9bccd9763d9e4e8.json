{"title":"A Practical Guide To Designing For Colorblind People","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/designing-for-colorblindness/","date":1708430400000,"content":"<p>Too often, accessibility is seen as a checklist, but it’s much more complex than that. We might be using a good contrast for our colors, but then, if these colors are <strong>perceived very differently</strong> by people, it can make interfaces extremely difficult to use.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on our color combinations, people with color weakness or who are colorblind won’t be able to tell them apart. Here are <strong>key points for designing with colorbliness</strong> — for better and more reliable color choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is <strong>part of our ongoing series</strong> on <a href=\"/category/design-patterns\">design patterns</a>. It’s also a part of the video library on <a href=\"https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/\">Smart Interface Design Patterns</a> 🍣 and is available in the <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/interface-design-course-vitaly-friedman-spring/\">live UX training</a> as well.</p>\n\nColorweakness and Colorblindness\n<p>It’s worth stating that, like any other disability, colorblind users are on the <strong>spectrum</strong>, as <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/belagaytan/\">Bela Gaytán</a> rightfully noted. Each experience is unique, and different people perceive colors differently. The grades of colorblindness <strong>vary significantly</strong>, so there is no consistent condition that would be the same for everyone.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-for-colorblindness/1-color-weakness-statistics.png\" /></p>\n<p>When we speak about colors, we should distinguish between two different conditions that people might have. Some people experience <strong>deficiencies</strong> in <em>“translating”</em> light waves into red-ish, green-ish or blue-ish colors. If one of these translations is not working properly, a person is at least <em>colorweak</em>. If the translation doesn’t work at all, a person is <em>colorblind</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the color combinations we use, people with color weakness or people who are colorblind won’t be able to tell them apart. The most common use case is a red-/green deficiency, which <strong>affects 8% of European men</strong> and <strong>0.5% of European women</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note</em>: the insights above come from “<a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorblindness-part1/\">How Your Colorblind And Colorweak Readers See Your Colors</a>,” a wonderful three-part series by Lisa Charlotte Muth on how colorblind and color weak readers perceive colors, things to consider when visualizing data and <strong>what it’s like to be colorblind</strong>.</p>\n\nDesign Guidelines For Colorblindness\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/garethrobins/\">Gareth Robins</a> has kindly noted, the safe option is to either give people a <strong>colorblind toggle with shapes</strong> or use a friendly ubiquitous palette like <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html\">viridis</a>. Of course, we should never ever ask a colorblind person, “What color is this?” as they can’t correctly answer that question.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-for-colorblindness/2-red-and-green-blind-palettes.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>✅ <strong>Red-/green deficiencies</strong> are more common in men.<br />\n✅ <strong>Use blue</strong> if you want users to perceive color as you do.<br />\n✅ Use any 2 colors as long as they <strong>vary by lightness</strong>.<br />\n✅ Colorbrlind users <strong>can tell red and green apart</strong>.<br />\n✅ Colorbrlind users <strong>can’t tell dark green and brown apart</strong>.<br />\n✅ Colorbrlind users <strong>can’t tell red and brown apart</strong>.<br />\n✅ The safest color palette is to <strong>mix blue with orange or red</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-for-colorblindness/3-purple-blue-colorblindness.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>🚫 <strong>Don’t mix red, green and brown</strong> together.<br />\n🚫 <strong>Don’t mix pink, turquoise and grey</strong> together.<br />\n🚫 <strong>Don’t mix purple and blue</strong> together.<br />\n🚫 Don’t use green and pink if you use red and blue.<br />\n🚫 Don’t mix green with orange, red, or blue of the same lightness.</p>\n\nNever Rely On Colors Alone\n<p>It’s worth noting that the safest bet is to <strong>never rely on colors alone</strong> to communicate data. Use labels, icons, shapes, rectangles, triangles, and stars to indicate differences and show relationships. Be careful when <strong>combining hues and patterns</strong>: patterns change how bright or dark colors will be perceived.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-for-colorblindness/4-whocanuse-tool.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whocanuse.com\">Who Can Use?</a> is a fantastic little tool to quickly see how a color palette affects different people with visual impairments — from reduced sensitivity to red, to red/green blindness to cataracts, glaucoma, low vision and even situational events such as direct sunlight and night shift mode.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use lightness to build gradients</strong>, not just hue. Use different lightnesses in your gradients and color palettes so readers with a color vision deficiency will still be able to distinguish your colors. And most importantly, always include colorweak and colorblind people in usability testing.</p>\n\n<h3>Useful Resources on Colorblindness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23650428/colorblindness-design-ui-accessibility-wordle\">How I Live With Color Blindness</a>,” by Andy Baio</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whocanuse.com/\">Who Can Use This Color Combination?</a>, by Corey Ginnivan</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://colorblindaccessibilitymanifesto.com/\">Colorblind Accessibility Manifesto</a>, by Federico Monaco </li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://medium.com/queer-design-club/going-beyond-color-9d3830559e10\">Designing for Colorblind Access</a>,” by Alex Chen</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-colorblind-friendly-design-case-study-among-us-dcd042c87b9\">The UX of Among Us: The Importance of Colorblind-friendly Design</a>,” by Unma Desai</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors/\">How To Choose Colors For Data Visualization</a>,” by Lisa Charlotte Muth</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-ux-for-color-blind-users/\">Improving The UX For Color-Blind Users</a>,” by Adam Silver</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/06/testing-sites-apps-blind-users-cheat-sheet/\">How To Test With Blind Users: A Cheatsheet</a>,” by Slava Shestopalov, Eugene Shykiriavyi</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Useful Colorblindness Tools</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/\">Coblis, Color Blindness Simulator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/\">Colorblindness Web Page Filters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733343906244951586/Color-Blind\">Color Blindness Simulator Figma Plugin</a>, by Sam Mason de Caires</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblindly/floniaahmccleoclneebhhmnjgdfijgg\">Colorblindly Chrome Extension</a>, by Andrew Van Ness</li>\n</ul>\n\nMeet Smart Interface Design Patterns\n<p>If you are interested in similar insights around UX, take a look at <a href=\"https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/\"><strong>Smart Interface Design Patterns</strong></a>, our <strong>10h-video course</strong> with 100s of practical examples from real-life projects — with a <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/interface-design-course-vitaly-friedman-spring/\">live UX training</a> starting March 7.
