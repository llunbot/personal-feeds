You can put spoons and forks all over and they can stick because now we think there is a metal piece to that.\"</p>\n<p>Her testimony was in support of a bill that would largely ban vaccine mandates in Ohio. The bill never made it out of committee. But the state's medical board opened an investigation the next month. The board intended to ask Tenpenny a variety of questions, including about her statements \"regarding COVID-19 vaccines causing people to become magnetized or creating an interface with 5G towers… and regarding some major metropolitan areas liquefying dead bodies and pouring them into the water supply,\" according to <a href=\"https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/med.ohio.gov/formala/34003789.pdf\">a board report.</a></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022563#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022563&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3bdab5eda12f9d9e87e52b0849b53c6de147c18b62b49f665b781811c424816d","category":"Tech"}
