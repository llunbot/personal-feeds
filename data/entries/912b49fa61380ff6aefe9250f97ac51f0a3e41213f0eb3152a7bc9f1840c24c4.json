Batteries go where it makes the most sense in terms of stability and safety. Electric motors are compact and don't need much cooling compared to a combustion engine, and there's no exhaust to worry about.</p>\n<p>Putting the motors close to the wheels makes sense—in the wheel itself if possible—and it seems that a startup called Donut Labs may have solved some of the problems hub-mounted motors have faced in the past.</p>\n<p>You can see where the name came from—the motors look like metal donuts. That originally had me thinking they used <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/mercedes-benz-showcases-axial-flux-ev-motor-in-one-eleven-concept-car/\">axial flux technology</a>, as some hybrid supercars do, but I was mistaken. These are radial flux motors, just ones that make a lot of torque considering their size and mass.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/these-compact-electric-motors-could-revolutionize-ev-design/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/these-compact-electric-motors-could-revolutionize-ev-design/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
