And yet XP activation, the actual encrypted algorithm, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/memory-lane-before-everyone-loved-windows-xp-they-hated-it/\">loathed</a> since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2001/02/wpa/\">before it started</a>, has never been truly broken, at least entirely offline. Now, far past the logical end of all things XP, the solution exists, floating around the web's forum-based backchannels for months now.</p>\n<p>On the blog of tinyapps.org (first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/windows_xp_activation_cracked/\">The Register</a>), which provides micro-scale, minimalist utilities for constrained Windows installations, a blog post appropriately titled \"<a href=\"https://tinyapps.org/blog/202304230700_xp_wpa.html\">Windows XP Activation: GAME OVER</a>\" runs down the semi-recent history of folks looking to activate Windows XP more than 20 years after it debuted, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/xpocalypse-now-windows-xp-support-has-ended/\">nine years after its end of life</a>, and, crucially, <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/1502796/how-do-i-activate-windowsxp-now-that-support-has-ended\">some years</a> after Microsoft turned off its online activation servers (or maybe they just <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.3.0-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D1942506%26action%3Dedit&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fold.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwindowsxp%2Fcomments%2Fwwjy5j%2Fwindows_xp_web_activation_is_finally_dead%2Fillm8jz%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=7088dccf3462a17919b7612882ef763d&amp;xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D\">swapped certificates</a>).</p>\n<p>xp_activate32.exe, a 18,432-byte program (hash listed on <a href=\"https://tinyapps.org/blog/202304230700_xp_wpa.html\">tinyapps' blog post</a>), takes the code generated by Windows XP's phone activation option and processes it into a proper activation key (Confirmation ID), entirely offline. It's persistent across system wipes and re-installs. It is, seemingly, the same key Microsoft would provide for your computer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942506#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942506&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a32a10725de699f0d7d26f8d5bfcad831a1527041d74e1cfaf741560b4ba35c7","category":"Tech"}
