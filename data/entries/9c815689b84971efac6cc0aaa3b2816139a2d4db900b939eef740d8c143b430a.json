The companies released the tools as part of the Data Transfer Initiative, which is focused on ensuring that customers can download their data from one online service and upload it to another.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle's tool merely creates a copy of your photos and videos for another service. The original photos and videos will remain in your Google Photos account following the transfer process, unless they are manually deleted afterwards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore details can be found in the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9666875\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118257\">Apple</a> support documents for each tool, and on the <a href=\"https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/07/10/DTI-members-new-photo-video-tool\">Data Transfer Initiative blog</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-photos/\">Google Photos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photos/\">iCloud Photos</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/google-photos-to-icloud-photos-transfer-tool/\">Easily Switch From Google Photos to iCloud Photos With This New Tool</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/easily-switch-from-google-photos-to-icloud-photos-with-this-new-tool.2431076/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c815689b84971efac6cc0aaa3b2816139a2d4db900b939eef740d8c143b430a","category":"Apple"}
