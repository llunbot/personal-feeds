{"title":"Twitter Staff Exodus Continues After a Weird, Sad Day on Twitter Even by Twitter’s Weird, Sad Standards","link":"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/06/02/twitter-briefly-took-a-stand-against-hate-but-then-elon-admitted-it-was-all-a-mistake/","date":1685726665000,"content":"\n<p>Mike Masnick, writing at TechDirt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Basically, a manufactured martyrdom controversy, combined with\nTwitter pretending to stand up to encouraging hatred, only for\nMusk to double down that hate has a comfy, welcoming home on\nTwitter.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, in the midst of all this, the news came out that Ella\nIrwin, who had been leading trust and safety since relatively early\nin the Elon Musk reign, and who had been on Twitter through\nWednesday directly responding to trust and safety requests, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-management-idUSKBN2XN3WY\">had\nresigned</a> and was no longer at the company. It’s unclear if\nher resignation had anything to do with this mess, but the timing\ndoes seem notable.</p>\n\n<p>Still, given all of this, is it really any wonder that advertisers\nlike Ben &amp; Jerry’s have announced that they’re <a href=\"https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2023/05/ending-paid-twitter-advertising\">ending all paid\nadvertising on the site</a> in response to the proliferation of\nhate speech?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also yesterday, Twitter iOS engineer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/niw/status/1664414700984242177\">Yoshimasa Niwa resigned</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I just sent that email.</p>\n\n<p>-- numstat gives me these numbers. <br />\n+ 728752, - 263722</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One former Twitter colleague told me, “This is a big deal. One of the few (8?) remaining iOS engineers at Twitter. Yoshi has been at the company for something like 14 years and is one of the very best iOS engineers I know — maybe one of the best in the world.” Until yesterday <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoshimasaniwa/\">Niwa had been at Twitter since 2010</a>, and thus may well have been the longest-standing employee in the entire company. He’d worked at Twitter for more time cumulatively than Jack Dorsey. That “numstat” nerdery reveals the number of lines of source code Niwa had added and removed over his tenure — just short of one million in total.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> In recent weeks Niwa published <a href=\"https://github.com/niw/AlpacaChat\">AlpacaChat</a>, an open-source Swift library to run the Alpaca-LoRA LLM locally on Macs and iOS devices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 3 June:</strong> Adam Singer, a Twitter engineer for 8 years, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/printf/status/1664874821736620032\">resigned today</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/02/weird-sad-twitter\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e82b1f4e9d77447fe698e3e3dc4689686470a214424a9c32634ca3a44006b05e","category":"Tech"}
