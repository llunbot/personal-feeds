Words spoken by therapists the world over and probably thought by <a href=\"/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> after Stage 10, which saw <a href=\"/tags/team-dsm\" target=\"_blank\">Team DSM</a>'s Michael Storer take his second stage win of this year's <a href=\"/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a> team leader may have ended up losing the red jersey anyway thanks to the huge breakaway making big time gains over the main field, but Roglič's desire to put more time into his GC rivals ultimately didn't help his cause.</p>\n<p>He attacked on the incline of the category two Puerto de Almáchar climb to distance his rivals and light up the stage into Rincón De La Victoria. It looked easy for him to leave rivals in his dust. It proved harder for him to stay upright on the descent, however.</p>\n<p>The risks he was taking were obvious to anyone watching. Watching him weaving and winding down the climb, you would be forgiven for believing this was the final stage of the Grand Tour and mere seconds separated him from the top stop on the podium. But after blowing the peloton to pieces through his pace and causing <a href=\"/tags/team-ineos\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>’ <a href=\"/tags/egan-bernal\" target=\"_blank\">Egan Bernal</a> and Adam Yates to be dropped, Roglič undid all his hard work by sliding out on a corner during the descent.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10035/how-to-watch-tour-of-britain-tv-coverage-2021\">How to watch Tour of Britain: TV Coverage 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nCameras suddenly cut to the Slovenian picking up his bike at the side of the road. The advantage he had built to Enric Mas, Miguel Ángel López and Jack Haig disappeared in the blink of an eye and Roglič was back ridng with those he'd previously dropped with ease, and that was that. No more risks that day.</p>\n<p>But as he said afterwards, ‘No risk, no glory.’</p>\n<p>For Storer it was a second win in four stages after his success on Stage 7, while the red jersey is now on the shoulders of Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux’s Odd Christian Eiking, the spoils of him breaking away with 30 other riders. It also raises the question of when the breakaway becomes the peloton and the peloton becomes the gruppetto and the gruppetto questions all their life decisions.</p>\n<p>Roglič now sits third on GC, 2’17” behind Eiking.</p>\n<p>Check out our gallery of photographer Chris Auld's best images from the day:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10018/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-10-gallery#13\"><p><span>Image 14 of</span> 38</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage10-2003.jpg?itok=Y_mcHaUz\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 14 of </span>38</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10018/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-10-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 10 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>25 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10018%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-10-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2010%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10018%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-10-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2010%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10018%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-10-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2010%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10018%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-10-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10018/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-10-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 38</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage10-2284.jpg?itok=86qtnhfH\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e721b176a80335f593f76dc84b344f4714f13208279917481d50e682ace73b80","category":"Cycling"}
