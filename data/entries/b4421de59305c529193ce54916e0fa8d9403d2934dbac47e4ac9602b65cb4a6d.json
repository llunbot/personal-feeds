The first of several public hearings on the application is being held today by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which is considering AT&amp;T's request. An evidentiary hearing has been <a href=\"https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M521/K754/521754881.PDF\">scheduled</a> for April, and a proposed decision is expected in September.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T has said it won't cut off phone service immediately, but ending the COLR obligation would make it easier for AT&amp;T to drop its phone lines later on. AT&amp;T's application said it would provide basic phone service in all areas for at least six months and indefinitely in areas without any alternative voice service.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001432#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001432&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4421de59305c529193ce54916e0fa8d9403d2934dbac47e4ac9602b65cb4a6d","category":"Tech"}
