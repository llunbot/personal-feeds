While wildly light premium bike builds are most often left to the dedicated weight weenie with time on their hands and money to burn, Bike Ahead is making it easier to get a killer lightweight mountain bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new The Frame HT builds aren’t exactly affordable, but in a world where you can easily spend $5000-15,000€ on a stock carbon XC bike from the likes of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=s-works\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=trek+mountain+bike\" target=\"_blank\">Trek</a>, maybe a 5000-8500€ hardtail made in Germany isn’t so far-fetched!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike Ahead The Frame HT complete hardtail mountain bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-HT-complete-hardtail-mountain-bikes_headtube-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-HT-complete-hardtail-mountain-bikes_headtube-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bike Ahead The Frame HT complete hardtail mountain bikes, headtube detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-HT-complete-hardtail-mountain-bikes_headtube-detail-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-HT-complete-hardtail-mountain-bikes_headtube-detail-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-HT-complete-hardtail-mountain-bikes_headtube-detail-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-HT-complete-hardtail-mountain-bikes_headtube-detail-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Bike Ahead Composites)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike Ahead says their new 8kg Bike Ahead The Frame HT complete hardtails are basically the lightest production mountain bikes that you can buy.

This is the type of bike that will change how you ride off-road, glancing off rocks &amp; rocketing up climbs like you never have. In fact, 8 kilograms is still just one of Bike Ahead’s lighter complete bikes, still with a 120mm fork for Trail riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with plenty of options &amp; upgrades available, you can easily shed more weight if your wallet allows. They claim the lightest complete build weighs 7.85kg with the options outlined below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where did it come from?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-edited.webp\" alt=\"Bike Ahead The Frame lightweight affordable carbon XC hardtail made in Portugal, made by Carbon Team\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-edited.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-edited-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-edited-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-edited-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-edited-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bike-Ahead-The-Frame-lightweight-carbon-XC-hardtail-made-in-Portugal-by-Carbon-Team-edited-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Frame itself was several years in development, as Bike Ahead collaborated with Carbon Team to bring premium carbon bike manufacturing back to Europe, since just before the pandemic.
