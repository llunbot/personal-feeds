The best part about this move into apparel is PNW has carried over its approach to making affordable goods. The Lander jacket is only $149 and features a hood that will fit a helmet, along with a massive back pocket, eliminating the need for a backpack or hip bag. Like all PNWC products, the Lander jacket comes with a lifetime warranty, meaning they will cover any failure due to a manufacturing defect and will repair or replace it, at their discretion, without charge to the original owner.</p>\n<p>See more details of the Lander Jacket at <a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/products/lander-jacket?variant=39267025092685\" target=\"_blank\">PNW Components</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d28f1492d813279f8b20563b01965a6f8f7dbca4fc062d29899a5786fd17c29b","category":"Cycling"}
