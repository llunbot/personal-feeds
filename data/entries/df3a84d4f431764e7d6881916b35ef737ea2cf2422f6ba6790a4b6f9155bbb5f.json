The rocket successfully boosted NASA's asteriod test mission into orbit. If all goes well, the DART spacecraft will collide with a small asteroid next October.</p>\n<p>Shortly after launch, the rocket's first stage made a successful landing on the <em>Of Course I Still Love You</em> drone ship. Including Falcon Heavy boosters, this was SpaceX's 95th successful first stage landing, and its 72nd at sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Original post</strong>: Weather permitting, a Falcon 9 rocket will launch a key asteroid-deflection mission for NASA on Tuesday night from California. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART mission, will seek to demonstrate the capability to change an asteroid's orbit next year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815277#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815277&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df3a84d4f431764e7d6881916b35ef737ea2cf2422f6ba6790a4b6f9155bbb5f","category":"Tech"}
