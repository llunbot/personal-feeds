By 2024, we all assumed, a household’s entire collection of tech products would fit into a matchbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any event, it didn’t quite work out that way, which is often the case when you assume current trends will carry on endlessly in the same direction. An iPod nano is an appreciably more portable and convenient product than an iPod mini, but that doesn’t mean we’d get the same benefits from an iPod pico the size of a kidney bean or an iPod femto the size of a grain of rice. There’s a point where getting smaller stops being helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone is a case in point. Our 90s friend would be baffled to discover that the iPhone 16 is taller, wider, and more than an ounce heavier than the original iPhone that came out 17 years earlier—but this is more than compensated for by the much larger screen and battery, and the arsenal of vastly upgraded tech components. Apple’s smartphones have got slimmer, but in other respects, it makes functional sense for them to stay the same size or grow. A 6.1-inch screen is just demonstrably more useful than a 3.5-inch one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it hasn’t been a simple march upward in size, and Apple has experimented with smaller handsets from time to time. For a couple of generations, the iPhone SE was popular among folk who didn’t especially want or need a phablet. (Now <em>there’s</em> an ugly neologism you don’t hear anymore, mainly because big smartphones are no longer a novelty.) But was it <em>really</em> the small size that was the attraction, or was it the low price and the Home button? The evidence suggests the latter, because the small but mighty iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini, as popular as they were with reviewers, were so commercially unsuccessful that Apple killed off the line in favor of something bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I loved (and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677153/apple-breakfast-rip-iphone-12-mini.html\">mourned</a>) the iPhone 12 mini because it seemed miraculous that something so small could contain such a formidable set of specs and features. I loved how unobtrusively it slipped into a pocket, and the lack of compromises its petite form factor appeared to entail. But the problem comes when a user goes from a 5.4-inch screen to a 6.1-inch one, or vice versa. I switched from the iPhone 14 Pro to the 15 Plus last fall and can confirm from <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2485466/i-upgraded-to-the-iphone-16-plus-and-i-have-thoughts.html\">personal experience</a> that once you try a bigger screen, it’s very difficult to go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps this explains the situation of the iPad mini, which once seemed like the future of the line (following that same 90s logic, I suppose) but quickly became its pariah instead. Apple eventually updated the iPad mini last month, but this came after an astonishing three years in the wilderness and involved <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2492627/the-worst-things-come-to-apple-fans-who-wait.html\">precious few worthwhile upgrades</a>: one imagines that Apple spent a lot of that time giving serious thought to mercy-killing the iPad mini like the iPhone mini before it. The device is apparently popular in some professional applications, but I’m not sure there are enough doctors and airline pilots in the world to make it commercially viable when everyone else wants to watch movies on a screen at least the size of the 10th-gen iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does shrinking tech products ever make sense? Of course. Apple’s own Mac mini, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2504694/the-mac-mini-finally-lives-up-to-its-name.html\">now smaller than ever</a>, is the most recent poster child for the mini concept and has proven a great and enduring success. Mainly, I suspect, because the Mac being mini doesn’t require the display to follow suit. It’s one of the few products in Apple’s ecosystem where the screen is unbundled from the rest of the device… and it helps that it’s plugged in rather than battery-powered, so being smaller doesn’t necessitate a reduction in functional life. The two big downsides of smallness don’t affect the Mac mini. (Another such example is the HomePod mini.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, then, would it look like if Apple tried to mini-fy one of its other products? What would a MacBook mini, for example, look like? Well, we don’t really have to guess because Apple actually used to sell a smaller MacBook Air <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667335/macbook-air-11-inch-early-2015-review.html\">with an 11-inch display</a>… and the fact that it doesn’t anymore suggests this isn’t the optimal laptop form factor. Even in 2015, we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667335/macbook-air-11-inch-early-2015-review.html\">concluded</a> that the screen was too small, although in fairness this was more a function of the extremely thick bezels than the limitations of the chassis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2025 MacBook mini would fix that issue, at any rate. And if we’re committing to the miniature concept then we can assume that the chassis would shrink inwards to meet the screen, rather than the screen expanding to meet the edge of the chassis. That would give us an unprecedentedly slim and portable laptop that would fit in Steve Jobs’ manilla envelope with room to spare for a packed lunch, which isn’t an unappealing thought. Chuck in an M3 processor and support for Apple Intelligence, and the MacBook mini would deliver high-class performance in an ultraportable package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some problems <em>are</em> fundamental to a device’s size. No matter how much we slim down those bezels, the screen can’t get any bigger than the chassis allows. More importantly, neither can the keyboard, which is bad news for people with human-sized hands and a desire to type. And if you’re one of the few people willing to stomach a laptop with a small screen and a small keyboard, there’s already the option to buy an 11-inch iPad Air with a Magic Keyboard and get two products in one. But I’d recommend you steer clear of the iPad mini.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.
