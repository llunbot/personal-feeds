For a whopping $28,900.00 USD, you could throw your leg over this <a href=\"https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/magazine/articles/louis-vuitton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Louis Vuitton</a> by <a href=\"https://maisontamboite.fr/en/accueil-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Maison Tamboite</a> city bike. The frameset is made by Maison Tamboite, a Paris-based builder that has been making bikes in-house since 1912.

Each model comes with LV monogram leather features.</p>\n<p>See the whole collection at <a href=\"https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/magazine/articles/louis-vuitton-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Louis Vuitton</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"21f78a1815bc01b69f08c7ff90e4bdc827ef01123f95602bbd9dd1b517b575ac","category":"Cycling"}
