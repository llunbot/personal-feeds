This new design seems to be somewhat reminiscent of the rear camera unit of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> X and ‌iPhone‌ XS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/12-9-ipad-air-render-front.jpg\" width=\"3625\" height=\"1801\" />\r<br />\nOn the front of the tablet, the ‌iPad Air‌ looks very similar to the current 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, but with noticeably thicker bezels, just like how the 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ has thicker borders around the display compared to the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device is expected to be targeted at those who want a bigger tablet than the current, 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌, but have no need for the high-end features of the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ such as ProMotion or a LiDAR scanner. This is similar to Apple's approach with the 13.6- and 15.3-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, as well as the 6.1-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and 6.7-inch ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>91Mobiles</em> also reiterated reports that the next-generation ‌iPad Air‌ will feature the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip. The device is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/\">rumored to enter production</a> in the first quarter of 2024, so it could already be underway. It is expected to launch \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/\">early</a>\" this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/\">likely in March</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/\">91Mobiles</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/\">Next-Gen iPad Air With 12.9-Inch Display and Redesigned Camera Unit Revealed in CAD Renders</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders.2416895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e97c1b2468768442055d3926d0a57e74756e95621d5c2edf598e2650915f10c8","category":"Apple"}
