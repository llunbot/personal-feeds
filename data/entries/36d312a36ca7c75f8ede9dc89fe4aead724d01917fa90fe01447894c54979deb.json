By linking to cdn.polyfill[.]io, websites could ensure that devices using legacy browsers could render content in newer formats. The free service was popular among websites because all they had to do was embed the link in their sites. The code hosted on the polyfill site did the rest.</p>\n<h2>The power of supply-chain attacks</h2>\n<p>In February, China-based company Funnull acquired the domain and the GitHub account that hosted the JavaScript code. On June 25, researchers from security firm Sansec <a href=\"https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack\">reported</a> that code hosted on the polyfill domain had been changed to redirect users to adult- and gambling-themed websites. The code was deliberately designed to mask the redirections by performing them only at certain times of the day and only against visitors who met specific criteria.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035216#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035216&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"36d312a36ca7c75f8ede9dc89fe4aead724d01917fa90fe01447894c54979deb","category":"Tech"}
