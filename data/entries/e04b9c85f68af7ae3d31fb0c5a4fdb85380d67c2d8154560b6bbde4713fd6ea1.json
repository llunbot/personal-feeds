Michael Brewer negotiated distribution rights for Apple in the UK in 1979, and the manual had a personal message inside. \"Julian, your generation is the first to grow up with computers. Go change the world! Steven Jobs, 1980,\" read Jobs' note.<blockquote>Julian recalls, \"I was sitting in my bedroom writing games on my Apple II when Dad called me down to meet some guests. To my amazement it was Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula. I had the manual with me and only later understood how rare it was for Jobs to sign anything, let alone to write an inscription like this. He got on well with Dad, so I feel the inscription was made with care.\"</blockquote>RR Auctions, the site that sold the Apple II manual, also <a href=\"https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/auction-details/615?page=1&amp;itemQty=24&amp;view=gallery&amp;sort=hp&amp;cat=0\">auctioned off</a> other Steve Jobs memorabilia that fetched high prices.
