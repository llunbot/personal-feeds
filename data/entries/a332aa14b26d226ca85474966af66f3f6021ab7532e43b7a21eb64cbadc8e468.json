And they have\ndone so decisively, and with their eyes wide open.</p>\n\n<p>Donald J. Trump will be our next president, elected with a\nmajority of the popular vote, likely winning both more votes and\nmore states than he did in his two previous elections. After\neverything — after his chaotic presidency, after January 6th,\nafter the last year in which the mask was increasingly off, and no\nattempt was made to hide the extremism of the agenda or the\nugliness of the appeal — the American people liked what they saw.\nAt a minimum, they were willing to accept what they saw.</p>\n\n<p>And Trump was running against a competent candidate who ran a good\ncampaign to the center and bested him in a debate, with a strong\neconomy. Yet Trump prevailed, pulling off one of the most\nremarkable comebacks in American political history. Trump boasted\nlast night, “We’ve achieved the most incredible political thing,”\nand he’s not altogether wrong. [...]</p>\n\n<p>So: We can lament our situation. We can analyze how we got here.\nWe can try to learn lessons from what has happened. We have to do\nall these things.</p>\n\n<p>But we can’t only do those things. As Churchill put it: “In\nDefeat: Defiance.” We’ll have to keep our nerve and our principles\nagainst all the pressure to abandon them. We’ll have to fight\npolitically and to resist lawfully. We’ll have to do our best to\nlimit the damage from Trump. And we’ll have to lay the groundwork\nfor future recovery.</p>\n\n<p>To do all this, we’ll have to constitute a strong opposition and a\nloyal opposition, loyal to the Declaration and the Constitution,\nloyal to the past achievements and future promise of this nation,\nloyal to what America has been and should be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/06/kristol-in-defeat-defiance\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a332aa14b26d226ca85474966af66f3f6021ab7532e43b7a21eb64cbadc8e468","category":"Tech"}
