Apple is required to comply with the law by March 6.</p>\n<p>Apple said the change is necessitated by a requirement to let developers \"use alternative browser engines—other than WebKit—for dedicated browser apps and apps providing in-app browsing experiences in the EU.\" Apple explained its stance in a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#dev-qa\">developer Q&amp;A</a> under the heading, \"Why don't users in the EU have access to Home Screen web apps?\" It says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Addressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen web apps. And so, to comply with the DMA's requirements, we had to remove the Home Screen web apps feature in the EU.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will still be possible to add website bookmarks to iPhone and iPad home screens, but those bookmarks would take the user to the web browser instead of a separate web app. The change was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/\">recently rolled out</a> to beta versions of iOS 17.4.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004114#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004114&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9428907ac51cfee5923e963e9ece0cb477a40e4ca092b184268b84717d3aa824","category":"Tech"}
