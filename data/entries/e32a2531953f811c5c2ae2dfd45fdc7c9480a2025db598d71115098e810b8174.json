Revel Bikes as it currently stands is closing its doors. Regrettably, though we have tried every avenue possible, we have exhausted all options and run out of funds to support the business. This decision comes at a critical juncture for our capital requirements, and we cannot weather this one alone. Our circumstance is tough, though not unique in the market, with product delays, significant payments coming due and a very soft market. We are on the ledge and we lost our safety net as a result of continued losses with no end in sight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-30.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-30.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-11.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-11.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Consequently, we have transferred responsibility of the business to the Bank, which currently holds the senior debt position. Unfortunately, their position and that of other senior creditors is such that there is unlikely to be any remaining funds for unsecured creditors, with over $8MM in secure credit. We are now in an orderly wind down. What does that mean? We will do our best with a limited number of people to liquidate the remaining assets that Revel has. Beyond that, I honestly do not know. What I do know is that you all deserve better than this, I am sorry that it got this far. I will do whatever I can to support you as this unfolds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I want to be open to the potential that Revel could be revived to a bigger and brighter future if a new owner comes in while we are going through the wind-down process. This is a talented team with a great brand, someone might want to buy out the debt and see this through. That said, I must be realistic and transparent with all of you – I do not know what will happen from here and we are going to have limited time. Take care of yourself and your teammates, do what is right for you and I will do whatever I can to help.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-88b.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-88b.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-88b.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-88b.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Starting tomorrow Revel Bikes will be discounted 40%-50% on all remaining product. We have worked in the ability to give you all 10% Margin on these bikes if you choose to take any more product. We can not offer terms at this time. Warranty support as we know it will cease, but we are looking for a partner to take our remaining stock to continue to support Revel bikes in the wild. We also will have a slew of left over products that we can get into your hands if desired.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-86.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-86.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-86.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/A-Revel-Bikes-Tirade-Hardtail-Review-86.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If you have open A/R we have the ability to give a discount based on when the product was sold.
