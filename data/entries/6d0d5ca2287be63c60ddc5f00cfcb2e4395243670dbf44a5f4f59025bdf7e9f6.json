{"title":"Lower-End Apple Silicon Macs With 10-Core M4 Chip to Fully Support Two External Displays","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/m4-chip-two-external-displays/","date":1730150328000,"content":"In addition to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">new iMac</a> with the 10-core M4 chip being the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/10-core-m4-imac-supports-8k-display-at-120hz/\">first-ever Mac with support for up to an 8K external display at 120Hz</a>, the computer also supports up to two 6K external displays at 60Hz. That's a very notable upgrade, as lower-end Apple silicon Macs like the MacBook Air, entry-level MacBook Pro, and previous iMac models have mostly been limited to a single external display, at least on an official basis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays.jpg\" width=\"1723\" height=\"969\" />\r<br />\nTwo exceptions are the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip, which support up to two external displays, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/macos-sonoma-14-6-dual-display-support/\">only when the laptop's lid is closed</a>. Another exception is the Mac mini, which has an HDMI port for connecting a second display. DisplayLink adapters have also been a viable solution for multiple external displays ever since the first Apple silicon Macs with the M1 chip launched in 2020.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut the 10-core M4 chip is notable in that it will bring proper support for two external displays to more lower-end Macs for the first time since Apple silicon launched, without any special tricks required. No more DisplayLink adapters, and no needing to have the MacBook's lid closed. That's a significant, long-awaited advancement for Apple silicon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHigher-end Apple silicon Macs have supported multiple external displays since the MacBook Pro models with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips launched in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements/\">expected to announce</a> a new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the 10-core M4 chip this week, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/macbook-pro-m4-two-external-displays/\">alleged leak</a> already confirmed that the laptop will support two external displays with the lid open. Next year, the M4 chip should expand to the MacBook Air, and 10-core configurations should likewise support two external displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iMac is available to pre-order now, and it launches on Friday, November 8.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/m4-chip-two-external-displays/\">Lower-End Apple Silicon Macs With 10-Core M4 Chip to Fully Support Two External Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lower-end-apple-silicon-macs-with-10-core-m4-chip-to-fully-support-two-external-displays.2441190/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d0d5ca2287be63c60ddc5f00cfcb2e4395243670dbf44a5f4f59025bdf7e9f6","category":"Apple"}
