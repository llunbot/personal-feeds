Mips is probably what set it off. A group of Swedish scientists realized that, not only are non-linear, “oblique” impacts more common than straight-on impacts, they actually can be more dangerous. If the brain rotates sharply in response to sudden angular deceleration, it can do much more damage than just bumping up against the inside of the skull. So, helmets started showing up with yellow plastic slip-planes and price tags about $20 higher than ones without.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00131_OskarOberg.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00131_OskarOberg.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00131_OskarOberg.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00131_OskarOberg.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00131_OskarOberg.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00563_PeterWengstrom.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00563_PeterWengstrom.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00563_PeterWengstrom.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00563_PeterWengstrom.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/DSC00563_PeterWengstrom.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Then competing oblique-impact protection measures hit the scene, and Mips followed suit with new iterations of its own. Then came efforts to mitigate low-intensity impacts, which we’ve learned cause their own types of long-term damage. Testing methods got more complex, and more testers joined the fight. All the while, mountain biking is getting more popular, and mountain <i>bikes</i> are getting faster.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-7.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-7.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/2024-Revel-Rascal-Review-7.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/YT-Jeffsy-Core-2-Review-30.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/YT-Jeffsy-Core-2-Review-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/YT-Jeffsy-Core-2-Review-30.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/YT-Jeffsy-Core-2-Review-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/YT-Jeffsy-Core-2-Review-30.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The result (at least we hope) has been safer helmets. Safer, more <i>expensive</i> helmets. But I wanted to take a close look at what’s happening in the middle. I’ve spent most of this ongoing renaissance in high-end models. How low could I go if I wanted to stay fancy? After looking around, I arrived at the number $150 … and immediately bumped it up to $170. That seemed to cast a wide net across some stellar models, all of which meet a few loose criteria.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-02.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-02.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-02.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-02.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-12.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-12.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>There were a couple basic deal-breakers. A helmet had to be available in at least three sizes. A couple otherwise promising entrants were only available in two sizes. Also, it couldn’t have the original-style Mips liner. These thin polycarbonate sheets do seem plenty effective, but I’ve found that they’re more likely than other oblique-impact protection measures to trap heat and compromise fit. A helmet had to either have its own novel oblique-impact protection method, or it had to use what most helmet brands call “Mips Evolve,” whose slip-plane material is integrated into the “occipital harness,” the fit dial at the base of the back of the helmet. These tend to be more form-fitting and can be more skeletal to keep from blocking vents.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-05.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-05.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-05.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-05.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-05.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-04.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-04.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-04.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-04.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-04.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Bonus points for other features, like innovative material, multiple-density foam, or gadgets like magnetic Fidlock buckles or camera / light mounts. Let me know if you think I missed any, but each of these eight helmets, ranging from $110 to $170, all seemed to fit the bill. I’ll compare comfort and fit as objectively as I can. I came up with something I’ll call the “basketball / football index,” which is how round versus oblong I found a helmet’s fit to be. A “1” means a helmet is more basketball, “3” means more football, and “2” is right between. I’ll also talk about helmet depth, occipital harness adjustability, and strap management.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-54.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-54.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-54.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-54.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-53.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-53.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-53.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-53.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-53.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I won’t go too much into ventilation. In this range, they’re all pretty good. A couple stood out for better or worse, which I’ll mention, but most were just fine. When heat really matters, I’m usually going less than five miles an hour uphill. Ask someone who rides their mountain bike on flat ground if you want to know which one ventilates better. I also won’t make definitive judgements on which helmet is safest. I’ll discuss each one’s safety features, but that’s really just a game of trust in the end. What I’m most interested in is which of these helmets are the most pleasant to use. Which ones offer that high-price swagger on a mid-range budget. To some extent, all of these helmets do, but each in its own way. This was a fun one, so let’s get started!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-40.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-40.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-40.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-40.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-40.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.giro.com/p/montaro-mips-ii-bike-helmet/100000000500000117.html\">Giro Montaro Mips II $160.00</a></h3>\n<p>Giro’s current high-end helmet lineup is partly why I put this test together. Their flagship trail MTB helmet is the Manifest, featuring the very comfortable, nearly invisible, and (I trust) very effective Mips Spherical system. But it costs $260. And I totally get it. Mips Spherical is a marvelous concept, but it can’t be done for cheap. Not long ago, the much more traditional Montaro Mips was good enough for Giro’s top spot. And this one is the <i>sequel</i>. It’s gotta be even better!</p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Oblique impact protection: Mips Evolve</li>\n<li>Traditional chin buckle</li>\n<li>Three-position visor</li>\n<li>Four sizes</li>\n<li>Basketball / football scale: 2</li>\n<li>424 grams (LG)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of the criteria I had in mind is missing on the Montaro, aside from maybe a Fidlock buckle. There’s Mips Evolve, there’s clean strap management, there’s crisp visor adjustment. There’s even an included breakaway Gopro mount, matched only by the Endura. What really stands out, for lack of a better word, is how “sleek” it is. Ever since the aggressive half-shell overthrew the cross-country teardrop, we’ve become more and more tolerant of angular, voluminous helmet shapes. Holding the Montaro in my hands, only the Smith Engage Mips shares its chill. It’s just, like, a normal helmet.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-38.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-38.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-39.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-39.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-39.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-39.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-36.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-36.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-36.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-36.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-37.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-37.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-37.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-37.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-37.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>That extends to the fit as well. The rest of these helmets, with the exception of the Leatt and Endura, all feel especially deep. I happen to really <i>like</i> deep helmets, but I understand when it can go too far. Some POC helmets, for example, crowd above my ears and eyebrows in a way that’s almost claustrophobic, and doesn’t seem to add any more protection. The Montaro sits high, without feeling like it sits <i>too</i> high. That, combined with a neutral basketball-football index, makes it one of the more “barely there” helmets in the mix.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-35.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-35.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-35.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-35.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-35.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-86.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-86.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-86.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-86.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-86.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-85.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-85.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-85.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-85.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-85.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Really, my only complaint about the Montaro is that the RocLoc occipital harness’s height adjustment often needed <i>re-adjusting,</i> If it was tilted back a bit too far while donning, it would hit my neck and click up to a shallower setting. It’s just as easy to move back down, and it never moved while riding. Not a highlight, but not a big deal. It only sticks out because of how much this helmet blends in.

WaveCel’s plastic matrix might seem similar to Koroyd, featured on Smith, Endura and other helmets. But it behaves quite differently in a crash. Much of the goal behind WaveCel was to provide the sort of oblique-impact protection that Mips first got us thinking about. And that makes sense if you’ve ever poked around in a WaveCel hemet. While Koroyd is rigidly affixed inside the helmet, WaveCel is slightly more free-floating. Not in a way that you can feel when wearing it, and it certainly doesn’t “rattle around” in there. But you can flex it with your fingers. And in an impact, it will readily crumple and slide in just about any direction, all without the need for an extra slip-plane structure.</p>\n<h3>Quick hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Oblique impact protection: WaveCel</li>\n<li>Traditional chin buckle</li>\n<li>Cam-lock strap junction adjustment</li>\n<li>Two-position visor</li>\n<li>Four sizes (51 – 66 cm)</li>\n<li>Basketball / football index: 1</li>\n<li>420 grams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though Trek / Bontrager have walked back some of their more <i>specific</i> claims about WaveCel’s protectiveness, it’s hard to deny there could be something to this stuff. I say that because I actually understand how it works. Again, the science around brain injuries is still developing. Even the experts don’t yet know everything about every type of brain injury. So, I like it when a safety feature applies to common sense.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-14.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-14.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-15.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-15.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-15.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-13.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-13.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Though I’ve heard some people with thin hair complain about feeling WaveCel’s sharp edges through their scalp, that wasn’t an issue for me. The only way it impacted comfort was its tendency to inhibit crossbreeze. I never felt it cool off with speed. But I think more importantly, I never felt it build up heat <i>without</i> speed. Heat seemed to radiate out just fine on the climbs. It also inhibited my ability to Voile strap my helmet to my handlebar, but I know I’m an outlier there.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-03.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-03.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-03.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-03.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-80.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-80.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-80.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-80.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-80.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-79.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-79.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-79.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-79.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-79.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I did have some comfort issues with the shape. The basketball-leaning inner profile led to hotspots in the front and back of my football-leaning head. Of course, that’s personal, but it stood out among all these helmets, so it’s a bit on the far end of that index. Otherwise, the Rally’s fit is carefully thought-out. I’m personally a fan of cam-lock strap adjustment under the ears. They tend to stay put when dangling the helmet on handlebars or pack straps. And the occipital retention dial is actually a Boa brand. It’s got a satisfying click and fine adjustment steps.</p>\n<p>It’s also impressively light, especially given the large WaveCel panel. That panel is concentrated towards the front, which I noticed slightly magnified the strain on my neck and forehead, but I’m really stretching for critiques at this point. If the shape works with your head, and if safety is your main priority, this one should be high on your list.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-coverage WaveCel</li>\n<li>XL size available</li>\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n<li>No Mips jiggle</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WaveCel limits certain helmet-portage options</li>\n<li>Wide / round heads only</li>\n<li>Noticeably less ventilation at speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bontrager?clear=true\">Bontrager</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-47.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-47.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-47.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-47.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/engage-mips%C2%AE-mtb-helmet/E007573OE6165.html\">Smith Engage Mips $130</a></h3>\n<p>Though Smith didn’t develop Koroyd, it’s the first brand I ever saw use it. The space-station-like Forefront was known for the honeycomb structure—often in bright green—peeking through the vents. Smith has since brought it down to some lower-priced models, limiting the Koroyd to the areas just above the temples. This is where impacts are most dangerous. The round front of the skull is better at distributing impact force, and also will crumple helmet material better. But the flatter sides of the skull are more likely to transfer forces directly to the brain, and can not crumple a helmet as well because the force isn’t as concentrated. So, the sides of the head are good places to put it.</p>\n<h3>Quick hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Oblique impact protection: Mips Evolve</li>\n<li>Koroyd panels above temples</li>\n<li>Traditional chin buckle</li>\n<li>Cam-lock strap junction adjustment</li>\n<li>Four sizes (51 – 65 cm)</li>\n<li>Basketball / football index: 3</li>\n<li>445g (XL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other than that, the Engage Mips is a pretty traditional helmet. And like the Giro Montaro, it doesn’t have an aggressively enduro shape. It’s got a normal chin buckle and normal adjustable strap junctions. But I think this was my second favorite helmet in the test. To be fair, much of that is simply the fit. Smith just knows my head type, and the Engage is perfect for it. There were no hot spots, and no need to get too aggressive with the occipital tension to keep it feeling secure. It’s also slightly deeper-feeling than the Montaro, which I liked. And I could have made it feel even deeper if I wanted.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-44.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-44.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-44.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-44.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-45.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-45.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-45.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-45.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-45.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-42.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-42.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-42.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-42.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-42.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-46.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-46.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-46.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-46.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-46.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This was one of only two helmets that i did not adjust the occipital harness as low as possible. And speaking of which, that adjustment was pretty unique. Instead of being anchored to the helmet itself, it’s anchored to the Mips Evolve liner. That helped complete Mips Evolve’s ability to make for a hat-like fit. There’s zero interruption across the surface of the helmet actually sitting against my head. Not something I noticed when the helmet stayed still, but it made re-adjustments easier. And despite this being a close second for the heaviest helmet in the test, I’m guessing it helped isolate that weight from my scalp.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-43.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-43.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-43.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-43.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-74.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-74.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-74.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-74.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-74.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-73.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-73.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-73.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-73.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-73.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>But maybe most importantly, this had the least goofy-looking visor out of the group.

It is pretty difficult to adjust, but you’ll only have to do it once.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-48.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-48.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-48.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-48.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-48.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-51.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-51.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-51.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-51.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-50.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-50.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-50.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-50.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-50.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I’d put this helmet on par with Giro regarding its polish. They were the only two models with the straps anchored to the very bottom rim, which i’ve found helps limit tangles and make it slightly quicker to put on. It’s also one of just two helmets in this list (including Leatt) to add soft rubber panels to the inside surface of the occipital harness. Again, not something I need because my hair does much of the work, but I’m lucky like that.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-49.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-49.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-49.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-49.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-49.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-88.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-88.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-88.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-88.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-88.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-87.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-87.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-87.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-87.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-87.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Like the Smith, this helmet has a relatively short visor. Although I did need to keep it in its highest position to get it out of sight, I think it looked ok up there. Also up there is the only other Gopro / light mount in the mix. And along with that mount, the helmet comes with a spare pad that includes a mesh bug net, though it doesn’t really block access to your scalp. This was on the better-ventilated end of the spectrum, meaning that I actually noticed some air passing through once I was at speed, if only in the center vents. That, paired with the minimal weight, moderate depth, and smart straps, made this the helmet I thought about the least while wearing it.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Koroyd protection</li>\n<li>Short visor still looks good in high position</li>\n<li>Wide, flat under-ear strap junction</li>\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most expensive helmet in this round-up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://us.endurasport.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwncWvBhD_ARIsAEb2HW8_CaRGp2Rfks9xfAf8phKGOVbbx9uVX_i2PlrGZUqqQdRiQPl0pysaApdcEALw_wcB\">Endura</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-34.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-34.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-34.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://lazersport.us/products/coyotekineticore\">Lazer Coyote KinetiCore $109.99</a></h3>\n<p>I almost didn’t include this helmet. One reason was that it was so far below the median pricepoint I had in mind, it almost seemed like it wouldn’t qualify. But it did check the boxes. It’s got the luxury of fidlock, widely micro-adjustable occipital occipital harness height, and a novel slow-speed and rotational-impact protection system (KinetiCore) that, like Wavecel, convinced me that it’d do its job without needing to see test results.</p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Oblique impact protection: KinetiCore</li>\n<li>Fidlock chin buckle</li>\n<li>Four sizes (52 – 64 cm)</li>\n<li>Basketball / football index: 1</li>\n<li>436 grams (LG)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The other reason I almost didn’t include it is because the visor kept flopping down in hard hits.

It makes the helmet easier to crumple and deform in multiple directions. Kali has done something similar in some models, but embeds it in a dual-density foam. Lazer left it out in the open, which I’d reckon makes it even more effective. Or maybe it just makes me think it will be, which is good enough. It doesn’t feel any different than a traditional helmet when you’re wearing it. And though the wide padding limits air circulation in some spots, and ventilation was only noticeable at speed, the KinetiCore concept naturally allows for more air flow.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-29.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-29.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-29.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-78.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-78.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-78.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-78.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-78.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-77.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-77.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-77.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-77.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-77.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>There just were a couple too many misses on this for me.

To the touch, the “Turbines” feel a bit like D30 rubber. They’re slow-rebounding and almost putty-like.

Leatt was first known for their neck braces, designed to prevent the neck from bending too far in a crash. It was a threat that didn’t get enough attention in action sports. Same goes for the low-speed direct impacts Turbine 360 is partly here to address. It’s a bonus benefit to offering oblique-impact protection like Mips, but without the jiggle that’s had a lot of us looking for an alternative.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-19.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-19.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-20.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-20.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-21.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-21.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-21.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-18.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-18.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Inside the helmet is a simplified version of Leatt’s “Power Bridge” structure. On their higher-end helmets, this is a unique density band of EPS, arching from ear to ear. But on the All-Mountain 3.0, it’s just integrated into the single-density structure and bound with a panel of the in-molded polycarbonate shell that’s one piece with the rear half of the helmet. The idea is to distribute impact load across the entire helmet. The effects aren’t as intuitive as Turbine 360’s, but I’ll take it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-17.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-17.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-17.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-82.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-82.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-82.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-82.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-82.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-81.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-81.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-81.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-81.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-81.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Veering out of the safety sector, the All-Mountain 3.0’s fit was the shallowest in the bunch. Again, not my ideal shape. For me, it bordered on an “on-not-in” sort of fit. But I understand why someone might appreciate a helmet that’s not bearing down their ears and glasses. And to be fair, it never moved out of place. If this were a Mips-equipped helmet, it’d likely have some pretty unsettling jiggle. But the Turbines only ought to move in an impact. And if you do need to fine-tune the fit, Leatt includes a couple thickness of top and front pads. With the thinner pads up top, the All-Mountain 3.0 feels like a normal mild-duty trail helmet. But given its moto pedigree, it’s anything but.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No Mips jiggle</li>\n<li>Despite its enduro-ready length, the visor is out of the way in the middle setting</li>\n<li>Low-speed impact protection from Turbine 360 system</li>\n<li>A little pad swap goes a long way for fine-tuning fit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not as deep-feeling as some in the test</li>\n<li>Big-visor style is a little polarizing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://leatt.com/us/explore-mtb\">Leatt</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-28.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-28.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-28.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-28.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-28.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://troyleedesigns.com/products/sp24-flowline-badge-se-helmet-w-mips-badge-olive-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">Troy Lee Flowline SE $159.99</a></h3>\n<p>The flagship A3 helmet from Troy Lee is my favorite helmet on the market right now. I don’t really consider myself a Troy Lee sort of rider, and honestly, the A3’s fit isn’t quite right for my head. But the brand has done some pretty techy stuff lately. Their apparel is actually really thoughtful. And their helmets have always been well respected. What I respect about the A3 is its dual-density construction. The inner layer of foam is a soft EPP material instead of traditional EPS, intended to soften the blow in low-speed impacts. The new Flowline helmet takes a lower-tech approach to the same idea.</p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Oblique impact protection: Mips Evolve</li>\n<li>Dual-density EPS foam</li>\n<li>Fidlock chin buckle</li>\n<li>Three sizes (53 – 63 cm)</li>\n<li>Basketball / football index: 1</li>\n<li>448 grams (XL / XXL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A step up from the $120 Flowline, the Flowline SE lines the bulk of the helmet’s inner surface with a softer EPS foam. It’s noticeably different when you push on it. There’s a more “spongy,” less “brittle” feel to it. And it’s integrated flush to the helmet structure itself, so there’s not another “layer” or anything. Just a sort of first-line of defense to start the deceleration process. The Flowline SE also gets a Fidlock buckle and fancy antimicrobial liner, as well as some more Troy-Lee-esque colorways.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-26.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-26.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-26.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-26.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-27.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-27.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-27.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-27.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-25.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-25.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-25.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-24.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-24.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-24.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Now, it may partly be because <i>this</i> colorway is mostly white, but the Flowline SE looks pretty bulky. Especially up front. The brim is pretty thick. And being that it’s the heaviest helmet in the test, that makes sense. I did find myself noticing some weight cantilevering against my forehead when I was in high-speed rough sections, but I can partly chalk that up to my head not being quite the right shape for it. The Flowline SE is on par with the Bontrager for its basketball-leaning shape. If the load were distributed more across the sides and temples, the weight and bulk would have been less noticeable.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-23.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-23.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-23.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-23.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-76.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-76.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-76.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-76.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-75.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-75.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-75.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-75.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-75.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>More than any of the helmets in this round-up, I recommend trying on a Flowline SE for size and fit if you can.

It’s a tad on the heavy side, and it doesn’t have as many compelling safety features as some others on this list. But it fits me really well. If you haven’t worn a Bell helmet for the past six or seven years, I recommend giving them a shot.

And the depth meant I didn’t need to have the occipital harness all that tight to achieve the peace of mind that everything would stay where it should.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-56.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-56.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-56.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-56.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-55.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-55.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-55.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-55.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-55.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-10.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-10.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-07.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-07.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-07.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-07.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-07.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The helmet does have at least one safety feature that hooked me. There are some subtle, shallow bumps and ridges above each temple, like little baby KinetiCores. Being the most sensitive parts of the head, that seems like it’s where they’d belong. But beyond that, it’s simply a nice and tidy package that feels top-of-the line. There’s clean strap management, a Fidlock buckle, and firm, positive snaps between visor settings, though I do have to run it in the highest setting if I don’t want it to block the view.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-06.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-06.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-06.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-06.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-06.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-84.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-84.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-84.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-84.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-84.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-83.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-83.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-83.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-83.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/affordable-high-end-helmet-round-up-review-83.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Like the Troy Lee Flowline SE, I recommend trying one of these on. I’ve known for a while that Bell helmets fit me. And before I found that A3 helmet, Bell was my brand. And I guess that’s probably as much of a factor as any safety claim. When I put on this helmet, it feels like home.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deep, secure feel</li>\n<li>That “Bell fit” is great, if it works for your head</li>\n<li>Low-speed impact protection above the temples</li>\n<li>XL size available</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deep fit may interfere with some glasses</li>\n<li>Fully out-of-the-way visor position is very high up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.bellhelmets.com/bike/?_gl=1*1nq2y04*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw0MexBhD3ARIsAEI3WHJKsqjJcGKhBAwEsXhEWJpNqSTliV87EYwG79T7jYHuGUQdM8QrclkaAgraEALw_wcB\">Bell</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Do you have any experiences with these helmets or perhaps we missed one?
