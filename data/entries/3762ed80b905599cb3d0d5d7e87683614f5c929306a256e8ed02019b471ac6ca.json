The GRC Dicut 50 rim profile is available in 700c size only, while the GRC Dicut 30 rim is also available as a 650b wheelset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a choice of hubs for each, providing six options in total. The lower spec GRC 1400 Dicut wheelset is priced at £1,864.98 and the higher spec GRC 1100 Dicut at £2,299.98. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, there’s a new HGC 1400 Spline wheelset, specifically designed for use on electric gravel bikes. This has the same 30mm deep rim as the GRC Dicut 30 with a more robust hub and extra spokes in the rear wheel. It’s priced at £1,949.98.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-sealant\">Best tubeless sealant for road and gravel bike tyres</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">Hooked vs hookless rims: Pros, cons and which is right for you</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike-upgrades\">Best gravel bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\">Buyer’s guide: The best gravel bike tyres</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-spokesmen-inside-dt-swiss\">The spokesmen: Inside DT Swiss</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Adventure or race?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"633\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DT-Swiss-GRC-rim-profiles.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DT-Swiss-GRC-rim-profiles.jpg 633w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DT-Swiss-GRC-rim-profiles-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DT-Swiss-GRC-rim-profiles-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DT-Swiss-GRC-rim-profiles-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The two gravel rim depths are designed to serve different purposes: the shallower 30mm deep rims are aimed at providing agility for adventure riding and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a>, while the deeper 50mm rims are aero optimised for aero gains and speed for faster gravel riding and gravel racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two depths have the same 24mm internal width, but while the 30mm profile has a 31mm maximum external width, the 50mm depth bulges out to 36.5mm at its widest point. DT Swiss says that the 24mm internal rim width provides optimal support and lowest drag with 40mm <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">gravel tyres</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hooked rims for safety and aerodynamics</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Rim_001_1920px.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While other brands are increasingly offering <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\" target=\"_blank\">hookless rims</a>, both new DT rims have hooked beads, following the brand’s move to return to hooks from hookless in its latest CRC wheels. DT Swiss says that it believes that hooked rims are better than hookless for safety and ease of use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also says that its modelling and wind tunnel testing suggest that hooked rims are more aero than hookless, contradicting <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-overhauls-race-performance-wheelsets-new-404-firecrest-and-454-nsw-designs\" target=\"_blank\">Zipp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/enve-updates-ses-wheelset-range\" target=\"_blank\">Enve </a>and other proponents of hookless rims. DT says that, with the launch of the new rims, its entire road and gravel wheelset range is now hooked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as low drag, DT Swiss claims that the new GRC 50 rim also has lower steering moment than a range of competitor gravel wheels – the force that is exerted on the rim by crosswinds at different <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-science-yaw-angles-explained\" target=\"_blank\">yaw angles</a>. For an off-road rider, the ability to keep a line with less effort is likely to be an important feature of a front wheel in particular. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rims are built using a patent-pending process, which DT says provides a high quality finish out of the mould without air pockets or excess resin, thus avoiding the need to lacquer them, in turn saving weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Weights and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DTSwiss_GRC_1400_30_Spokes_1920px.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can buy both rims laced to two different grades of DT Swiss hubs and with different spoke grades, with the different specs designated the GRC 1100 Dicut and the GRC 1400 Dicut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The higher spec GRC 1100 Dicut wheels have a 180 Dicut hub with a Ratchet EXP freehub with 36 points of engagement and are laced with 24 T-head spokes to prevent spoke rotation. The front wheel and rear non-drive side use DT Aerolite II spokes, with Aerolite Comp spokes in the rear wheel’s drive side. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laced to the 1100 Dicut hub, the GRC wheels have a claimed weight of 1,350g for the 30mm profile and 1,567g for the 50mm depth. That makes the GRC 1100 Dicut 30 wheelset some 252g lighter than the previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/dt-swiss-grc-1400-spline-42-wheelset-review\" target=\"_blank\">GRC 1400 Spline 42</a> gravel wheels, which we reviewed in 2021 and which are now discontinued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both depths of GRC 1100 Dicut wheels are priced at £2,299.98 / $2,990.80 / €2,499.80.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GRC 1400 Dicut wheels have a 240 Dicut hubset with the same Ratchet EXP freehub, while the 24 front and rear wheel spokes are T-head DT Aero Comp II.
