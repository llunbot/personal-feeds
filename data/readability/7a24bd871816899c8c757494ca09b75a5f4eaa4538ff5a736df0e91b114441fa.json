This is a mostly flat day before the stage-ending first-category climb of the Picón Blanco (7.6 km at 9.3%), which reaches 18% at its steepest. This climb has been used in the Vuelta a Burgos every year since 2017, but this is its first appearance in the Vuelta.</p><p>This is a tough stage just days into the race.</p><p><strong>Who’s it for</strong>: Probably GC men, but maybe the breakaway. For context, the stage 3 uphill in 2020 went to the GC men; in 2019 and 2018 the early uphill finish was won by a breakaway.</p><p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks</strong>: <em>With none of the top climbers out of the GC battle just yet so early in the race, I like the red jersey favorites for this stage, particularly the one who just proved his form with a victory in the opening time trial. Behind Primož Roglič, I like Adam Yates just as much as I like Egan Bernal. At his best, Bernal is a better climber, but Yates was good on stage 1 and he’s also a pretty explosive rider who should thrive on the very steep gradient. Also keep an eye on Romain Bardet, who looks to be in great form.</em></p></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"7a24bd871816899c8c757494ca09b75a5f4eaa4538ff5a736df0e91b114441fa","category":"Cycling"}
