Web apps could no longer launch from the ‌Home Screen‌ in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them to a simple shortcut with an option to open within Safari instead.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe move was heavily criticized by groups like <a href=\"https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/\">Open Web Advocacy</a>, which <a href=\"https://letter.open-web-advocacy.org\">started a petition</a> in an effort to persuade Apple to reverse the change, and it even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/disabled-web-apps-attract-eu-scrutiny/\">caught the attention of the European Commission</a>. Now, Apple has backtracked and says that ‌Home Screen‌ web apps that use WebKit in the EU will continue to function as expected upon the release of iOS 17.4. In an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu\">update posted on Apple's developer website</a>, the company said:<blockquote>Previously, Apple announced plans to remove the Home Screen web apps capability in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built directly on WebKit and its security architecture, and align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopers and users who may have been impacted by the removal of Home Screen web apps in the beta release of iOS in the EU can expect the return of the existing functionality for Home Screen web apps with the availability of iOS 17.4 in early March.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple previously claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/ios-17-4-web-apps-removed-apple/\">it had to make the change to how web apps work</a> in iOS to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), arguing that third-party browsers used with web apps in Europe could expose users to unlawful security and privacy risks. It believed that the adjustment would only affect a small number of users. Apple still needs to make a range of changes to its platforms in the European Union, such as allowing third-party app stores, by the DMA's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/\">deadline of March 6</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-walks-back-decision-to-disable-eu-web-apps/\">Apple Walks Back Decision to Disable Home Screen Web Apps in the EU</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-walks-back-decision-to-disable-home-screen-web-apps-in-the-eu.2420805/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f652a0cb1e6d115eb0e863f75ff3765baa914fed028fb9d8c5c9c8341058a040","category":"Apple"}
