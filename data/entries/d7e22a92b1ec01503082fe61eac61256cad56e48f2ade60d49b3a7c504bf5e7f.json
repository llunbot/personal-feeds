{"title":"Announcing HCP Vault Starter","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hcp-vault-starter","date":1627920000000,"content":"<p>We are pleased to announce a new fully managed <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/\">HashiCorp Vault</a> offering called \"Starter\" for Amazon Web Service (AWS) environments on the <a href=\"https://cloud.hashicorp.com/\">HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)</a>. The new Starter cluster is a production-grade, 3-node cluster with a feature set very similar to that of the Standard cluster, but with a limit of 25 clients. Offered at a reduced price point, it’s a great self-service option for customers with modest scale.</p>\n<p>HCP Vault allows organizations to get Vault clusters up and running quickly, get access to best-in-class secrets management and encryption capabilities, and let the platform provide resilience and operational excellence as a service. We initially launched <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-on-the-hashicorp-cloud-platform-ga\">HCP Vault general availability</a> with a Development node and Standard cluster, and gave details on the push-button deployment and fully managed infrastructure it provides.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will review some of the new features and capabilities introduced since we launched HCP Vault and lay out the pricing options for this managed service.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#pricing-and-aws-region-availability\">»</a><a></a>Pricing and AWS Region Availability</h2>\n<p>HCP Vault is generally available in AWS regions in the U.S. (Oregon and Virginia) and Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, and London). We plan to add additional region options in the U.S. and Europe, and expand to other parts of the world in the future.</p>\n<p>HCP Vault offers multiple packages at discrete price points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Development node</strong>: This is the best way to get started testing HCP Vault in AWS environments. The Development node is a non-production, single-node deployment of Vault meant for development and test workloads, billed at $0.03 per hour with up to 25 clients.</li>\n<li><strong>Starter cluster (billed hourly)</strong>: For light production workflows, we recommend provisioning a multi-node, highly available Starter cluster. This is a 3-node, highly available Vault deployment that is billed at $0.50 per hour with up to 25 clients.</li>\n<li><strong>Standard cluster (billed hourly)</strong>: For larger production workflows, we recommend provisioning a multi-node, highly available Standard cluster with increased capacity. Base prices range from $1.578 to $7.489 per hour depending on the cluster size you choose, with additional price scaling for active clients.</li>\n<li><strong>Standard cluster (billed annually)</strong>: Organizations that plan to run large production deployments on HCP Vault have the option of entering into an annual agreement with HashiCorp.
