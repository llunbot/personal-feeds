{"title":"Meet Hyperlight, Ars Technica’s new, even brighter “Light” mode","link":"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/12/meet-hyperlight-ars-technicas-new-even-brighter-light-mode/","date":1733770511000,"content":"<p>Like many sites, apps, and operating systems, Ars Technica has both \"Light\" and \"Dark\" visual styles. They look great! But even the \"Light\" mode has darker elements in it, and after our recent redesign, some Ars readers asked for an even lighter \"Light\" mode, one that would allow them to absolutely sear their own retinas with various shades of blinding white. (I kid, of course; for some readers, it's a serious visual comfort issue.)</p>\n<p>We've spent the last month working up a third visual style to give the people what they want. Behold the fully armed and operational \"Hyperlight\" mode, our new visual theme featuring a white background, light gray headline boxes, and black text. You can activate it right now from the visual style menu on the navigation bar at the top of the page.</p>\n<p>In total, we now have four visual modes. Hyperlight is the brightest of these, while Day &amp; Night is our rebranded \"Light mode\" and mixes light and dark elements. Dark is all dark backgrounds with light text. The fourth mode is System, which automatically switches between Day &amp; Night and Dark modes based on your operating system setting. (System will not switch the site to Hyperlight.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/12/meet-hyperlight-ars-technicas-new-even-brighter-light-mode/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/12/meet-hyperlight-ars-technicas-new-even-brighter-light-mode/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b8f1a7b9d760f018eb5e07dc41a093083cc97eab64148807628110e3d8a64865","category":"Tech"}
