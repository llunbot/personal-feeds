It will include several new features, including Apple Intelligence (for M1 and later models), a new Calculator app with the super-cool Math Notes feature, and the ability to customize your home screen more than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound appealing? In this article, we explain everything you need to know about updating your iPad to a new version of iPadOS. That includes the process of backing up, downloading, installing, and getting everything set up. We cover system requirements and what to do if you encounter problems (such as not having enough space or not being able to connect to Wi-Fi).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss whether it’s a good idea to install an iPadOS beta and what the difference between public and developer betas are.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Preparing for iPadOS 17</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should do a bit of iPad spring-cleaning before installing any software update: it’s very important that you <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">back up your iPad</a> before installing, because you don’t want to lose any important data. You should also spend some time <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668286/how-to-free-up-space-on-an-iphone.html\">clearing some space</a> so that you have enough storage for the new update. Newer iPads had plenty of storage, but some older models might be pushing their 32GB limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tend to store lots of movies and TV shows on our iPad, so if you need space these could be removed. As long as you downloaded them from Apple or a service you’re still subscribed to, you should be able to download them again later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing to do before you start the job of updating your iPad is to check that the new software will run on your iPad. The iPadOS 18 update runs on the following iPads: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatible iPads:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Pro (M4)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 11-inch</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (M2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (3rd gen and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (7th gen and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (5th gen and later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that if your iPad is an iPad Pro from 2016 or 2017, or a 6th-gen iPad from 2018, you’ll be stuck on iPadOS 17. Apple will still provide regular security updates for at least another year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update to iPadOS 18</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When iPadOS 18 arrives (or any subsequent iPadOS update) you will eventually get an alert on your iPad telling you that the new version is ready to download (usually after a week). If you want it right away, you’ll have to go into the Settings app to get your iPad and manually download it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>You’ll need to be connected to Wi-Fi. While it is possible to install via a cellular connection it will use up a lot of data. We advise that you check it’s a safe network – we don’t recommend you do this over hotel Wi-Fi, for instance. We have some tips on how to download iPadOS if you don’t have Wi-Fi below.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> and you’ll see the update if one is available.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the new software appears, tap <em>Download and Install</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your passcode when prompted, and agree to the terms and conditions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your device will download the update in the background. You’ll see an indication of how much time it is likely to take, though it’s just an estimate and could take longer, especially if you’re downloading it as soon as it arrives. You can use your iPad while it downloads. Once the download has finished you will receive a notification on your iPad.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now tap on <em>Install Now</em>. Your iPad will verify the update and restart. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>When it turns back on the iPad will begin installing the update. It will take several minutes, depending on the size of the update. The first version of iPadOS 18 could take longer than usual.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alternatively, you can choose to install iPadOS 18 overnight as long as it is plugged in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to download iPadOS without Wi-Fi</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install a new version of iPadOS but don’t have access to secure Wi-Fi, you might be wondering whether you can update iPadOS using cellular or mobile data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple used to have a download cap that stopped downloads of more than 200MB over a data connection. This cap was lifted in iPadOS 13, so you can now download apps of any size. Go to Settings &gt; <em>App Store</em> &gt; <em>App Downloads</em>. You can choose from <em>Ask If Over 200MB</em>, <em>Always Allow</em> or <em>Always Ask</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking of downloading this way we warn that even “unlimited'” data contracts aren’t truly unlimited—at some point, your carrier will throttle your speeds. You can also<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671125/how-to-set-up-an-iphone-hotspot.html\"> tether your iPad to your iPhone</a> to share the connection. But it’s best to just wait until you can connect to a stable Wi-Fi connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to download iPadOS via a Mac (or PC)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if your Mac happens to be connected to the internet via Ethernet, or another way, you could download iPadOS using the Finder. Plug a USB-C-to-USB-C cable into your iPad and the other end into your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Finder on your Mac and plug in your iPad.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the icon that represents your iPad.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run through the options to download and install iPadOS.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that in older versions of macOS, or Windows, iTunes manages this process instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why won’t my iPad update?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be wondering why your iPad isn’t showing the update as available. There are a few reasons why this might be the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It might not be available yet—iPadOS updated roll out quickly, but it still takes time for it to reach all devices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There could be an issue with Apple’s servers especially on release day.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your iPad might be too old to run the new version of iPadOS. See above or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2035481/how-long-does-apple-support-ipads.html\">Which version of iPadOS can I run?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You might not be connected to Wi-Fi.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If those points don’t apply to you, try installing via the Finder or iTunes as we detailed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you install the iPadOS beta?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before an update is released, Apple tests it for several weeks and anyone can join in. Running a beta is the only way to get hold of a version of iPadOS before it’s officially launched, and if you want to try out the latest features first, you might be tempted to install a copy on your iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just bear in mind that betas are not finished software. They are likely to contain bugs (looking for bugs is the main reason Apple allows the public to try the beta) and may not have all the features and interface elements that will appear in the final version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, we advise caution in grabbing the iPadOS beta and don’t recommend installing it on your main iPad if you depend on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developer vs public betas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple runs two iPadOS beta programs, one for developers and one for those who sign up as public testers. Read this for more information: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to become an Apple beta tester.</a> At any given time the developer beta will be a slightly ahead: Apple rolls out each version to devs first, and to the public afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be that the developer beta was only available to developers who paid money to Apple to join the developer program, but now the company has made it possible to download the developer beta while only being registered as a developer with a free account. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install the iPadOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be necessary to install a profile on your iPad in order to receive the beta, but since iOS 16.4 this has been unnecessary. Now, as long as you are registered, you can download the beta versions from the <em>Software Update</em> tab in Settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To install the iPadOS 18 public beta, follow these instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you aren’t already registered for the public beta, click Sign up on the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Beta page</a> and register using your Apple ID details.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in to the Beta Software Program.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click Enrol your iPadOS device. (If you signed up for a beta last year you may need to uninstall that profile and re-enrol.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now if you open Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> on your iPad you should see the beta version of iPadOS. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To install the iPadOS 18 developer beta, follow these instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you don’t already have a developer account you can get one if you sign into Xcode or on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-developer/id640199958\">Apple Developer App</a>. Just tap on Account and sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on <em>Beta Updates</em>. You should now see the iPadOS developer beta as an install option here.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>iPadOS 18 Developer Beta</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will see the Beta Update ready to install on the previous screen. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Download and Install to install the Developer Beta on your iPad. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait for your iPad to download the update, then tap Install.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p> If you want to revert back to a pre-beta version read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">How to remove an iOS beta from your iPhone</a> – the method is the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to exit the beta program</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you previously tried out a beta version of iPadOS ahead of its full release, you should note that in order to get upcoming non-beta iPadOS releases you will need to follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Updates</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on <em>Beta</em>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Beta Updates section choose <em>Off</em>. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to try out the beta again just go back to this page and choose the relevant beta version. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to go back to the old version of iPadOS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what to do if you change your mind later and want to try to downgrade to an older version of iPadOS. (Note, however, that downgrading is really tricky, so we can’t guarantee you’ll be able to revert.)</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the correct version of iPadOS for your iPad from <a href=\"https://ipsw.me/product/iPad\">IPSW.me</a>. It needs to still be signed by Apple, which these days is a very narrow window indeed. It should start downloading to your Downloads folder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On your Mac, open the Finder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plug in your iPad.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will need to turn off Find My on your device. Go to Settings and click on your ID information. Tap <em>Find My</em> &gt; <em>Find My iPad</em> and switch the slider to off. Enter your Apple ID password.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On your Mac in the Finder, hold down the Option/Alt key and click on Restore iPa. This should allow you to select the version of iPadOS you wish to install on the iPad from your downloads folder, locate it, and click on <em>Open</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A message will appear saying which version of iPadOS you will install. Click to confirm this and wait while your iPad is restored.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once your iPad boots up you can choose to restore it from a backup, but beware that if this backup is since the version of iPadOS was updated you will recover that version of iPadOS. You may be lucky enough to find an older version of your backup – tap on the devices to see what version of iPadOS they are in. You can back up using a different device’s backup, but some data may not sync.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your iPad doesn’t run the version of iPadOS you’re after, you might want to check our roundup of the \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672807/crazy-ipad-deals-for-april-2022.html\">Best iPad deals</a> so you can save money while bagging yourself a new iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c7faeab80bf2811421ea28ab0094ae2907809249a9a2d36cc6124d8787be719e","category":"Apple"}
