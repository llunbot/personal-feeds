Google says it's investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities.</p>\n<p>The covert tracking—implemented in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel/\">Meta Pixel</a> and <a href=\"https://ads.yandex/metrica\">Yandex Metrica</a> trackers—allows Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. <a href=\"https://source.Android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox\">Android sandboxing</a>, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources.

What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context. The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b5fec2840d306cef1b919d4524e1a307a45144bb978d1474f019ff684f74e03","category":"Tech"}
