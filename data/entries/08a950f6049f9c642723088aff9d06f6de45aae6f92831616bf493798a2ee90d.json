They are not designed to be serviced or repaired because no internal components can be accessed without damage to the device, making them a disposable item, especially since their three batteries degrade over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPillonel's latest tongue-in-cheek project to add wires to AirPods is designed to raise awareness about these repairability issues, encouraging consumers to think more about simply buying a non-consumable pair of wired earbuds rather than Apple's wireless offering.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, Pillonel undertook a similar project to highlight repairability issues with Apple's lightning connector by adding one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/19/engineer-added-lightning-to-samsung-phone/\">to a Samsung Galaxy A51</a>.
