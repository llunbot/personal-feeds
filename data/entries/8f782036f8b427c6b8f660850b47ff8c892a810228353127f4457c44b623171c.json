The problem is that sometimes you need to work on the go, and a bulky desktop monitor isn’t exactly fun to lug around. Good thing portable monitors have been improving so quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Glance 16-inch Portable Monitor is slim enough to take anywhere and only needs a USB-C or HDMI port to connect. It’s also usually $249, but you can get one of these monitors on sale for $149.99 here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These monitors are sleek and vibrant, with a 16-inch LCD display and a simple plug-and-play design. Just connect it to a DP-enabled Type-C port or an HDMI port. If you’re using HDMI, it’ll also need an additional USB connection for power. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with a lot of portable monitors is that they need a separate (expensive) monitor stand. This one doesn’t. The folding base doubles as an adjustable stand. It also has ports for two USB-C devices, an HDMI cable, and there’s even a 35mm audio port. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few $149.99<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/glance?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=glance&amp;utm_term=scsf-613524&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AJIzIAO&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> Glance Portable Monitors</a> left, but it may not stay that way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/glance?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=glance&amp;utm_term=scsf-613524&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AJIzIAO&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/2b3a70267283f6a58c2b35e593c1c1f9c2277717/store/63e2bcbe7ac2d45bf56524b079c8139b32c0bebe3be668207f5daba82941/sale_320782_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Glance: Portable 16″ Monitor with 1080P FHD Display – $149.99</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/glance?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=glance&amp;utm_term=scsf-613524&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003AJIzIAO&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8f782036f8b427c6b8f660850b47ff8c892a810228353127f4457c44b623171c","category":"Apple"}
