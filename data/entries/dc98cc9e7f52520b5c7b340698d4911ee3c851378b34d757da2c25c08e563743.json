A woman in her 70s, she belongs to the demographic most vulnerable to heat-related death. To her, the government’s response to recent heat waves—<a href=\"https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesund-leben/umwelt-und-gesundheit/hitze.html\" target=\"_blank\">cautioning seniors to stay in the shade during hot days</a>, for instance — seemed like a Band-Aid.
