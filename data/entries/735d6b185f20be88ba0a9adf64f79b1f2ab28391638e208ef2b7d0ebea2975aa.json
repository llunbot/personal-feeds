After the second crash of a 737 MAX aircraft in March killed all 149 passengers and eight crew members, Boeing's newest and much ballyhooed aircraft was grounded around the world. Orders were canceled. Billions of dollars were lost. Families were understandably aggrieved.

Boeing had spent the better part of a decade building its Starliner spacecraft to carry NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. It had not been easy. Long accustomed to cost-plus contracts, Boeing's space division found itself competing with SpaceX and its more nimble approach to space systems development. With a fixed-price contract, Boeing had to closely watch costs and eat any overruns. Yet Boeing had persevered, with Starliner sitting atop an Atlas V rocket.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784630#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784630&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"735d6b185f20be88ba0a9adf64f79b1f2ab28391638e208ef2b7d0ebea2975aa","category":"Tech"}
