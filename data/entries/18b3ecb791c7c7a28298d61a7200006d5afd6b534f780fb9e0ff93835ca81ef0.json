A welcome addition to their already extensive on-bike collection of bags. It’s a perfect companion to the versatile <a href=\"https://ilequipment.com/products/seat-bag-adventure\" target=\"_blank\">Seat Bag Adventure</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inside Line Equipment (ILE)  Frame Bag is US-made</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-subtle-branding.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-subtle-branding.webp\" alt=\"New Inside Line Equipment Frame Bag subtle branding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-subtle-branding.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-subtle-branding-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-subtle-branding-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-subtle-branding-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the other bags in the collection, the Frame Bag is made in Berkeley, California, from US-milled materials. The new Frame Bag sports a performance-forward design while keeping the aesthetics subtle and low-key.

This would help minimize any paint damage under the mounting points of the bag, especially if you ride in wet, muddy, or even sandy/gritty conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ILE Frame Bag Retail &amp; Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-with-drone.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-with-drone.webp\" alt=\"New Inside Line Equipment Frame Bag with drone\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-with-drone.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-with-drone-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-with-drone-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-with-drone-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Room for a drone….</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-camera-.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-camera-.webp\" alt=\"New Inside Line Equipment Frame Bag camera\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-camera-.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-camera--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-camera--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-camera--768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>…or your fave camera</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail price: $120</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Available in 12 colors and multiple fabrics, including VX21, VX25, Cordura, and Waxed Canvas</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dual-sided entry with separate organization for essentials</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secure pump sleeve and tool storage options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weatherproof construction with waterproof zippers and protective zipper flaps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multiple velcro attachment options to fit various bike sizes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frame tape at contact points is recommended to protect the bicycle’s finish</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3L of internal storage, measures 14″ x 6″ x 2.5″ (35.6 x 15.2 x 6.4cm) </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>My Initial Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-doesnt-get-in-the-way.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-doesnt-get-in-the-way.webp\" alt=\"New Inside Line Equipment Frame Bag doesn't get in the way\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-doesnt-get-in-the-way.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-doesnt-get-in-the-way-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-doesnt-get-in-the-way-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-doesnt-get-in-the-way-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Not too bulky</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I got the simplest, black Frame Bag from ILE.

This also includes the new limited edition Blaze/Forest Xpac.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-wallet.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-wallet.webp\" alt=\"New Inside Line Equipment Frame Bag wallet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-wallet.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-wallet-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-wallet-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-wallet-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Wallet storage…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-safe-and-sound.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-safe-and-sound.webp\" alt=\"New Inside Line Equipment Frame Bag safe and sound\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-safe-and-sound.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-safe-and-sound-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-safe-and-sound-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-safe-and-sound-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>… wallet is safe and sound and out of the way</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The extensive and creative pocket placement ensures the security of your wallet, keys, and phone.

There are multiple mesh pockets inside for great organization. For me, it seems like it might be the perfect size frame bag, not too small and not too big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plenty of room for a light jacket, camera, mini drone, or plenty of snacks, without getting too bulky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Review: Riding Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-photo-stick.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-photo-stick.webp\" alt=\"New Inside Line Equipment Frame Bag photo stick\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-photo-stick.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-photo-stick-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-photo-stick-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Inside-Line-Equipment-Frame-Bag-photo-stick-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>… your favorite photo stick</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the bag is exceeding my expectations. I haven’t done any real long mileage with it so far, so I can’t comment on its long-term durability, as of yet. But it looks to be very well made, and uses high-quality materials. I could easily see this bag lasting many, many years of heavy use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price seems on par with the quality of the bag, and the fact that it is sourced and made here in the US. Another thing, which may be small to some, but is important to me, the aesthetics are subtle and subdued, adding an elegance to the bag. I appreciate a brand that keeps branding under the radar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I believe this ILE Frame Bag to be a great value for a well-made bike bag. I would heartily recommend this bag to anyone looking for a simple, well designed, and well made Frame Bag for their everyday gear hauling needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ilequipment.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ILEequipment.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-iles-new-frame-bag-is-light-versatile-and-the-perfect-size/\">First Look: ILE’s New Frame Bag is Light, Versatile, and the Perfect Size</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"18b3ecb791c7c7a28298d61a7200006d5afd6b534f780fb9e0ff93835ca81ef0","category":"Cycling"}
