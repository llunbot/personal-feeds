They would, however, lack some of the advanced features of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ such as Active Noise Cancellation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌AirPods Pro‌ are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-2/\">also rumored to be seeing an update</a> with the removal of the stems entirely, which could result in a design similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/08/beats-studio-buds-vs-airpods-pro/\">recently launched Beats Studio Buds</a>. The second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ debut isn't rumored to be happening until the first half of 2022, however.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/\">nikkei.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/airpods-3-mass-production-august/\">AirPods 3 Mass Production Said to Kick Off in August</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-3-mass-production-said-to-kick-off-in-august.2304945/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qh_AERAsS1w:UA3IlEM2t_g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qh_AERAsS1w:UA3IlEM2t_g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Qh_AERAsS1w\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae3ad96ba2ece56edbbeb1521743ddecba9fc0ca1d653e41132b79447a913508","category":"Apple"}
