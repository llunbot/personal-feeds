Bundle subscribers will see a Hulu title appear alongside Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic tiles in the Disney+ interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nClicking on the Hulu tile brings Bundle subscribers to the new Hulu Hub that has all of the Hulu content without the need to switch over to the Hulu app. The two-step launch process is meant to keep Hulu content separate from Disney+ content for parents who do not want the more adult content from Hulu accessible to children.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney said that it wants to better understand consumer needs and wants for Hulu on Disney+ before it launches in March 2024. Disney does not plan to replace either the standalone Hulu or Disney+ subscriptions, both will continue be available.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/\">Hulu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/hulu-disney-plus-merged-beta/\">Hulu on Disney+ Beta Launches for Bundle Subscribers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hulu-on-disney-beta-launches-for-bundle-subscribers.2413014/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"624faf8e9a4782317297bc659271af88f4350651c872b5a135c403273af0f5c1","category":"Apple"}
