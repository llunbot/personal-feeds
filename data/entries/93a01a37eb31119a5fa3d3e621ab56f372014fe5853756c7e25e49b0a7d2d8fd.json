Headlined by elite racers Charlie Aldridge and former gold medalist and world champion Jolanda Neff, the CFR team looks to take on the world aboard their Lefty-equipped Scalpel LAB71 race bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of today, consumers can purchase their own 2025 LAB71 CFR Team Edition Scalpel. Complete with a team paint job and CFR sponsor components, this replica bike is as close as you’ll get to the one raced by the team on the World Cup circuit. It also happens to come equipped with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?p=385658\" target=\"_blank\">brand-new XTR M9200 Di2 drivetrain and brakes that just launched today</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"The one-piece cockpit and lefty fork on the Scalpel LAB71 CFR Team Edition\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1386.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"The distinctive flex stays on the CFR Team Edition of the Scalpel LAB71 bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1259.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The Lefty OCHO fork, one-piece bar/stem, and FexPivot chainstays give the Scalpel LAB71 distinctive looks. (all photos/Cannondale)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The LAB71 Scalpel is Cannondale’s latest take on the modern full-suspension cross-country race bike. As such, it has 120 mm of travel front and rear to take on the challenges of today’s cross-country race courses. The rear end employs Cannondale’s four-bar Propotional Response Suspension design with FlexPivot chainstays. In typical Cannondale fashion, the front end features the always polarizing single-legged Lefty Ocho 120 Carbon fork. You can learn more about the geometry and features of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cannondale-scalpel-120-travel-front-and-rear/\">LAB71 Scalpel in our launch coverage</a> from last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing that sets the CFR Team edition apart from the regular LAB71 Scalpel is its CFR paint job and build kit. With a matching paint to the CFR team bike on the frame and Lefty fork, along with top-tier components from the team’s list of sponsors, the CFR Team Edition is as tricked out as they come. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277.webp\" alt=\"The full XTR drivetrain on the Scalpel LAB71 CFR Team build.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/C25_LAB71_Scalpel_CFR_Carousel_1277-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The CFR Team Edition build features the brand-new XTR M9200 Di2 wireless drivetrain. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scalpel LAB71 CFR Team Edition Build</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the eye-catching paint job, Shimano’s brand-new XTR M9200 Di2 drivetrain adds the latest wireless shifting technology.
