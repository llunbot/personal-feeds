Set to be announced on May 7, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a> models will feature LTPO (a more power efficient form of OLED), a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate, and a tandem stack and glass thinning that will bring \"ultra-thin and light displays\" that support high brightness, extended battery life, and a long lifetime.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAs has been previously rumored, today's report suggests that the ‌iPad Pro‌ models will be available in 12.9-inch and 11.1-inch sizes, with both options to feature slimmed down bezels and a much thinner design. The 12.9-inch version, for example, will be over 1mm thinner than the current model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a possibility that the 11.1-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ will be in short supply at launch because Apple has been dealing with light leakage issues that are not impacting the 12.9-inch model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with the best OLED display on the market, the ‌iPad Pro‌ models could get Apple's next-generation AI-optimized M4 chip, and they are expected to ship alongside a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> and an updated version of the Magic Keyboard. Apple will also introduce new 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch LCD <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to unveil the updated iPads on Tuesday, May 7 at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/ipad-pro-best-oled-panels/\">Apple to Use 'Best OLED Panels on the Market' for Upcoming iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-use-best-oled-panels-on-the-market-for-upcoming-ipad-pro.2425145/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee2c2eeb574cc5d38d1b8cb61325f4e8cdf3635ee454c0a4100c969a5501d5d8","category":"Apple"}
