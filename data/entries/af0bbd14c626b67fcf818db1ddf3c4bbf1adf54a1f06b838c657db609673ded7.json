Still, we don’t expect this month to be entirely empty. We’ll likely get an update to the MacBook Air that upgrades it to the M4 processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the software side, we have the iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4 betas, which add significant new capabilities and expand Apple Intelligence to new markets and languages. That beta will run all month before an April release. There are big new Siri capabilities on the way, but they haven’t been seen in these betas and might be delayed to an iOS 18.5 release that will land in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s everything we expect Apple to release this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, March 3, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2625363/tim-cook-teases-another-surprise-apple-release-this-week.html\">Tim Cook teased</a> the launch of at least one new Apple product this week, with a short video containing the tagline, “There’s Something in the Air.” Here’s what it could mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M4 MacBook Air:</strong> Of note, Cook’s “Air” tease is the same tagline used when Steve Jobs unveiled the original MacBook Air in 2008. Last year, Apple introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">MacBook Air with an M3 processor</a> on March 4. We had expected Apple to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2617684/the-m4-macbook-air-is-likely-to-arrive-in-mid-march.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a> this month, so the timing is right. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2619109/the-m4-macbook-air-looks-a-lot-like-the-m4-ipad-pro-in-early-tests.html\">Early leaked benchmarks</a> show the MacBook Air performing on par with the M4 iPad Pro, which is about what we expect. We don’t expect many other changes other than a possible upgraded FaceTime camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad Air: </strong>Apple launched the M2 iPad Air last May with an older M2 processor, so an update to the M4 makes sense. Little else is expected to change with the mid-range tablet, which got a new 13-inch model last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11th-gen iPad:</strong> Another product that could be coming is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a>. Apple released the redesigned 10th-gen model in October 2022 and rumors say a new model with Apple Intelligence support could arrive as early in March. Like the MacBook Air, this will probably be a minor refresh with mostly internal upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We got a surprise <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2598036/apple-launches-brand-new-invites-app-infused-with-ai.html\">Invites app</a> in February, along with the start of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2605277/ios-18-4-beta-begins-with-huge-apple-intelligence-expansion-but-no-new-siri.html\">iOS/iPadOS 18.4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15.4</a> betas. We don’t expect any major app arrivals in March, and those iOS and macOS updates aren’t expected to go into wide release until April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So March should be a month of continuing beta releases and maybe a minor bugs-and-security point-one update. When the iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4 updates drop in April, they will make Apple Intelligence available in more regions and languages as well as adding a few other features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We initially expected a big Siri update with the x.4 releases, but that has been absent from the first betas and has been rumored to be delayed until the 18.5/15.5 updates, which will come a month or so later. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
