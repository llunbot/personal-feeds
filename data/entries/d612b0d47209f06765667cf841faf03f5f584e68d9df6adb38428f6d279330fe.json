There is, technically, very little you cannot get running on it, given enough knowledge, time, and patience. That said, it's never a bad thing when someone has done all the work for you, leaving you to focus on what matters: sneaking game time on the couch.</p>\n<p>GeForce Now, Nvidia's game-streaming service that uses your own PC gaming libraries, has made it easier for Steam Deck owners to get its service <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/\">set up on their Deck</a>. On <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/#steam-deck-modal\">the service's Download page</a>, there is now a section for Gaming Handheld Devices. Most of the device links provide the service's Windows installer, since devices like the ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go run Windows. Some note that GeForce Now is already installed on devices like the Razer Edge and Logitech G Cloud.</p>\n<p>But Steam Deck types are special. We get a Unix-style executable script, a folder with all the necessary Steam icon image assets, and a README.md file.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021392#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d612b0d47209f06765667cf841faf03f5f584e68d9df6adb38428f6d279330fe","category":"Tech"}
