Germany’s only WorldTour race of the 2021 season headed west and over eight ‘bergs’ before turning back towards Frankfurt and the flat 30 km run-in.</p><p>With the early breakaway swept up, Team BikeExchange went on the attack a long way out in an effort to prevent the traditional sprint finish. A 15-strong breakaway escaped, but with the bulk of the climbing already dealt with, they had their work cut out. Though some pre-race favourites had been dropped – namely Dylan Groenewegen (Jumbo-Visma) – the peloton was large and motivated enough to close it down with around 25 km to go.</p><p>As they readied themselves for the inevitable bunch gallop, the sprint teams were content to let attackers Georg Zimmermann (Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux) and Cristian Scaroni (Gazprom-RusVelo) dangle out front on the flat finishing circuit, finally catching them just inside 10 km to go. </p><p>The hotly contested bunch sprint was won convincingly by the on-form Philipsen, while John Degenkolb (Lotto Soudal) took an emotional second place and four-time winner Alexander Kristoff (UAE Team Emirates) finished third.</p><div><div><p>Eschborn-Frankfurt (1.UWT) <span>Eschborn → Frankfurt-am-Main</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/cb/jasper-philipsen-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"41e65987b226fedaaeeecfd637e5b44eec2f8fab8ea7211a8ec513e52c27918e","category":"Cycling"}
