But Google is entering the foldable world with a vision of its own, and it's one I really like. This is the foldable I have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-the-future-is-an-ugly-disappointment\">long wished</a> for: a device that's a phone when folded up and a tablet when unfolded.</p>\n<p>The usual Android tablet app selection problems—which are getting better—are still present when in tablet mode. When you do find a tablet app, though, this feels like the first foldable that delivers on the promise of letting you do more on the big screen.</p>\n<p>The Pixel Fold hardware also feels shockingly advanced. Google has turned in both the thinnest foldable on the US market <em>and</em> the one with the biggest battery, which is not what you would normally expect from the software company.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949235#p3\">Read 92 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949235&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7bfb0d03727ab82dedd7bba3113f30682a9fecfcdd39bdf4771c02d759cb5f1","category":"Tech"}
