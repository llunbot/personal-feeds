The ProArt Display 5K features a 27-inch 5K screen with 218 pixels per inch, aka retina quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nASUS sells the ProArt Display 5K for $799, so it's actually half the price of the Studio Display, and much, much cheaper than the Pro Display XDR. The ProArt Display is more generic looking than Apple's monitors, so you're not getting Apple style, but if you're used to looking at a 5K Retina display and you need a second monitor, you can get that same general screen quality at a cheaper price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn our testing, the ProArt Display 5K was color accurate, sharp, and very similar to the Studio Display. Make sure to watch our video for our full hands-on review that goes into more detail on why you might want to opt for the ProArt over Apple's options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're interested in the ProArt Display, you can get it <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/us/displays-desktops/monitors/proart/proart-display-5k-pa27jcv/\">from the ASUS website</a> or <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FASUS-Display-Professional-Monitor-PA27JCV%2Fdp%2FB0D6C6F2L8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1\">from Amazon.com</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/asus-proart-5k-display/\">Testing the New ASUS ProArt 5K Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-the-new-asus-proart-5k-display.2449273/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"56db6374eafef82d91cfe6811a1b9d47a2b4a59676da81dc28eb1dcbb0f61ece","category":"Apple"}
