Case in point: a <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.248201\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Letters examining the complex mechanics behind the many resting shapes a good Jersey knit can form while at rest.</p>\n<p>Knitted fabrics are part of a class of intertwined materials—which also includes birds' nests, surgical knots, knotted shoelaces, and even the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10570-023-05683-x\">degradation of paper fibers</a> in ancient manuscripts. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/physicists-are-decoding-math-y-secrets-of-knitting-to-make-bespoke-materials/\">Knitted fabrics are technically a type</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial\">metamaterial</a>: an engineered material that gets its properties not from the base materials but from their designed structures. The elasticity (aka, stretchiness) of knitted fabrics is an <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3410/03-ask.html\">emergent property</a>: the whole is more than the sum of its parts. How those components (strands of yarn) are arranged at an intermediate scale (the structure) determines the macro scale properties of the resulting fabric.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/the-physics-of-ugly-christmas-sweaters/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/the-physics-of-ugly-christmas-sweaters/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9382167e4d12f0011f17d9705b75fe55e23ba80fb2488085c1a9142a1d5210ce","category":"Tech"}
