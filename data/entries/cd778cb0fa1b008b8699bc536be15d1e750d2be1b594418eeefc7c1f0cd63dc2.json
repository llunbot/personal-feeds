They’re made for all the spinny things on the bike, too, even those with standard metal bearings. And, they’re all reasonably priced, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cleaner ($9.90) is a bearing degreaser designed to thoroughly clean bearings, prepping them for fresh lube or grease. Just remove the seal from your bearing, squirt it in, let it sit for a bit, then rinse it out with water. It adds a bit of corrosion protection, is eco-friendly, and the package is made of recycled plastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Assembly Grease ($10.90) is for BBs. Just coat the threads or press-fit- sleeve with a light film when you install. Then, it’ll help keep things from getting stuck when it’s time to remove them for service.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1449\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1-297x239.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1-800x644.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1-120x97.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1-768x618.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyclingceramic-bearing-degreaser-1-1536x1236.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Three different bearing Grease ($7.20 to $10.80) formulations let you repack your bearings for everyday use, long duration, or <br />“time trial”. The latter is basically a race-day option and they recommend degreasing and reapplying after your event. There’s also a Pulley Wheel Oil ($10.80) that offers a lighter viscosity option for those tiny bearings inside your derailleur pulleys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://cyclingceramic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CyclingCeramic.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cyclingceramic-spins-out-new-cera-bearing-lube-grease/\">CyclingCeramic Spins Out New Cera Bearing Lube &amp; Grease</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cd778cb0fa1b008b8699bc536be15d1e750d2be1b594418eeefc7c1f0cd63dc2","category":"Cycling"}
