In 2022, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/video-games-in-2022-massive-mergers-and-peculiar-portables/\">it seemed like every other game maker</a> was flirting with \"NFT integration\" or \"blockchain support\" or some other crypto-adjacent buzzword in one form or another. Then, throughout 2023, the whole idea <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/gamestop-citing-regulatory-uncertainty-winds-down-its-crypto-and-nft-wallet/\">quickly faded away</a> as generative AI became <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/game-developer-survey-50-work-at-a-studio-already-using-generative-ai-tools/\">the latest Silicon Valley obsession</a>.</p>\n<p>But some are apparently not willing to give up on the crypto gaming dream. Playtron and Mysten Labs have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1777990298385219986\">announced</a> the <a href=\"https://sui.io/suiplay0x1\">SuiPlay0X1</a>, a new Steam Deck-alike that is being billed as \"the world's first blockchain native handheld games console.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BREAKING: announcement from onstage at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuiBasecamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SuiBasecamp</a>: we’re excited to share the first handheld gaming device with native Web3 capabilities – the SuiPlay0X1, powered by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PLAYTR0N?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PLAYTR0N</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/Zubhx6gyXG\">pic.twitter.com/Zubhx6gyXG</a></p>\n<p>— Sui (@SuiNetwork) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1777990298385219986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Currently, the device seems to exist only as a few concept renders and vague promises about finally making \"web3 gaming\" accessible to the ignorant masses who don't even know how much they need crypto features integrated into their gaming portable. But even if those promises all pan out (a very big if), it's hard to see any real value that the 0X1 would provide over the current slate of gaming handhelds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016612#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016612&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df9b1e916ee42002f6a2b0b3c11fbf71c099e3a0fa36dadc191d3b932f3e87cc","category":"Tech"}
