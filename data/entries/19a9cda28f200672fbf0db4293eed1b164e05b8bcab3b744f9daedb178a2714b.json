I was inspired to see over 100 women in tech from different industries come together to discuss AI ethics from a female perspective. Together, we explored strategies such as reducing gender bias in AI systems and promoting diverse representation in model training data. In the <a href=\"https://dev.amazoncloud.cn/\">AWS Cloud Lab</a>, participants used <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/?nc2=type_a&amp;trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Bedrock</a> with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/\">large language models (LLMs)</a> to generate rose bloom videos, which was the most popular part of this meetup.</p> \n<p>These gatherings are crucial to our efforts to engage more women in AI technology exploration and development, and to help make sure that the generative AI era evolves without gender bias. The collaborative spirit and technical curiosity displayed throughout the event is further proof that diverse teams truly build inclusive and effective solutions.</p> \n<p>Speaking of vibrant community engagement, I also had the honor of presenting at <a href=\"https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-beijing-presents-kcd-beijing-2025/\">Kubernetes Community Day (KCD) Beijing 2025</a> this weekend. The enthusiasm <a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/20/global-ar-report-ardm-24-omdia-universe-cloud-container-management-services-photo.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/03/20/global-ar-report-ardm-24-omdia-universe-cloud-container-management-services-photo.png\" alt=\"Omdia Universe: Cloud Container Management &amp; Services 2024-25 report\" width=\"340\" height=\"328\" /></a>for container technologies was remarkable, with nearly 300 developers gathering to share experiences and best practices.</p> \n<p>During my keynote introducing the <a href=\"https://awslabs.github.io/data-on-eks/\">DoEKS</a> project from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, I was struck by the depth of interest in managed Kubernetes services. The audience’s questions revealed how widely adopted services such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/?nc2=type_a&amp;amp&amp;trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)</a> have become among Chinese developers building mission-critical applications.</p> \n<p>This strong community interest aligns perfectly with findings from the <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/24-GLOBAL-en-US-omdia-other-ardm-omdia-universe-cloud-container-management-services-reprint.pdf\">Omdia Universe: Cloud Container Management &amp; Services 2024–25 report</a>. In this comprehensive evaluation of container management solutions hosted on public clouds, AWS was recognized as a Leader.</p> \n<p>The report specifically highlights that AWS offers “widest range of options for working with Kubernetes or its own container management service, across cloud, edge, and on-premises environments.” You can read the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/resources/analyst-reports/omdia/global-ar-report-ardm-24-omdia-universe-cloud-container-management-services/?trk=36baae34-e107-4879-ba82-68fd946648a0&amp;sc_channel=el\">full report about AWS offerings</a> to learn more about our comprehensive container portfolio and how we’re helping builders deploy scalable, reliable containerized applications.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Last Week’s launches</u></strong></p> \n<p>In addition to the inspiring community events, here are some AWS launches that caught my attention.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Q Business browser extension gets upgrades</strong> – The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/?trk=d21a4eb6-d91f-4286-843a-d35b2a06a274&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Q Business</a> browser extension now features significant enhancements designed to streamline browser-based tasks. Users gain access to their company’s indexed knowledge alongside web content, direct PDF support within the browser, image file attachment capabilities, and controls to remove irrelevant attachments from conversation context.

The Lambda asynchronous invocation path employs multiple queuing strategies, consistent hashing for intelligent partitioning, and shuffle-sharding techniques to minimize noisy neighbor effects. The system relies on key observability metrics (AsyncEventReceived, AsyncEventAge, and AsyncEventDropped) to maintain optimal performance. These architectural decisions enable Lambda to process tens of trillions of monthly invocations across 1.5 million active customers while providing reliable scalability and performance isolation.
