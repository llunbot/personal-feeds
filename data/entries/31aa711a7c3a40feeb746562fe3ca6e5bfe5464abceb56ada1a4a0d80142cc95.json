Nebo (Monument Trails) in Arkansas and Oakridge in OR. Between the two, I hit dry rocky hardpack and loamy, rooty PNW goodness, giving the bike plenty to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve always appreciated Marin’s take on the four-bar linkage, and this bike’s no different. It pedals well and descends with grace, and it’s easy to dial in with the available adjustments. Note that lower trim levels lose some of those external shock and fork adjustments, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-48.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-48.jpg\" alt=\"riding the 2024 marin rift zone EL lightweight alloy e-mountain bike around a big rock.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-48.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-48-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-48-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-48-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-48-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Handling is solid. We dove in blind on some very steep trails, where the brakes did all the could to keep speeds in check without surfing across the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kept the head angle set in the stock position and had no problem getting back far enough, but it’s nice to have the option to push it out a bit more if descending is your go-to activity. But our riding in AR was mostly flowing singletrack with chunky rock gardens, mild uphills, and those select (but very steep and technical) descents. And the Rift Zone handled it all just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-1.jpg\" alt=\"riding the 2024 marin rift zone EL lightweight alloy e-mountain bike in a forest.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-1-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once in the PNW, the climbs got longer and steeper. We had to earn the turns, and this is where the “low power” motor definitely keeps the bike feeling more like a regular mountain bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ridden a full-power (~80Nm) eMTB and rocketed up the mountain, then you’re in for a different experience. Mid-powered bikes (~50-55Nm) take more work. Yes, the Bosch motor has a boost mode that’ll make short rips more tolerable, but the smaller batteries require judicious use of it. On a 2.5 hour ride, I almost drained the entire battery spending most of my time in the middle “Trail” mode and turning assist off on the descents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anything bigger than 2.5 hours, I’d absolutely want the auxiliary battery supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-2-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"riding the 2024 marin rift zone EL lightweight alloy e-mountain bike in a forest.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-2-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One upside to the lower output is that it’s less likely to spin out on delicate maneuvers, like super steep and tight switchbacks. This is also where Marin’s geometry shines, making it easy to handle the techy uphills as well as the downhills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another upside (for the e-curious purists, anyway) is that a lower output makes you work more. I’ll be honest, there are some epic trails that I just don’t want to ride on an analog bike anymore, but I still want to put the work in to earn the descents. Modern lightweight/mid-power eMTBs are just the ticket for that, and this Marin is a solid option thanks to its durable alloy frame and smart component selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-7-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-7-jpg.webp\" alt=\"riding the 2024 marin rift zone EL lightweight alloy e-mountain bike in a forest.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-7-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-7-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-7-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-7-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-riding-7-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When it’s time to get rowdy, the motor doesn’t matter. I’d argue that the extra weight helps keep an eMTB planted, but my riding partner was on a full-size, full-power bike that weighed 15lbs more and would argue that it’s a bit much. That other bike wore him out to the point where he was making mistakes toward the end that cost him his phone (it smashed between his hip and a rock).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re the type of rider that prefers something more nimble but still wants the assist, I’d argue that the Rift Zone EL is a good middle ground. We ripped down 30+ minutes of epic forest singletrack, some steep, some techy, and some wide open and full gas, and I never felt out of control. That’s more impressive considering I’d never ridden any of these trails before, so I was trusting the bike as much as I was my skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-review-details-2-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-review-details-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"actual weight of XL 2024 marin rift zone EL lightweight alloy e-mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-review-details-2-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-review-details-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-review-details-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-review-details-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marin-rift-zone-EL-eMTB-review-details-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the top model in size XL.

There are some easy ways to cut weight on this (carbon bar and wheels, then carbon cranks), but it’s a good starting point that doesn’t need any immediate upgrades to enjoy</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a fan of alloy and want a solid, upgrade-worthy platform for long-term use, the new Marin Rift Zone EL is worth a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Models &amp; Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 marin rift zone EL XR.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-1536x863.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-marin-Rift-Zone-EL-XR-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rift Zone EL XR</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>• Fox 36 Performance Elite 150mm fork, Float X Performance Elite shock w/ custom tune<br />• SRAM GX Eagle AXS T-Type 12-speed drivetrain<br />• Magura MT-7 4-piston brakes w/ 203mm rotors<br />• MSRP $6999 (US), 7699€ (EU), £6699(UK), $9399(CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-2-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1106\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 marin rift zone EL 2.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-2-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-2-297x164.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-2-1536x849.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-2-120x66.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-2-768x425.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Rift Zone EL 2</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>• Fox 36 Performance 150mm fork, Float X Performance Elite shock w/ custom tune<br />• SRAM GX Eagle Lunar 12-speed drivetrain<br />• SRAM Code Bronze 4-piston brakes w/ 200mm HS2 rotors<br />• MSRP $5999 (US), 6499€ (EU), £5699 (UK), $7999 (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Rift Zone EL 1</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-1-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1141\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-1-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 marin rift zone EL 1.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-1-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-1-297x169.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-1-1536x876.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-1-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Marin-Rift-Zone-EL-1-768x438.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>• Marzocchi Bomber Z1 150mm fork/Bomber Air Inline shock w/ custom tune<br />• Shimano CUES 10-speed drivetrain<br />• TRP Slate EVO hydraulic disc brakes w/ 203mm rotors<br />• MSRP $4799 (US), 5399€ (EU), £4699 (UK), $6499 (CAN)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com\" target=\"_blank\">MarinBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-marin-rift-zone-el-e-mountain-bike/\">Marin Rift Zone EL lightens up eMTB – First Rides!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"31aa711a7c3a40feeb746562fe3ca6e5bfe5464abceb56ada1a4a0d80142cc95","category":"Cycling"}
