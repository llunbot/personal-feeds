{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup — AWS Control Tower new API, TLS 1.3 with API Gateway, Private Marketplace Catalogs, and more — February 19, 2024","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-aws-control-tower-new-api-tls-1-3-with-api-gateway-private-marketplace-catalogs-and-more-february-19-2024/","date":1708368825000,"content":"<p>Over the past week, our service teams have continued to innovate on your behalf, and a lot has happened in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> universe that I want to tell you about. I’ll also share about all the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community\">AWS Community</a> events and initiatives that are happening around the world.</p> \n<p>Let’s dive in!</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/aws-control-tower-apis-register-organizational-units/\">AWS Control Tower introduces APIs to register organizational units</a> – With these new APIs, you can extend governance to organizational units (OUs) using APIs and automate your OU provisioning workflow. The APIs can also be used for OUs that are already under AWS Control Tower governance to re-register OUs after landing zone updates. These APIs include AWS CloudFormation support, allowing customers to manage their OUs with infrastructure as code (IaC).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/api-gateway-tls-1-3/\">API Gateway now supports TLS 1.3</a> – By using TLS 1.3 with API Gateway as the centralized point of control, developers can secure communication between the client and the gateway; uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of their API traffic; and benefit from API Gateway’s integration with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for centralized deployment of SSL certificates using TLS.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/amazon-opensearch-service-update-cluster-volume-without-blue-green/\">Amazon OpenSearch Service now lets you update cluster volume without blue/green</a> – While blue/green deployments are meant to avoid any disruption to your clusters because the deployment uses additional resources on the domain, it is recommended that you perform them during low traffic periods. Now, you can update volume-related cluster configuration without requiring a blue/green deployment, ensuring minimal performance impact on your online traffic and avoiding any potential disruption to your cluster operations.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/amazon-guardduty-runtime-monitoring-protects-clusters-shared-vpc/\">Amazon GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring protects clusters running in shared VPC</a> – With this launch, customers who are already opted into automated agent management in GuardDuty will benefit from a renewed 30-day trial of GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring, where we will automatically start monitoring the resources (clusters) deployed in a shared VPC setup. Customers also have the option to manually manage the agent and provision the virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint in their shared VPC environment.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/aws-marketplace-private-marketplace-catalogs-organizational-units/\">AWS Marketplace now supports managing Private Marketplace catalogs for OUs</a> – This capability supports distinct product catalogs per business unit or development environment, empowering organizations to align software procurement with specific needs. Additionally, customers can designate a trusted member account as a delegated administrator for Private Marketplace administration, reducing the operational burden on management account administrators. With this launch, organizations can procure more quickly by providing administrators with the agile controls they need to scale their procurement governance across distinct business and user needs.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What’s New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://community.aws/students\">Join AWS Cloud Clubs Captains</a> – The C3 cohort of AWS Cloud Club Captains is open for applications from February 5–23, 2024, at 5:00 PM EST.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS open source news and updates</strong> – Our colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/094459\">Ricardo</a> writes this <a href=\"https://community.aws/content/2cXuki31b6cvPtkoOMdNNxfLKfr/aws-open-source-newsletter-189\">weekly open source newsletter</a> highlighting new open source projects, tools, and demos from the AWS Community.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Upcoming AWS events</span></strong></p> \n<p>Check your calendars and sign up for upcoming AWS events:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws-experience.com/amer/smb/xe/825e6/building-with-generative-ai-on-aws-using-partyrock-amazon-bedrock-and-amazon-q\">Building with Generative AI on AWS using PartyRock, Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q</a> – You will gain skills in prompt engineering and using the Amazon Bedrock API.

They don’t necessarily understand how they can ensure that what they build will be secure. This webinar explains how they can do that.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws-experience.com/amer/smb/e/661a1/aws-jam-session---smb-canada\">AWS Jam Session – Canada Edition</a> – AWS JAM is a gamified learning platform where you come to play, learn, and validate your AWS skills.
