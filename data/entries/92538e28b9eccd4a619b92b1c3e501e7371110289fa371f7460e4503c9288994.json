The device will instead feature the same LCD technology used in the current, 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌. The information was shared in <em>‌DigiTimes‌</em>' \"Before Going to Press\" section, so while information about the new device is currently limited, more will follow tomorrow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPad Air‌ has only ever been available in a single size, so presumably a 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ would be offered in addition to a separate model with a smaller screen, just like how the ‌iPad Pro‌ is offered in both 11- and 12.9-inch variants. A recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/\">rumor from <em>9to5Mac</em></a> claimed that Apple was working on two sixth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ models. While the piece speculated that Apple could release a larger version of the ‌‌iPad Air‌‌ to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, <em>‌DigiTimes‌</em>' report is the first specific mention of a larger ‌iPad Air‌ variant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTogether, the rumors suggest that the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ could arrive sooner rather than later in the sixth incarnation of the device. The current ‌iPad Air‌ featuring the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip launched over a year and a half ago, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/ipad-air-6-new-features-and-launch-timing/\">new model with the M2 chip</a> is widely expected to launch in the coming months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current, 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ is priced starting at $599, while the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ starts at $799. A 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ model would presumably be priced between these two products, but it is worth bearing in mind that Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/\">next-generation iPad Pro models</a> are rumored to see <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/\">price hikes</a> owing to their costly OLED display technology.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/\">Apple Working on Larger iPad Air With 12.9-Inch Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display.2408089/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"92538e28b9eccd4a619b92b1c3e501e7371110289fa371f7460e4503c9288994","category":"Apple"}
