With <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a> coming up, iMazing is testing iMazing 3, a revamped version of the software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/imazing-1.png\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nA <a href=\"https://imazing.com//blog/imazing-3-mac-beta?utm_source=macrumors&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=imazing3beta\">beta version of iMazing 3 is available</a> for testing right now, and the updated app has been rebuilt with a more intuitive and responsive interface that makes it easier for users to get to what they need on a connected ‌iPhone‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/imazing-2.png\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWhen opening the app, users are greeted with a Discover screen that provides users with quick access to iMazing's most-used features for tasks like downloading the photos from any iOS device, accessing and exporting text messages from an ‌iPhone‌ to a computer, backing up, updating to a new device, and using the drag and drop Quick Transfer to get files from a Mac to the right app on an ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/imazing-3.png\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWhile the Discover section gets users up and running with iMazing's most useful functions right away, there's also a Home screen with an overview of what you can do, and a Tools section that offers access to the entire iMazing catalog of options for doing everything from downloading your WhatsApp messages to saving copies of apps. When you connect an ‌iPhone‌ or an ‌iPad‌ to iMazing, you can also see additional information on storage and the health of the battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/imazing-4.png\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nConvenience was the main focus of the iMazing 3 redesign, and creating and managing backups is more straightforward than before to make the app accessible to users of all skill levels. For more advanced users, iMazing 3 has a Devices screen that allows multiple connected devices to be managed at once through bulk actions, simplifying fleet management.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/imazing-6.png\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn the future, iMazing 3 is set to gain improved spyware detection, automatic photo transfers, enterprise improvements, and more. iMazing 3 is a native app on the Mac, and the iMazing team worked to ensure feature parity between Macs and PCs so the app is simple to use on all platforms. iMazing 3 is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a>, and Apple's latest iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/imazing-7.png\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\niMazing 3 is set to come out later this year, but available features can be tried in a beta capacity right now. iMazing is currently <a href=\"https://imazing.com/store?coupon=MACRUMORS-iMAZING3&amp;utm_source=macrumors&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=imazing3beta\">offering <em>MacRumors</em> readers a 30 percent discount</a> on iMazing 2 and iMazing 3 for macOS and Windows through September 30, 2023 with the promo code MACRUMORS-iMAZING3.
