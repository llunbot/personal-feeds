Google has robots summarizing search results, interacting with your apps, and analyzing the data on your phone. And sometimes, the output of generative AI systems can be surprisingly good despite lacking any real knowledge. But can they do science?</span></p>\n<p><span>Google Research is now angling to turn AI into a scientist—well, a \"co-scientist.\" The company has a new multi-agent AI system based on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/\">Gemini 2.0</a> aimed at biomedical researchers that can supposedly point the way toward new hypotheses and areas of biomedical research. However, Google's AI co-scientist boils down to a fancy chatbot. </span></p>\n<p><span>A flesh-and-blood scientist using Google's co-scientist would input their research goals, ideas, and references to past research, allowing the robot to generate possible avenues of research. The AI co-scientist contains multiple interconnected models that churn through the input data and access Internet resources to refine the output. Inside the tool, the different agents challenge each other to create a \"self-improving loop,\" which is similar to the new raft of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">reasoning AI models</a> like Gemini Flash Thinking and OpenAI o3.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/googles-new-ai-generates-hypotheses-for-researchers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/googles-new-ai-generates-hypotheses-for-researchers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"35a7d5d240f93bbe81f289daf51a824bb019a57911c8bd956bbe42c7cc822e47","category":"Tech"}
