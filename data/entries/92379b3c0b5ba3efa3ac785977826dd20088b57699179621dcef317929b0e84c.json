A world expert in the history and life of Black cycling champions, former elite racer and academic, Dr Marlon Moncrieffe, combines his own elite racing experience with that of several other contributors. The first book of its kind, this collection of stories, personal reflections and interviews with historical icons of sport and current agents of change, addresses the essential questions of access, diversity, inclusion and of representation. Exploring how figures such as Major Taylor and Maurice Burton discovered cycling, the book sheds light on the mentors who encouraged them to pursue their ambitions as well as the explicit and implicit forms of discrimination they faced. From the first non-white rider to compete in the Tour de France in 1914 to the Black cyclists who push the boundaries today, discover how the determination to succeed despite discrimination defined the careers of these great athletes.</p>\n<p>Includes interviews with:</p>\n<p>Major Taylor, Kittie Knox, David Weller, Maurice Burton, Russell Williams, Nelson Vails, Justin and Cory Williams, Gregory Bauge, Rashaan Bahati, Kevin Reza, Tre Whyte, Shanaze Reade, David Clarke, Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado, Nicholas Dlamini, between others.</p>\n<p>In stock now at <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/ch/fr/shop/desire%2C-discrimination%2C-determination-black-champions-in-cycling/product/ALI01XX\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"92379b3c0b5ba3efa3ac785977826dd20088b57699179621dcef317929b0e84c","category":"Cycling"}
