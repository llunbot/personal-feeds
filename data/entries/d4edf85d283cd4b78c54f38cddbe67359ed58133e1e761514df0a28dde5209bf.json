The price has increased from the Propero 3 it replaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the brand has updated the Torch 3.0 and 2.0 shoes. Both use Boa Li2 dial closures and incorporate a carbon sole with three-bolt drilling and large rubber anti-slip pads. There are small price decreases from the previous models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Propero 4 helmet is priced at £165; the Torch 2.0 shoes are £165 and it’s £210 for the Torch 3.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy yours now at <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fgb%2Fen\"

aerodynamics as well as ventilation from the latest Propero 4 helmet, while keeping to a claimed weight of 290g for a size medium helmet. It says that the design melds the ventilation of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-launches-s-works-prevail-ii-vent-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Prevail</a> 3 lightweight vented helmet with the aerodynamics of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-evade-3-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Evade</a> 3 for a fast, lightweight helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It says it’s achieved this by adopting a similar frontal design to the Evade, while adding extra rear venting adapted from the Prevail 3. It used CFD modelling and wind tunnel testing to develop a vent pattern that it says increases airflow and hence cooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over a range of wind <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-science-yaw-angles-explained\" target=\"_blank\">yaw angles</a>, Specialized says that the new Propero 4 helmet is 4 watts more efficient than the Prevail 3 vented helmet at 45kph. It hasn’t released any comparisons to the Evade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the brand says that it has tweaked the Prevail 3’s vent design for the new Propero 4 by adding 2mm ‘micro-channels’ to increase cooling. It reckons these work like a tumble dryer, increasing turbulence in the air flowing through the helmet to augment the cooling effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with almost all new helmets, Specialized has had the new Propero 4 crash tested by the independent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Tech helmet lab</a>, where it has earned a 5-star rating. The helmet design includes Mips Evolve, while the adjustment system is derived from that of the S-Works helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Torch 2.0 and 3.0 shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1-970x651.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1-970x651.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1-750x503.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1-1140x765.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-3.0-Press-Photos-1.jpg 1792w\" /><figcaption>Specialized </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also launched today are updated Torch 2.0 and 3.0 shoes. As with the Propero 4 helmet, Specialized says that it has trickled down tech from its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/specialized-s-works-torch-launch\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Torch range </a>into the new shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That starts with Specialized’s long-standing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/science-works\" target=\"_blank\">Body Geometry</a> features, which it first introduced 20 years ago and which it says help prevent foot collapse, misalignment in the leg joints and hot foot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Body Geometry includes three specific design features: a 1.5mm Varus wedge, longitudinal arch support in the outsole and a metatarsal button, which splays the bones in the forefoot to help nerve and circulatory function. Custom footbeds allow you to fine-tune the fit if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opt for the Torch 3.0 shoes and you get two Li2 Boa dials with ratcheting tensioning and release as well as quick release by lifting the dial. There’s also a seam-free upper, which Specialized says mirrors that of the S-Works Torch shoes, provides a close, supportive fit and ensures foot security. The upper incorporates mesh and laser perforation for ventilation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unidirectional carbon sole unit includes rubber grips, which Specialized says will help you waddle into the coffee shop or put a foot down at a stop. Both the Torch 3.0 and Torch 2.0 are drilled for three-bolt cleats only.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-970x649.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-970x649.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-768x514.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-1536x1027.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-750x502.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Specialized-Torch-2.0-Press-Photos-1.jpg 1781w\" /><figcaption>Specialized </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning to the Torch 2.0, Specialized says that these shoes are aimed more at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/road-cycling-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">beginner cyclists</a> and indoor spin bike users. They too incorporate Specialized’s Body Geometry features for foot and leg comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closure is a single Boa Li2 dial with a stretch-free Dyneema fabric lace and woven lace guides and a velcro strap. The upper is a single piece, seamless design, again with laser perforation, although without the mesh inserts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the Torch 3.0, there’s a carbon sole unit, although in this case it’s woven rather than unidirectional. Specialized says that it saves weight relative to a nylon unit. Here too, you get rubber sole inserts to help you avoid slipping on a wet surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sizes, weights and international pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Propero 4 helmet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Propero 4 helmet is available in three sizes.
