{"title":"2025 Bentley Continental GT: Big power, big battery, big price","link":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-bentley-continental-gt-the-highs-and-lows-of-borrowed-bits/","date":1747140759000,"content":"<p>The new Bentley Continental GT was already an imposing figure before this one left the factory in Crewe clad in dark satin paint and devoid of the usual chrome. And under the bonnet—or hood, if you prefer—you'll no longer find 12 cylinders. Instead, there's now an all-new twin-turbo V8 plug-in hybrid powertrain that offers both continent-crushing amounts of power and torque, but also a big enough battery for a day's driving around town.</p>\n<p>We covered the details of the new hybrid a bit after our brief drive in the prototype <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/heres-what-we-learned-driving-a-prototype-of-bentleys-new-hybrid-gt/\">this time last year</a>. At the time, we also shared that the new PHEV bits have been brought over from Porsche. There's quite a lot of Panamera DNA in the new Continental GT, as well as some recent Audi ancestry. Bentley is quite good at the engineering remix, though: Little more than a decade <a href=\"https://rmsothebys.com/all-stories-videos/hope-and-glory-the-wo-bentley-story/\">after it was founded by W.O.</a>, the brand belonged to Rolls-Royce, and so started a long history of parts-sharing.</p>\n<h2>Mind if I use that?</h2>\n<p>Rolls-Royce and Bentley went their separate ways in 2003. The unraveling started a few years earlier when the aerospace company that owned them decided to rationalize and get itself out of the car business. In 1997 it sold the rights to Rolls-Royce to BMW, or at least the rights to the name and logos. Volkswagen Group got the rest, including the factory in Crewe, and got to work on a new generation of Bentleys for a new century.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-bentley-continental-gt-the-highs-and-lows-of-borrowed-bits/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-bentley-continental-gt-the-highs-and-lows-of-borrowed-bits/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
