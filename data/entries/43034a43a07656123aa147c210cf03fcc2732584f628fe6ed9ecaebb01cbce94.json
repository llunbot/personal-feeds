All X users are opted in by default, with X failing to notify customers about the change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe hidden setting gives X permission to use all posts, interactions, inputs, and results for \"training and fine-turning\" Elon Musk's Grok AI model.\r<br />\n<blockquote>To continuously improve your experience, we may utilize your X posts as well as your user interactions, inputs and results with Grok for training and fine-tuning purposes.

It previously said that \"user interactions, inputs, and results\" would be used for Grok training, but now the wording also includes X posts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240627145617/https://help.x.com/en/using-x/about-grok\">June 27 wording</a>:</strong>\r<br />\n<blockquote>To continually improve the AI system and provide a better user experience, we may utilize user interactions, inputs and results for training and fine-tuning purposes. This means that when you interact with Grok, your interactions, inputs and results may be used to train and enhance the system's performance.</blockquote><strong>Today's wording:</strong><blockquote>To continuously improve your experience, we may utilize your X posts as well as your user interactions, inputs and results with Grok for training and fine-tuning purposes. This also means that when you interact with Grok, your interactions, inputs and results may be used to train and enhance the system's performance.</blockquote>Grok has previously been able to access \"real-time public X posts\" to respond to user queries, but it is not clear if X posts were being used for training. The opt-out toggle seems to have been enabled around May, so it's possible that's when user posts were first used for improving the chatbot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nX says that user interactions with the chatbot and X posts are used for the following:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Enhance Grok's understanding of human language and communication.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Improve Grok's ability to provide accurate, relevant, and engaging responses.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Develop Grok's sense of humor and wit to make interactions more enjoyable.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Ensure Grok remains politically unbiased and provides balanced answers.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nElon Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815325410667749760\">claimed earlier this week</a> that Grok was being trained on \"the most powerful AI training cluster in the world.\" Grok is currently available to X premium subscribers.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/x-grok-ai-tweets-auto-opt-in/\">X Training Grok AI On Tweets Without Notifying Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/x-training-grok-ai-on-tweets-without-notifying-users.2432302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43034a43a07656123aa147c210cf03fcc2732584f628fe6ed9ecaebb01cbce94","category":"Apple"}
