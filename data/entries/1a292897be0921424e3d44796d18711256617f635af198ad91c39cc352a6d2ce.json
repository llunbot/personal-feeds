The memo, written to employees at WordPress.com parent company Automattic, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/verizon-selling-tumblr-to-automattic-the-owner-of-wordpress-com/\">bought Tumblr from Verizon's media arm in 2019</a>, is titled or subtitled \"You win or you learn.\" The posted memo states that a majority of the 139 employees working on product and marketing at Tumblr (in a team <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@waxpancake/post/CzbZEwxrDyq\">apparently named \"Bumblr\"</a>) will \"switch to other divisions.\" Those working in \"Happiness\" (Automattic's customer support and service division) and \"T&amp;S\" (trust and safety) would remain.</p>\n<p>\"We are at the point where after 600+ person-years of effort put into Tumblr since the acquisition in 2019, we have not gotten the expected results from our effort, which was to have revenue and usage above its previous peaks,\" the posted memo reads. After quotes and anecdotes about love, loss, mountain climbing, and learning on the journey, the memo notes that nobody will be let go and that team members can make a ranked list of their top three preferred assignments elsewhere <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">inside Automattic</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982553#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982553&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a292897be0921424e3d44796d18711256617f635af198ad91c39cc352a6d2ce","category":"Tech"}
