You’ve built your infrastructure, your Terraform code is looking clean — and then… “Something” happens and now it’s a race against time (and your own sanity) to fix it before the leaderboard locks.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to AWS GameDay: the hands-on, team-based challenge where technical professionals sharpen their real-world AWS and Terraform skills in a dynamic, gamified environment. No step-by-step instructions. No hand-holding. Just you, your team, and a fast-moving cloud infrastructure scenario where every decision counts.</p>\n\n<p>In this blog I’ll share some reasons why you’d want to participate in a GameDay, what an AWS GameDay with Terraform looks like, and how you can run your own AWS and Terraform GameDay event.</p>\n\n<h2>Why participate in AWS GameDay?</h2>\n\n<p>AWS GameDay is a hands-on, team-based exercise designed for technical professionals to sharpen their skills by solving real-world cloud challenges. Unlike traditional training, a GameDay is open-ended and non-prescriptive, allowing participants to experiment, explore, and innovate in a dynamic environment.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what you get out of it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-world cloud skills</strong>: Launch and repair AWS infrastructure using <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands\">Terraform CLI</a> like a pro.</li>\n<li><strong>Boost collaboration</strong>: Work as a team to brainstorm solutions and divide tasks under pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Safe-to-fail environment</strong>: Go wild. Experiment. No production outages to worry about.</li>\n<li><strong>Battle-hardened troubleshooting skills</strong>: Break it, fix it, break it again — this is where real problem-solvers are made.</li>\n<li><strong>Boost your Terraform + AWS cred</strong>: Walk away sharper, faster, and maybe even brag a little.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1746468531-gamedayvid.gif\" alt=\"AWS\" /><h2>AWS GameDay with Terraform</h2>\n\n<p>The AWS + HashiCorp GameDay is a new collaboration where teams take on the role of cloud engineers for a fictional startup. Equipped with an initial Terraform codebase, your team will race to deploy critical AWS infrastructure, adapt to business needs, and respond to unexpected challenges that unfold during the event.</p>\n\n<p>Every decision impacts your standing on the real-time leaderboard, where teamwork and creativity can set you apart.</p>\n\n<p>During the event, you’ll interact with Terraform to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy real AWS resources using infrastructure as code</li>\n<li>Troubleshoot and fix misconfigurations</li>\n<li>Implement best practices in security, scalability, and availability</li>\n<li>Recover from simulated failures</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Future AWS GameDays will expand to include additional HashiCorp tools like HCP Terraform, Vault, Nomad, and more — so this is just the beginning!</p>\n\n<h2>What does an AWS GameDay event look like?</h2>\n\n<p>AWS GameDay events can be hosted virtually, in person, or as a hybrid experience. Here’s what you can expect on game day:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Kickoff:</strong> Teams are onboarded to the GameDay platform, the challenge is introduced, and your Terraform repo is handed over. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Deployment and chaos:</strong> Quickly deploy your infrastructure — then scramble to adapt as unexpected failures test your resilience.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1746468531-gamedayhelping.jpg\" alt=\"Korea\" /><ul>\n<li><strong>Point scoring and leaderboard:</strong> Complete objectives and recover from failures to rack up points in real time.</li>\n<li><strong>Award ceremony:</strong> Top teams will be recognized and prizes awarded.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1746468531-scoreboard.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\" /><h2>Tips for success at an AWS GameDay</h2>\n\n<p>Get the most out of your GameDay experience by keeping these tips in mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prepare early:</strong> Brush up on Terraform basics and AWS core services.</li>\n<li><strong>Communicate constantly:</strong> Strong team communication is key during fast-paced troubleshooting.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay calm under pressure:</strong> Chaos is part of the game — embrace it and problem-solve methodically.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask for help:</strong> GameDay support staff are there to guide you when you get stuck.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1746468531-top5.jpg\" alt=\"The\" /><h2>How YOU can run a Terraform GameDay</h2>\n\n<p>Are you interested in bringing an AWS GameDay with Terraform to your organization or community?
