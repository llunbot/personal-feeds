Deviate has settled on 145mm of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">rear-suspension travel</a>, sitting in between the models it replaces.</p>\n<p>The Highlander II frame starts at £3,120/$3,600/€3,600 and will be available in four sizes, with a small size featuring for the first time in the Deviate range.</p>\n<p>The frame is now available to order from Deviate Cycles, with stock ready for shipping.</p>\n<h2>High-pivot progression</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Deviate Highlander II frame\" title=\"Deviate Highlander II frame\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new frame is available in Atlantic Blue or Islay Sand.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Deviate Cycles</i></span></div>\n<p>The Highlander II has a full carbon fibre frame that Deviate says is more evolution than revolution from the bikes it replaces.</p>\n<p>The bike still features Deviate’s high-pivot suspension platform, which the brand says remains largely unchanged, with only minor adjustments to the progressive leverage curve.</p>\n<p>Deviate has split the difference on the 140 and 150 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/deviate-highlander-review/\">Highlander</a> models, giving this new version 145mm of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a>.</p>\n<p>The bike is designed around a 160mm front fork, though Deviate hasn’t stated if this is the maximum travel the frame accepts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Deviate Highlander II on a mountain\" title=\"Deviate Highlander II on a mountain\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like the bike it replaces, the Highlander II is designed around a 160mm fork with a 44mm offset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Vincent </i></span></div>\n<p>Deviate says the reward axle path of the high-pivot linkage gives the bike high levels of stability on rough trails, while the 18-tooth idler pulley controls anti-squat and pedal kickback.</p>\n<p>The bike uses a 126-link chain, which means it’s compatible with standard-length chains. This removes the need to join two chains together, which is sometimes needed on high-pivot bikes due to routing the chain higher on the bike.</p>\n<h2>Flush frame protection</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Deviate Highlander II in forest\" title=\"Deviate Highlander II in forest\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The refreshed frame takes design cues from the Claymore.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Vincent </i></span></div>\n<p>The shock mount on the frame now sits flush with the down tube.
