The site found code related to “Apple Invites” back in the iOS 18.2 betas that were gone from the final release but have resurfaced in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/ios-18-3-release-date-beta-features-and-compatibility.html\">second iOS 18.3 beta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As 9to5Mac explains, the app seems fairly basic, displaying a list of the people invited to a specific event along with who has confirmed their attendance. Other similar apps such as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/evite-party-invitation-maker/id431685286\">Evite</a> or <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/invitd-text-invitation-rsvp/id886843366\">Invitd</a> also allow you to create invitations and send them to people, which Invites would presumably also be able to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From analyzing the code, 9to5Mac believes that the app will offer some additional features (and almost certainly a more fun interface) than simply inviting people to a calendar invite. It will integrate with iCloud and have a web version on iCloud.com. The app makes use of a new GroupKit framework that has been present since iOS 18.0 was released but is not used by any Apple app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code doesn’t indicate whether Invites will be a standalone app or a smaller Calendar or iMessages feature, such as <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/personal-safety/use-check-in-for-messages-ips56b5bc469/web\">Check In</a>. It’s also not clear if or when it will ever appear—it wasn’t part of any previous announcement and could simply be an experiment, or some development work happening for a feature intended to be part of iOS 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to release iOS 18.3 in late January or early Februrary, while iOS 19 will be unveiled at WWDC in June.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"19a0d447fa3d90cc4582ae32a5d718feb8ccf172be37ea178909fdae9a62d65a","category":"Apple"}
