The review interface will prompt users to add information like price ranges or whether a restaurant offers takeout or delivery.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor Android users, Google has added a new Timeline Insights tab that's designed to provide details on modes of transportation used, miles traveled, and how much time has been spent at different places like shops, airports, and restaurants.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA Trips feature, also available on Android, lets users relive past trips that they've taken by resurfacing restaurants visited, hotels stayed in, and more. There is no word on whether Timeline Insights or Trips is coming to iOS, but these features require detailed Location History.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle Maps for iOS can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free.
