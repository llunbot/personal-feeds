The payments are due after Intelsat and SES clear the lower 300 MHz of C-band spectrum, which is being transitioned from satellite services to terrestrial 5G under the supervision of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>\n<p>The FCC <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/verizon-and-att-dominate-spectrum-auction-spending-combined-69-billion/\">auctioned the C-band spectrum</a> for the rollout of 5G services in 2020.
