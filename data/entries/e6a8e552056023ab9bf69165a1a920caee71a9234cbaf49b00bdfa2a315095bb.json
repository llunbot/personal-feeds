The ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ didn't sell out and should be readily available, but there is a wait online for the nano-texture glass option on higher-capacity 1TB and 2TB ‌iPad Pro‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new iPads will kick off in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPricing on the ‌iPad Air‌ starts at $599, while pricing on the ‌iPad Pro‌ starts at $999. The Magic Keyboard is priced starting at $299, while the ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro is $129.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMake sure to stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> because we'll have a hands-on review of the new ‌iPad Pro‌ tomorrow morning.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/m4-ipad-pro-new-zealand-australia/\">M4 iPad Pro Models Start Arriving to Customers in New Zealand and Australia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-ipad-pro-models-start-arriving-to-customers-in-new-zealand-and-australia.2426342/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e6a8e552056023ab9bf69165a1a920caee71a9234cbaf49b00bdfa2a315095bb","category":"Apple"}
