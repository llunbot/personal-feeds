I am going to write more after this sentence, but that's basically the review. You're welcome to keep reading, and I would appreciate it if you would, but truly there is only one number you need to know, and it is \"$200.\"</p>\n<p>All three of these Super cards—the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-geforce-rtx-4070-super-makes-a-good-gpu-even-better-still-costs-600/\">4070 Super</a>, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/4070-ti-super-review-faster-gpu-for-the-same-799-but-not-nvidias-best-value/\">4070 Ti Super</a>, and now the 4080 Super—are mild correctives for a GPU generation that has been more expensive than its predecessors and also, in relative terms, less of a performance boost. The difference is that where the 4070 Super and 4070 Ti Super try to earn their existing price tags by boosting performance, the 4080 Super focuses on lowering its price to be more in line with where its competition is.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's marginally faster than the original 4080, but its best feature is a price drop from $1,199 to a still high, but more reasonable, $999. What it <em>doesn't</em> do is attempt to close the gap between the 4080 series and the 4090, a card that still significantly outruns any other consumer GPU that AMD or Nvidia offers. But if you have a big budget, want something that's still head-and-shoulders above the entire RTX 30-series, and don't want to deal with the 4090's currently inflated pricing, the 4080 Super is much more appealing than the regular 4080, even if it is basically the same GPU with a new name.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998883#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998883&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be6204c2f01a18f4abb525979b7a1decf861833da89e084df16c53d6cce3d879","category":"Tech"}
