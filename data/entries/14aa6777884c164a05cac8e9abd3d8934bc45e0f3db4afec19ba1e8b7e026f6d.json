We decided to test out Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to see how they measure up to the Mac versions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> video editor Dan Barbera uses Final Cut Pro to edit the videos that you see on <em>MacRumors</em>, so it's software that he's very familiar with. He doesn't use Logic Pro as often, but takes a look at the interface differences.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinal Cut Pro and Logic Pro for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> promise to deliver many of the same features that are available on the Mac, with a touch-first interface that's optimized for the ‌iPad‌. Dan will be editing a full video on the ‌iPad‌ using Final Cut Pro, so keep an eye out for that follow-up to the initial hands-on look.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinal Cut Pro requires an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip or later, so it is limited to Apple's newest iPads. Logic Pro requires an A12 Bionic chip or later. The apps are priced at $4.99 per month or $49 per year in the United States, with a one-month free trial available.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/logic-pro/\">Logic Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/\">Final Cut Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/23/hands-on-final-cut-pro-ipad/\">Hands-On With Final Cut Pro for iPad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-final-cut-pro-for-ipad.2390324/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"14aa6777884c164a05cac8e9abd3d8934bc45e0f3db4afec19ba1e8b7e026f6d","category":"Apple"}
