If Siri thinks ChatGPT can help answer your question, you'll get a pop-up permission box asking if you want to send your question to the chatbot. The response will come back in a window indicating that the information came from an outside source. This is the same way Siri treats a search engine (namely, Google), so how exactly Siri draws a line between ChatGPT and a search engine will be interesting. In Apple's lone example, there was a \"help\" intent, with the input saying to \"help me plan a five-course meal\" given certain ingredient limitations. That sort of ultra-specific input is something you can't do with a traditional search engine.</p>\n<p>Siri can also send photos to ChatGPT. In Apple's example, the user snapped a picture of a wooden deck and asked Siri about decorating options. It sounds like the standard generative AI summary features will be here, too, with Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi mentioning that \"you can also ask questions about your documents, presentations, or PDFs.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030392#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"593a67229d31a8af30dfe5d644bdd5c4d5f071648732d03195b2bb3dce9bc8a8","category":"Tech"}
