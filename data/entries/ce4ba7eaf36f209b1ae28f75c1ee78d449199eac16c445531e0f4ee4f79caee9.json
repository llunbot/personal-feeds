It features magnetic tips that connect to one another when the ChargeKey is not in use, and then when needed, the two halves fold out into a small charging cable with a durable, braided design. When folded, the ChargeKey is 7.6cm long, and when unfolded, it is 12cm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's a USB-C version of the ChargeKey with two USB-C connectors for charging an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, or future <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/\">USB-C iPhone</a> with a USB-C power adapter, and there's also a Lightning version with a Lightning connector for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and a USB-C end that connects to a computer or power adapter. It can fast charge an ‌iPhone‌ up to 20W with an appropriate power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack when Nomad launched in 2013, the ChargeKey was one of its first products. The old version was available with Lightning and microUSB, compared to the new version with USB-C connectivity. We were able to test out the ChargeKey ahead of launch, and it is an ideal portable charger for use when you need a cable on the go. It should stand up well to abuse with its braided cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nomadgoods.com/products/chargekey-lightning\">Nomad's Lightning ChargeKey</a> is priced at $35, and the <a href=\"https://nomadgoods.com/products/chargekey-usb-c\">USB-C ChargeKey</a> is priced at $25.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nomad/\">Nomad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/nomad-debuts-revamped-chargekey/\">Nomad Introduces Revamped 'ChargeKey' With Lightning and USB-C Options</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-introduces-revamped-chargekey-with-lightning-and-usb-c-options.2396435/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce4ba7eaf36f209b1ae28f75c1ee78d449199eac16c445531e0f4ee4f79caee9","category":"Apple"}
