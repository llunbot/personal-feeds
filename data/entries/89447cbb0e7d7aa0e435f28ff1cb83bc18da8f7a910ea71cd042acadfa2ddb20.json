This year it will stress improvements to video recording. One of the goals for 2025's iPhone line is to get the vlogging community and other video creators to move away from standalone cameras and use the iPhone for even more of their work. Look for Apple to more heavily than ever tout these video recording capabilities when the new iPhones debut in September.</blockquote>Video recording capabilities already added to iPhones over the years include an Action mode for stabilization, Cinematic mode for shallow depth-of-field, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMultiple sources have claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a redesigned rear camera system. An alleged render of the iPhone 17 Pro revealed that the back of the device will supposedly have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/\">large rectangular camera bar</a> with rounded corners. The device is expected to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/both-iphone-17-pro-models-three-48mp-cameras/\">three 48-megapixel rear cameras</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman's newsletter also reiterated that Apple plans to launch its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-nearing-decision-foldable-display-supplier/\">first foldable iPhone</a> in 2026.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/iphone-17-pro-video-recording-improvements/\">iPhone 17 Pro Said to Offer New Video Recording Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-said-to-offer-new-video-recording-features.2450080/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"89447cbb0e7d7aa0e435f28ff1cb83bc18da8f7a910ea71cd042acadfa2ddb20","category":"Apple"}
