It can also go up to 120 Hz, based on what you're doing. The Apple laptop's screen has a lower pixel density (254 pixels per inch) than the Asus (283 ppi) and uses Mini LED technology, which is generally a step down contrast-wise from OLEDs. On the upside, the MacBook Pro has a brighter screen (up to 1,000 nits full-screen, compared to the Studiobook's claimed 550 nits).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818259#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818259&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"42a10885f99309a0a7c2471e291317b2c6d62fa56a475cc9f916d6cf127a5c2a","category":"Tech"}
