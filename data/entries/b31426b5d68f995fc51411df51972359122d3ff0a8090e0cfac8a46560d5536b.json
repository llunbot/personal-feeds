They are able to \"think\" with images, blending visual and textual reasoning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\no3 excels at coding, math, science, and visual perception, and OpenAI says that it's ideal for complex queries where an answer is not immediately obvious, and it is adept at visual tasks like analyzing charts and graphics.\r<br />\n\r<br />\no4-mini is a smaller model that is optimized for quick and cost-efficient reasoning, and it is ideal for math, coding, and visual tasks. It supports higher usage limits than o3. Both of the new models are designed to be more natural and conversational, offering more useful and verifiable responses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\no3, o4-mini, and o4-mini-high are available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users as of today, replacing o1, o3-mini, and o3-mini-high. Free users are able to try o4-mini by using the \"Think\" option in the composer when submitting a query. Rate limits remain the same.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/openai-releases-smarter-ai-models/\">OpenAI Releases Smarter AI Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-releases-smarter-ai-models.2455454/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b31426b5d68f995fc51411df51972359122d3ff0a8090e0cfac8a46560d5536b","category":"Apple"}
