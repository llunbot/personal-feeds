His journey into film began as a snowboarder when he picked up a Sony VX1000 video camera. He soon found himself drawn into the storytelling behind the scenes, rather than capturing the snowboard tricks themselves. Chad’s ambition is to use the Rapha Film Fund as an opportunity to shed light on the experiences and perspectives within the Deaf and Queer communities and how cycling plays a transformative role in people’s lives.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rapha-film-fund/\">The Rapha Film Fund Presents: Unspoken Road</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"50643e7c49829620f2f0a47e0da6ca4df68c5301e8964248d17e9dfa1369d757","category":"Cycling"}
