But the infected person had no known contact with infected animals—unlike all of the other 13 human cases identified amid the dairy outbreak this year. Those previous cases have all occurred in dairy- or poultry-farm workers. In fact, Missouri has not reported bird flu in its dairy herds nor recent poultry outbreaks.</p>\n<p>Given the unexplained source of infection, health investigators in the state have been working to track the virus both backward in time—to try to identify the source—and forward—to identify any potential onward spread. The bird flu patient was initially hospitalized on August 22 but recovered and had been released by the time the state publicly reported the case.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053207#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053207&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"350fc5d07391e65b3cb69d5e69c41c77b617a5227cc63046ce9acdef880767bb","category":"Tech"}
