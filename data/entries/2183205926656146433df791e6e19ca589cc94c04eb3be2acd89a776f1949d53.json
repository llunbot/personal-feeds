Apple was finally approved by financial regulators <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/apple-pay-korea-launch-approved-2023/\">back in February</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNFC terminal adoption was also low in retail stores in South Korea around when ‌Apple Pay‌ first launched, which <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2023/03/126_347377.html\">continues to be an issue</a>. There are more NFC terminals than there were six years ago, but <em>The Korea Times</em> suggests ‌Apple Pay‌ will face \"significant challenges\" in Korea due to the limited number of NFC terminals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith ‌Apple Pay‌, credit and debit cards from supported banks in South Korea can be added to the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch to make purchases at stores that have contactless payment options. ‌Apple Pay‌ cards can also be used on ‌iPhone‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac to make ‌Apple Pay‌ purchases on the web.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/kr/apple-pay/\">the Apple Pay website in South Korea</a>, a number of stores are accepting ‌Apple Pay‌ including McDonald's, Shake Shack, Lotteria, Krispy Kreme, Gong Cha, Lotte, HomePlus, Hollys, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the current time, ‌Apple Pay‌ is limited to Hyundai Card users, which could see South Koreans interested in using the service picking up a Hyundai Card. No other card companies are participating in ‌Apple Pay‌ as of yet.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/south-korea/\">South Korea</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/apple-pay-south-korea/\">Apple Pay Launches in South Korea</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-launches-in-south-korea.2384239/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2183205926656146433df791e6e19ca589cc94c04eb3be2acd89a776f1949d53","category":"Apple"}
