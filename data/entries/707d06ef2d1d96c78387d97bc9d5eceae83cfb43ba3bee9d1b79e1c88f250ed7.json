It’s my birthday today, but I’m happy to give them this victory as a gift to them all as well.’</p>\n<p>The finish in Santa Cruz de Bezana saw Jakobsen initially struggle to stay in contention in a tricky final kilometre, but he took up the perfect position at just the right time to outsprint Jordi Meeus (Bora-Hansgrohe) and Matteo Trentin (UAE Team Emirates) in the final drag.</p>\n<p>The win saw the Dutch sprinter extend his lead in the green jersey competition, his total of 250 points now well clear of his nearest rival Trentin on 123 points.</p>\n<p>While there are no more sprint finishes at this year's Vuelta for Jackobsen and the <a href=\"/tags/deceuninck-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Deceuninck-QuickStep</a> leadout train to target, he will at least have a strong team to help over the mountains before the final stage individual time-trial on Sunday.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/5020/tour-de-france-2018-dan-martin-takes-victory-at-m-r-de-bretagne-as-froome-and-bardet-lose\">Tour de France 2018: Dan Martin takes victory at Mûr de Bretagne as Froome and Bardet lose time</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/5482/still-hungry-dan-martin-profile\">Still hungry: Dan Martin profile</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>    </div></div><p>\n‘I have to get over those mountains. But my teammates will stay with me, and if I stay healthy and on my bike, the green jersey is a reachable goal,’ Jakobsen added.</p>\n<p>Odd Christian Eiking still holds the red jersey for Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert by 54 seconds over Cofidis’ Guillaume Martin and 1:36sec over Jumbo-Visma’s Primož Roglič, potentially setting up an explosive fight for the general classification over the last few days in the mountains.</p>\n<p>Sounds great for those of us watching at home, probably less so for Fabio Jakobsen.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, check out photographer Chris Auld's image selection from Stage 16:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/10042/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-16-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 48</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_16_01_0.jpg?itok=wgHUgOHA\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>48</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/10042/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-16-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 16 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>1 Sep 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F10042%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2016%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F10042%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2016%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F10042%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2016%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F10042%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/10042/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-16-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 48</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_16_01_0.jpg?itok=wgHUgOHA\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"707d06ef2d1d96c78387d97bc9d5eceae83cfb43ba3bee9d1b79e1c88f250ed7","category":"Cycling"}
