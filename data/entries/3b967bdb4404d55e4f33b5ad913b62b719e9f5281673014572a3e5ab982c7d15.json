The name sums up the idea and ethos of the tire. The CADEX Aero Cotton tire is a slick, high-performance road tire aimed squarely at elite (and aspiring elite) racers, TT specialists, and anyone who likes a little classic road feel with their speed. It’s their first cotton-casing road tire, and while we haven’t had a chance to ride it yet, the specs suggest it’s chasing every aero and rolling-resistance advantage it can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"7951\" height=\"5304\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-jpg.webp\" alt=\"CADEX Aero Cotton Locked In\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-jpg.webp 7951w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Locked-In-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/ CADEX)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>CADEX Aero Cotton </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re familiar with the CADEX Race, Classics, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-ride-impressions-cadex-50-ultra-are-just-as-fast-on-the-gravel-as-on-the-road/\">Aero</a>, this tire is like a mix of all three. The aforementioned are all very fast (we’re very fond of the Classics in 32mm ourselves), but all max out at 170tpi.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CADEX Aero Cotton tires aren’t just a tweak—this one’s carved out a distinct new spot in the lineup. The main difference is the 320 TPI cotton casing, blended with an aero-optimized profile, and a newly developed RR-S2 silica compound (the current CEDEX Aero tires use the RR-S compound). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vibe from the Aero Cotton is a classic feel (and looks) with modern aero advantages that CADEX employed in the Aero tire. That means a slightly taller, oval-shaped profile with thin sidewalls and a thicker midsection. CADEX claims the shape forms a more streamlined, seamless interface with its wheels as well as other brands’ hookless aero rims. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested.webp\" alt=\"Ronde van Vlaanderen 2025\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-Battle-Tested-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Ronde van Vlaanderen 2025 – 109th Edition – Bruges – Oudenaarde 269 km – 06/04/2025 – Paterberg – Max Walscheid (GER – Team Jayco AlUla) – Kelland O’Brien (AUS – Team Jayco AlUla) – photo Kei Tsuji/SprintCyclingAgency©2025</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Build: High TPI, Low Drag</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CADEX isn’t pushing the tech envelope with a 320 TPI cotton casing; we’ve seen higher tire thread counts for quite a while. Blending the ride feel of a supple, responsive, smooth tubular level casing and hookless tech. <span>Add in the new <strong>RR-S2 silica compound, </strong>which CADEX claims reduces rolling resistance by 30% compared to their previous rubber, and you’ve got a tire aimed at podiums and KOMs.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"7964\" height=\"5312\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-jpg.webp\" alt=\"CADEX Aero Cotton\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-jpg.webp 7964w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CADEX-Aero-Cotton-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/CADEX)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What the Tread?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread design plays it smart and doesn’t reinvent the wheel (tire). The center tread is a smooth strip for maximum efficiency. That smoothness is offset by micro-textured shoulders that promise better grip in the corners and efficient water clearing when the roads get slick. CADEX also dropped in a Race Shield Kevlar patch under the center tread for a bit of flat protection, which should help this stay competitive with modern race-day rubber that balances speed and durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Notable Details:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bead: </strong>Hybrid carbon-zylon bead keeps things secure on hookless rims.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tubeless-ready only</li>\n\n\n\n<li>72 PSI max pressure, which matches modern lower-pressure, wider-tire trends.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sizes/Weights:</strong> Available in 700x28c (278g) and 700x30c (305g)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> TBD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>CADEX hasn’t reinvented the tire here, but they might have polished the race-day formula with a blend of classic ride feel and modern aero tuning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t mounted them yet (or received them, for that matter), so we’ll reserve judgment on how they perform on real roads. But based on the spec sheet, the Aero Cotton looks like a tire designed to sit squarely on the cutting edge—especially if you’re already riding CADEX wheels and looking for the perfect fit-and-finish pairing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to know how it rides?</em> Stay tuned—we’ll be getting a pair to test soon.
