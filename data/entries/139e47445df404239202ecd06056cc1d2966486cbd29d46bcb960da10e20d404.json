Battery-powered 911s, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/a-great-idea-or-sacrilege-we-test-a-jaguar-e-type-converted-to-ev/\">E-Types</a>, Triumphs, and more have been around for a while, but the humble MGB has thus far been overlookedâ€¦ until now. UK-based MG specialists Frontline Developments has a rich history of restoring, modifying, and generally sprucing up MGBs, and has decided that now is the time to inject a cleaner, greener heart into what was once a British sportscar staple.</p>\n<p>The MG BEE EV is a neat little thing. Currently in prototype form, it's packing a 40 kWh battery attached to a 114 hp (85 kW) 162 lb ft (220 Nm) Hyper9 motor that sends power to the rear wheels via a five-speed Mazda Miata gearbox. Range is about 140 miles (225 km) if you drive sensibly, and charging takes about five hours. Frontline will build you one as a BEE GT (coupe), or Roadster should you wish to feel the wind in your beard as you roll along.</p>\n<p>Frontline Developments is well known in the MG world. Founded in 1991 by Tim Fenna, it started with gearbox swaps, then widened its business with suspension, brake, and even engine upgrades for customers wanting a little more go. The company offers full restorations, as well as its own special editions from time to time. Its LE50 and Abingdon editions came with beautiful aesthetics, twinned with more modern (and powerful) internal combustion engines. It's launching a V8-powered LE60 alongside the BEE for those who fancy old-school thrills.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973008#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973008&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"139e47445df404239202ecd06056cc1d2966486cbd29d46bcb960da10e20d404","category":"Tech"}
