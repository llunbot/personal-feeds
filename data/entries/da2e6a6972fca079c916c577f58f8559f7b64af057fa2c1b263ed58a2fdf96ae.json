Evolving the popular all-road bike with more aero and integrated road inspiration, while not losing its mixed-surface roots. It’s comfortable like an endurance road bike. Its fast and sleekly integrated like an aero road bike. And it has big enough tire clearance to fall into the fast gravel category. We’re calling it a modern aero all-road bike. A bike to ride fast and far, with almost no limits what type of roads you choose to explore…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Focus Paralane carbon aero all-road bike </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Focus Paralane carbon aero all-road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Focus)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as an endurance road racing bike built to handle gravel all-the way back in 2016, has some back around to the road thanks to plenty of other great gravel options in the lineup. Pick the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/focus-atlas-8-bikepacking-gravel-bike-gets-carbon-upgrade-with-boost-for-adventure/\" target=\"_blank\">Atlas in carbon</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/focus-all-new-atlas-aluminum-gravel-bike-wants-you-to-get-lost-maybe-even-to-lose/\" target=\"_blank\">alloy</a> if you want to go gravel adventuring. Focus haven’t actually scaled back the gravel capabilities of the Paralane. It’s just that in the last 7.5 years, what we used to call gravel clearance has almost become <em>de rigeur </em>for all-road bikes. I mean, plenty of modern road race bikes now have room for 32mm tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda feel like the old school road bike is dead in many riders’ eyes. We want to ride year round in any weather and comfortably on any road surface. And the path forward is a modern aero all-road bike like this new Focus Paralane.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Focus Paralane carbon aero all-road bike, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_angled.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious new bits are the fully integrated internal cable routing. And truncated NACA airfoil tube shapes for improved aerodynamic performance. But there’s still a classic 27.2 round seatpost, because often times comfort trumps incremental aero gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end-800x1067.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Focus Paralane carbon aero all-road bike, rear end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_rear-end.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end-800x1067.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Focus Paralane carbon aero all-road bike, front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_front-end.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus feels like the all-road sweet spot is 32mm tires, but there’s room for at least 35mm tires, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_fenders.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"593\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_fenders-800x593.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Focus Paralane carbon aero all-road bike, fenders\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_fenders-800x593.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_fenders-297x220.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_fenders-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_fenders-768x569.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_fenders.jpg 1350w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren’t the type to want to sit inside on the trainer, Focus has your back.
