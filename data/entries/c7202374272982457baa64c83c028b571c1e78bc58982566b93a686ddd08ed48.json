This time I’ll quote a different passage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad\nwriting. Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the\nwriter is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and\nnot a “party line”. Orthodoxy, of whatever colour, seems to demand\na lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to be found in\npamphlets, leading articles, manifestos, White papers and the\nspeeches of undersecretaries do, of course, vary from party to\nparty, but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in\nthem a fresh, vivid, homemade turn of speech. When one watches\nsome tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the\nfamiliar phrases — <em>bestial, atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained\ntyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder</em> — one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live\nhuman being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly\nbecomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker’s\nspectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no\neyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker\nwho uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance toward\nturning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming\nout of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be\nif he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is\nmaking is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again,\nhe may be almost unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when\none utters the responses in church. And this reduced state of\nconsciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate favourable to\npolitical conformity.</p>\n\n<p>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence\nof the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule\nin India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the\natom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments\nwhich are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not\nsquare with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus\npolitical language has to consist largely of euphemism,\nquestion-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages\nare bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the\ncountryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with\nincendiary bullets: this is called <em>pacification</em>. Millions of\npeasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the\nroads with no more than they can carry: this is called <em>transfer\nof population</em> or <em>rectification of frontiers</em>. People are\nimprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the\nneck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is\ncalled <em>elimination of unreliable elements</em>. Such phraseology is\nneeded if one wants to name things without calling up mental\npictures of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now consider <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/28/tim-cook-memo\">Cook’s memo</a>. Cook avoids most of the sins Orwell describes. He uses short, common words. He eschews hackneyed metaphors. He uses the active, not passive, voice — for the most part. His prayers and sympathies are “with everyone that’s been affected.” Who, exactly, has been affected? Affected how? By whom? Numerous examples come to mind, but not from Cook’s memo. Two Minneapolitans were affected, quite adversely, by being shot in the head and back at point blank range, in broad daylight, by unhinged ICE goons. <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/22/minnesota-5-year-old-ice-bait/\">A five-year-old boy</a> — himself a U.S.-born citizen — was affected when ICE agents apprehended his father, used the boy as bait to lure other family members, and is now being held in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/migrant-families-ice-detention-facility-texas\">notorious</a> detention center in Texas, a thousand miles away.</p>\n\n<p>The list is long, the stories searing. But Cook mentions nothing more specific than “everyone that’s been affected”. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them, indeed.</p>\n\n<p>“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook wrote. But by whom? The masked federal agents laying siege to Minneapolis, brutalizing its citizenry? Or the <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/minneapolis-clergy-arrest-protest-9.7058754\">thousands of law-abiding citizens</a> protesting the occupation of their neighborhoods, who are, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/m3otpjno0UQ?t=300\">in the words of Seth Meyers</a>, “deploying the most hurtful weapon of all, the bird”? Cook’s call for “deescalation” is meaningless without specifying which side he’s calling upon to change course, and there’s no weaker sauce than the weak sauce of “both sides”. Using words, not to make a point, but to <em>avoid</em> making a point while creating the illusion of having made one, is the true sin. From Orwell’s closing paragraph:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Political language — and with variations this is true of all\npolitical parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists — is designed\nto make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an\nappearance of solidity to pure wind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s colder in Minnesota, but the wind is gusting in Cupertino.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c7202374272982457baa64c83c028b571c1e78bc58982566b93a686ddd08ed48","category":"Tech"}
