The frame year, 2018, is the same year Roglic secured general classification wins in the Tour of the Basque Country, Tour of Romandie, and the Tour of Slovenia.</p>\n\n\n\nNot Supported\n\n\n\n<h2>Second-hand super bikes from Bike-room</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Tour de France in full swing, the best bikes in the world are on full display in a month-long battle of attrition that showcases the latest and greatest frames and components currently on the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most scenarios, normal riders would never be able to get their hands on one of these top-of-the-line race-tested machines.
