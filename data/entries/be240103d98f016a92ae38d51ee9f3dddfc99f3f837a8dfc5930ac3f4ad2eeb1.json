Apple this week released <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2525721/download-ios-18-1-1-right-now-to-fix-these-two-critical-security-flaws.html\">iOS and iPadOS 18.1.1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2525746/psa-update-your-mac-right-now-to-patch-this-actively-exploited-zero-day-flaw.html\">macOS 15.1.1</a>, and visionOS 2.1.1 to patch a pair of critical vulnerabilities that have already been exploited in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update appears to include only two security patches, but they’re extremely important. Both patches fix zero-day vulnerabilities that are known to have been exploited in attacks against Intel-based Macs. That doesn’t mean they haven’t been used to hack Apple silicon devices as well, just that Apple isn’t aware of any such attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both flaws were discovered by Clément Lecigne and Benoît Sevens of Google’s Threat Analysis Group and impact the <strong>JavaScriptCore</strong> and <strong>WebKit</strong> components of Apple’s operating systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both bugs allow hackers to exploit “maliciously crafted web content” to attack the system. The JavaScript bug allows “arbitrary code execution,” while the WebKit flaw opens the system to a cross-site scripting attack. In the Javascript patch (CVE-2024-44308), Apple fixed the issue with improved checks, while the WebKit fix (CVE-2024-44309) applies improved state management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For older devices, Apple also released iOS 17.7.2 for iPhones X and earlier, as well as iPadOS 17.7.2. Additionally, it rolled out Safari 18.1.2 for macOS Ventura and Sonoma. They all fix the same flaws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your iPhone, iPad, or Vision Pro, head over to the Settings app, then <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>. On a Mac, open System Settings, then <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>. And if you’ve read this far, go do it right now.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"be240103d98f016a92ae38d51ee9f3dddfc99f3f837a8dfc5930ac3f4ad2eeb1","category":"Apple"}
