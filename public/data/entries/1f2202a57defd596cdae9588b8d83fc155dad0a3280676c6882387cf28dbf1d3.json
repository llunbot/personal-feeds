Apple is also said to be planning a new 24-inch iMac that could be the first of its Macs to use its next-generation M3 chip.</p>\n\n<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air would be a new product category for Apple: a larger-screened laptop that costs less than a MacBook Pro. Apple's consumer-focused laptops—from the old PowerPC iBook to the first Intel MacBooks to the current MacBook Air—have all ranged between 11 and 13 inches. The 15- to 17-inch PowerBook and MacBook Pro models always required a step up in CPU and GPU power that drove the price up; the cheapest MacBook Air starts at $999, while the cheapest 16-inch MacBook Pro costs $2,499.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921932#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921932&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f2202a57defd596cdae9588b8d83fc155dad0a3280676c6882387cf28dbf1d3","category":"Tech"}
