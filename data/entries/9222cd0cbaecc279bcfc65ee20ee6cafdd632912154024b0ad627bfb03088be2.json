Diamond Shruumz does not provide a full list of ingredients. The term \"microdosing\" and other marketing used by Diamond Shruumz suggests the candies contain a psychedelic compound, but the company does not name any. To figure it out, the FDA has been analyzing multiple samples of Diamond Shruumz-brand candies, including chocolates, gummies, and candy cones. On Tuesday, the FDA reported finding the synthetic psychedelic compound 4-AcO-DMT in the company's Dark Chocolate Bar and its Birthday Cake Chocolate Bar.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033774#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033774&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9222cd0cbaecc279bcfc65ee20ee6cafdd632912154024b0ad627bfb03088be2","category":"Tech"}
