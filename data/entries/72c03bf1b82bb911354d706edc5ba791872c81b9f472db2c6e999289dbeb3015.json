At Crankworx Whistler this year, FiveTen and Dainese had some new and soon-to-come MTB shoes on display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FiveTen was showing some incoming shoes that will be released in Spring 2025. Most notably, the popular Freerider Pro shoe will be available with a BOA closure system! Dainese had several models of their shoes on display. The lineup includes two models for flat pedals, two for clip-in riders, and one incoming model designed for comfortable on or off-bike use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FiveTen Freerider Pro BOA and Updated Hellcats: </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Freerider-Pro-BOA-black.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Freerider-Pro-BOA-black.jpg\" alt=\"FiveTen Freerider Pro BOA, black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Freerider-Pro-BOA-black.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Freerider-Pro-BOA-black-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Freerider-Pro-BOA-black-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Freerider-Pro-BOA-black-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Freerider-Pro-BOA-black-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.adidas.com/us/men-five_ten\">FiveTen</a> </strong>was teasing some of their upcoming products at Crankworx Whistler this year. Info is scant at this point, but they were keen to get people excited about two revised models that will be announced next Spring. First up, the popular Freerider Pro shoe will soon be available with a BOA closure system. The Freerider Pro BOA is expected to launch in February 2025, so watch BikeRumor for future coverage when full details are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side.jpg\" alt=\"FiveTen Hellcat, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-side-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FiveTen has also revised the Hellcat shoe. The updated models now feature a stronger reinforced toe area for better protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-sole.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-sole.jpg\" alt=\"FiveTen Hellcat, sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-sole.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-sole-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-sole-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-sole-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FiveTen-Hellcat-sole-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hellcats will also come with more lugs on the outsole for improved off-bike traction. This model will be launching in Spring 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dainese Shoes – HG Acto and Acto PRO:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side.jpg\" alt=\"Dainese HG Acto MTB shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-shoe-side-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acto is a simple skate-style lace-up flat pedal shoe. It includes Dainese’s Z-Plate Bike insert in the sole which provides side-to-side support but allows flexibility front-to-back. The breathable upper fabric is reinforced with a rubber pattern on the sides for durability. TPU reinforcements on the heel and toe protect your feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, an EVA midsole ensures comfort and pedal sensitivity. On the outside, a Vibram XS Ride outsole features a compound designed to provide solid grip, while allowing for easy foot repositioning when necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HG Acto shoe sells for $160. Color options are green/black or black/black, and US sizes range from 6-13.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe.jpg\" alt=\"Dainese HG Acto Pro shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-shoe-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also designed for flat pedals, the Acto PRO shares the same Z-Plate Bike sole insert, EVA midsole, Vibram XS Ride outsole, and TPU heel and toe reinforcements as the Acto shoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system.jpg\" alt=\"Dainese HG Acto Pro, PER-FIT lace system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-Acto-Pro-PER-FIT-lace-system-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The PRO model adds Dainese’s PER-FIT (Precision Elasticated Retaining System) lace system. It features four elasticated bands across the top of the foot and a quick sliding lace, plus a Velcro top strap to ensure a snug fit width-wise. Dainese says the system wraps the instep area snugly and applies uniform pressure on the foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acto PRO also gets side panels with an auxetic pattern cut into them. This pattern allows for plenty of flexibility and unrestricted foot movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail price for the HG Acto Pro is $190. It comes in black/black only (note: the colorway pictured is not showing on Dainese’s website), and in sizes 6-13.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles.jpg\" alt=\"Dainese flat and clip-in soles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-shoes-flat-clip-soles-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This photo shows the Materia (clip-in) and the Acto (flat) soles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HG Materia and Materia PRO:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Materia-shoe-side.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Materia-shoe-side.jpg\" alt=\"Dainese HG Materia shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Materia-shoe-side.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Materia-shoe-side-297x163.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Materia-shoe-side-120x66.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Materia-shoe-side-768x422.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Image c.

The Itinera offers a balance between stiffness for good pedal support and flexibility for comfortable walking when off the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The midsole features Dainese/TCX’s ZPLATE BIKE technology. This tech places a Z-shaped thermoplastic support in the shoe that increases stability on the pedal by minimizing twisting or bending of the foot. However, the plate also allows for suitable walking flexibility.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An EVA midsole provides cushion and helps absorb impacts, and a 5mm thick Ortholite footbed ensures comfort through long rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Itinera-sole.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Itinera-sole.jpg\" alt=\"Dainese HG Itinera Flat, sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Itinera-sole.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Itinera-sole-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Itinera-sole-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dainese-HG-Itinera-sole-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The HG Itinera Flat features a Vibram Megagrip sole. The tread pattern was designed to allow excellent foot-to-pedal contact and to expel mud.
