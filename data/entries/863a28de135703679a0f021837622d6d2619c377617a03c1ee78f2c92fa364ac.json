In <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AS7Hj1mBMGM/mark-gurman\">\"Power On\" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that Apple \"still needs to perfect the algorithms and on-board sensors\" to bring the technology to market. Crucially, the company also needs to \"shrink it down to the size of a module that can fit in the small and thin package that is an Apple Watch.\" Gurman believes this process \"will take another three to seven years at least.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple began working on alternative glucose monitoring methods following its aquisition of RareLight in 2010. The company then used a startup called Avolante Health LLC to develop the technology at a secret facility before moving it to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/apple-secretive-team-working-on-experimental-tech/\">Exploratory Design Group (XDG)</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been conducting human trials for the past 10 years and seeks to be able to warn Apple Watch users if they are prediabetic to encourage lifestyle changes before diabetes develops. It is believed to be holding early discussions about getting regulatory approval for the technology.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-technologies/\">Health Technologies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/\">Apple Watch Blood Glucose Monitoring Likely Still 'Three to Seven Years' Away</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-blood-glucose-monitoring-likely-still-three-to-seven-years-away.2384829/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"863a28de135703679a0f021837622d6d2619c377617a03c1ee78f2c92fa364ac","category":"Apple"}
