Now, more than a year after release, Sony is announcing a line of replacementÂ faceplates in black and four other colors, alongside matching colored DualSense controllers.</p>\n<p>The console covers are listed for $55 on the PlayStation Direct shop and come in options fitted for both the standard console and the disc drive-free Digital Edition. Colored controller options are listed for $75, a small premium over the $70 white DualSense controller.</p>\n<p>The new console covers, <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/13/new-dualsense-wireless-controller-colors-arrive-next-month-followed-by-new-ps5-console-covers/\">announced this morning,</a> will arrive in 23 countries in two waves. \"Midnight Black\" and \"Cosmic Red\" colors will be released starting on January 21, 2022, and \"Nova Pink,\" \"Galactic Purple,\" and \"Starlight Blue\" will follow in the first half of 2022.
