The change means users will be able to log into the same WhatsApp account on up to four phones, instead of being limited to just one phone and multiple desktop devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the new feature, said to be rolling out to all users within the coming weeks, users' messages will be synced across multiple devices including other phones. So even if one device is switched off, they can access the app on other devices.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/03/whatsapp-transfer-chats-without-icloud/\">WhatsApp to Let Users Transfer Chats to Another iPhone Without Using iCloud</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-to-let-users-transfer-chats-to-another-iphone-without-using-icloud.2388507/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a56fec5ff9189abc212045146259d5594f404a34e2514b70281e3592bdb4ea1","category":"Apple"}
