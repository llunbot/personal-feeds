The Stemma S is aluminium with a four-bolt front plate and Wilier says is essentially a simpler version of its Stemma SL, it also uses the same headset covers as its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wilier/8894/wilier-filante-slr-wilier-aero-road-bike\" target=\"_self\">Filante SLR</a>, Wilier 0 SL and Cento10 bikes.</p>\n<p>It's a small thing, but we can all appreciate the premium aesthetics of integration even if it makes maintenance a bit more involved.</p>\n<p>[gallery:14]</p>\n<p>Wilier has also given the Garda clearance for the wider tyres that have come to dominate both road and peloton, with the disc version allowing for tyres up to 32mm and the rim version up to 28mm.</p>\n<p>The Garda's frame is made from a blend of carbon that Wilier calls NH-Mod, meaning a mixture of normal and high modulus carbon – the higher graded being more stiff – that helps keep the weight and the price down. The brand says the final frame comes in at 1,120g with the fork weighing 370g.</p>\n<h2>2022 Wilier Garda range and pricing</h2>\n<p>While the Garda has disc brake and rim brake models, there is only one setup available with the rim option. That's finished with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/10066/what-s-the-difference-between-shimanos-road-groupsets\" target=\"_self\">Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset</a> and Shimano RS100 wheels and it's the cheapest of the bunch by a long shot, coming in at £2,840.</p>\n<p>If discs are your thing though, there are technically six setups you can choose from with two for each of the main groupset manufacturers.</p>\n<p>[gallery:29]</p>\n<p>First there are the two Shimano Ultegra R8020-equipped models, with a further choice of Wilier NDR 38 KC wheels and Shimano RS171 wheels that take prices way up to £4,070 and £3,350 respectively.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/wilier/8894/wilier-filante-slr-wilier-aero-road-bike\">Wilier Filante SLR: Wilier launches new aero road bike</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/6894/gallery-wilier-s-greatest-bikes\">Gallery: the greatest Wilier bikes in history</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6486/wilier-expands-range-by-launching-first-wheelsets\">Wilier expands range by launching first wheelsets </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4343/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: the best bikes on the market from £729 to over £10,000</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 118: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe SRAM models come with its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sram/9405/sram-rival-etap-axs\" target=\"_self\">new wireless Rival AXS groupset</a>, with wheel options both coming in-house with that Wilier NDR 38 KC or Wilier RX 26, which take total up further to £4,680 and £4,070 respectively.</p>\n<p>Finally, at the top of the price list, are the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/6342/campagnolo-chorus-12-speed-groupset\" target=\"_self\">Campagnolo Chorus</a> models, with the same wheel choices as the SRAM they come in at £4,170 and £4,890.
