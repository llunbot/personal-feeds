Here are our highlights from what looks set to become a fixture in the custom bike show calendar.</p>\n<h2>Armour Cycles’ repaired Mercx MX Leader and chunky fixie</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Armour Cycles chunky street fixie\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Armour Cycles chunky street fixie\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This Armour Cycles fixie is made from oversized steel tubing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This “bonny but excessively stiff” modern fixie has been built by Armour Cycles for a “big lad who likes to shred”.</p>\n<p>The oversized steel frameset uses an unusually large 31.6mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a> (most steel road-going bikes have 27.2mm posts), boosting stiffness.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Armour Cycles chunky street fixie\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Armour Cycles chunky street fixie\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is future-proofed to accommodate a carbon fork should the hard shreddin’ owner so wish.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike has been built with an oversized head tube so the owner can switch to a carbon fork if they wish.</p>\n<p>A wide flat bar should provide plenty of oomph for punchy climbs around Edinburgh, while the ISM PN 3.1 saddle reflects the bike’s aggressive position (and rider’s personal taste).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Armour Cycles repaired Mercx\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Armour Cycles repaired Mercx\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Armour Cycles also carries out repair work.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Armour also repairs, restores and repaints frames.</p>\n<p>This Mercx MX Leader frameset has had its driveside chainstay replaced and a replica paintjob. It’s genuinely impossible to tell it’s not original.</p>\n<h2>A gravel tandem and a singlespeed fat bike – Broc Bikes’ wonderfully niche show debut</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Broc Bikes tandem\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Broc Bikes tandem\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A gravel bikepacking-bag equipped tandem – deliciously niche!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Broc Bikes is the new venture of Stuart Allan – a former fabricator at Scottish custom bike manufacturer, Shand Bicycles.</p>\n<p>Allan is best known in the Scottish cycling scene for devising the Badger Divide – a popular 338km gravel bikepacking route from Inverness to Glasgow – so you can be sure his new bikes will be up to the rigours of adventurous Highland rambling.</p>\n<p>His first two bikes to officially wear the Broc marque couldn’t be more different.</p>\n<p>The first is a gravel tandem frameset (a niche within a niche). This is designed to take 50mm-wide 700c <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Broc Bikes tandem\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Broc Bikes tandem\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Allan commissioned a custom frame bag to sit inside the rearmost triangle of his new tandem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The frameset holds a custom frame bag made by mechanic and part-time bag maker, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrvear/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Vear</a>. This double-decker bag can be split in half to decrease the capacity for shorter jollies.</p>\n<p>Allan suggested the bike will make its racing debut on the 200km-long version of the Dirty Reiver next spring. The possibility of riding a super randonneur series on it was also suggested.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Broc Bikes fat bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Broc Bikes fat bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Allan also customised an old Singular Puffin fat bike for the show.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Broc’s matching grey <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-fat-bike/\">fat bike</a> was originally a Singular Puffin that has been chopped in half and extended to modernise its geometry.</p>\n<p>The bike is built with a singlespeed drivetrain and is intended for year-round hassle-free rumbling.</p>\n<p>Allan says Broc Bikes will likely be a supplementary project that will sit alongside his work as a fabricator at a specialist wheelchair manufacturer. However, he bashfully invites enquiries if you’re interested in commissioning a bike.</p>\n<h2>C3Cycles’ surprisingly affordable cargo bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – C3Cycles cargo bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 (9 of 32)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> £4,575 for a UK-made custom electric cargo bike? That’s not to be sniffed at.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>C3Cycles is a small-scale cargo and custom bike manufacturer based on the outskirts of Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>Manufactured from 6082 aluminium and heat-treated in-house, each C3Cycles bike is made to customer specification.</p>\n<p>Despite the one-off construction, its bikes are surprisingly affordable.</p>\n<p>For example, this heavy-duty <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-cargo-bike/\">electric cargo bike</a> costs £4,575 as pictured – not bad for a UK-made bike with a solid do-it-all build. Non-assist bikes can be had for £3,400. Bikes are generally available with a six-week turnaround</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – C3Cycles cargo bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – C3Cycles cargo bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> C3Cycles uses a 24in front wheel on its cargo bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>C3Cycles uses as many off-the-shelf parts as possible.</p>\n<p>For example, while most cargo bikes have a 20in front wheel, few wheel manufacturers produce complete 20in wheels with disc hubs.</p>\n<p>C3Cycles instead opts for a 24in front wheel, which can be found easily new or second-hand. This is also said to improve the rollover of the bike on rougher terrain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – C3Cycles cargo bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – C3Cycles cargo bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This particular bike was designed to suit a little n’ large couple, so C3Cycles built in ample adjustability in the cockpit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This is all done with a view to easing long-term ownership costs.</p>\n<p>With few proprietary or niche parts, an owner should be able to take their bike into any bike shop and expect a relatively affordable service. This goes as far as ensuring internally routed cables are fully sleeved.</p>\n<h2>Straight Cut bikepacking luggage</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Straight Cut bikepacking luggage\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Straight Cut bikepacking luggage\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An all-white luggage setup would be useless in the mud, but it sure looks cool.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Based in a small workshop in Edinburgh, owner and chief seamster Ross O’Reilly has been producing custom and stock <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a> full-time under the Straight Cut label for six years now.</p>\n<p>In that time, he’s developed an array of designs and had his full range on show in a fetching all-white colourway at Brazin’.</p>\n<p>While white is a woefully impractical colour for Scottish bog bothering, it sure does look cool and shows off the impeccable quality of Straight Cut’s sewing work.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Straight Cut bikepacking luggage\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Straight Cut bikepacking luggage\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> O’Reilly’s stock designs can be customised to suit customer requests.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>O’Reilly’s stock designs can also be used as the basis for custom designs. He specialises in custom frame bags for bikes of all shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>While designed primarily with lightweight backpacking in mind, O’Reilly is working on a design for an ultralight rucksack that could work well for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a>. He’s also developing a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hip-packs/\">hip pack</a> that’s nearly ready for production.</p>\n<p>He encourages prospective buyers to pester him for additional details.</p>\n<h2>C.

This is a sustainable byproduct of the wine cork industry.</p>\n<p>Like a traditional leather saddle, the cork saddle must be ‘worn in’, eventually moulding to the shape of a rider’s butt.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Frame Cycles titanium saddle\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Frame Cycles titanium saddle\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Different uppers with moulded pockets or recycled rubber particles have been tested.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Frame Cycles is also experimenting with designs that incorporate pockets or larger chunks of cork to improve the shock-absorbancy of the saddle. Cork grips are also in testing.</p>\n<p>The cork is treated with a water-based waterproof coating. The same coating is used on cork flooring and improves durability.</p>\n<p>Expected to be available from September onwards, the saddle will retail for around £100 (international pricing TBC).</p>\n<h2>Rothair Cycles’ personal fixed-gear shredder</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Rothair Cycles fixed gear bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Rothair Cycles fixed gear bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We like fixies.

These make puncture repairs or gearing swaps much more complicated on a mudguard-equipped bike because the wheel fouls the guards.</p>\n<p>Finlayson’s new bike is built using a pair of new old stock forward-facing Campagnolo semi-sloping dropouts, so the wheel moves forward in these dropouts when being removed.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Rothair Cycles fixed gear bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Rothair Cycles fixed gear bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bi-laminate head tube is beautiful.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>His new bike also uses a skinny steel fork. This should improve front-end compliance versus the old bike’s chunky carbon fork and also give him the option to mount additional luggage for longer adventures.</p>\n<p>A pair of colour-matched alloy mudguards finish the build.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing custom bikes, Finlayson is now offering frame-building classes.</p>\n<h2>Lightweight alloy to make a comeback with Stout Cycles?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Hrok Cycles alloy road bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Hrok Cycles alloy road bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hrok is the new venture of Russell Stout.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Rounding out the who’s-who of former Shand contemporaries is Stout Cycles/Hrok Cycles – the new venture of former Shand co-owner, Russell Stout.</p>\n<p>Stout was keen to stress his air-hardening 7000-series aluminium frames are far from ready for customers to purchase – his manufacturing experience is focused primarily on steel and he’s still “finding the limits of alloy”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Hrok Cycles alloy road bike\" title=\"Brazin handmade bicycle show Scotland 2023 – Hrok Cycles alloy road bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s nothing quite like the clean front end of a classic rim brake frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Brazin’ Handmade was instead an opportunity to share his new venture and gauge interest for future semi-custom models.</p>\n<p>We were particularly drawn to his almost old-school lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes/\">alloy road bike</a>.</p>\n<p>With generous tyre clearances, a classic double-triangle design, good ol’ <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-brake-road-bikes/\">rim brakes</a> and unfussy internal cable routing, this bike picks up where the likes of the Cannondale CAAD12 left off.</p>\n<p>We will be watching this venture closely.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0e05ae56ff66b6cd41a824d536597e134ddb7a9c514e333eb15bd4ab5f4c123a","category":"Cycling"}
