It’s the first time we’ve seen that, at this price point from DJI. Additionally, it also a new ‘Active Track 360’ feature, that lets you create more dynamic ActiveTrack movements mid-ride (or mid-run, or mid-kayak, etc…).</p>\n<p>Of course, as always, I’m here to see how well these things hold up in real-life. And no better way to do that than test it against what has become The Gauntlet for testing the autonomous tracking capabilities of drones.</p>\n<p>To see how well this drone holds up (and in this case, many times over), hit the play button up above. This little guy doesn’t give up easily.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"fd6ca0a05b05607b3b99c3cfb945d957b42fed1c22dfd6f7faabe5f4c61f25d1","category":"Cycling"}
