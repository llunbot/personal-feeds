{"title":"Voodoo’s value-packed Bizango hardtail gets longer and slacker but retains a fun and agile character","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/voodoo-bizango-2022/","date":1629414102000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/Voodoo-Bizango-2021-hardtail-mountain-bike-74a5338.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>Voodoo’s Bizango is the Halfords brand’s flagship hardtail. For the 2022 release it receives an overhaul, making it, Voodoo says, a fast and agile trail hardtail that could appeal equally to first-time mountain bike buyers and more experienced riders.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-2000/\" target=\"_blank\">The best mountain bikes under £2,000</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Top-five hardtail mountain bikes</a></li>\n</ul><p>When we <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/voodoo-bizango-29er-2018-review/\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed the 2018 Voodoo Bizango</a>, we found it fantastic value for money and a very capable hardtail. While the bike has had an overhaul in geometry and components, it is still a bargain and comes ready to take on even burlier terrain.</p>\n<h2>Voodoo Bizango frame</h2>\n<p>The low-slung triple-butted frame is available in four sizes, all with 29in wheels and routing for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a>.</p>\n<p>A 120mm Suntour Radion suspension fork takes care of bump-smoothing duties, with Shimano’s Deore 1×11 drivetrain providing a wide range of gearing.</p>\n<p>The new Bizango gets the lower-longer-slacker treatment, although Voodoo is careful to note its relatively conservative numbers compared to some hardcore hardtails.</p>\n<p>The company says it can tackle steep and technical terrain while retaining a fast and fun character on mellower trails. For UK riding and especially trail centres, then, it should be just right.</p>\n<h2>Voodoo Bizango geometry</h2>\n<p>A size large Bizango 2022 has 461mm reach, which is just 9mm shorter than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-trek-roscoe/\" target=\"_blank\">recently launched Roscoe from Trek</a> (a bike at the upper end of aggressive hardtail geometry).</p>\n<p>Chainstay length is 435mm across the sizes (5mm longer than the Roscoe), which is neither excessively long nor short. As Voodoo says, the Bizango is for a bit of everything and not about pushing the limits of geometry.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the frame’s revised angles aren’t at the extreme end of the spectrum, but they position the bike in the ‘hardcore hardtail’ category.</p>\n<p>The new Bizango’s head angle is 1.5 degrees slacker than the previous version, at 66.5 degrees. Meanwhile, its seat angle is now 74.5­ degrees.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Bizango is kitted out with a 120mm suspension fork and 1×11 gearing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Voodoo</i></span></div>\n<h2>Voodoo Bizango spec</h2>\n<p>The Bizango features a range of quality components in an almost unbeatable package at this price point.</p>\n<p>The bike’s 1×11 Shimano Deore M5100 drivetrain comes with a 32-tooth chainring and an 11-51 cassette, providing a wide range of gearing for most situations. Meanwhile, Shimano MT200 brakes take care of stopping duties.</p>\n<p>Its 29in×2.25in Maxxis Ardent tyres are fast-rolling numbers that should perform well on a trail centre ride. For more aggressive riding, as we noted in our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/voodoo-bizango-29er-2018-review/\" target=\"_blank\">review of the previous model</a>, an upgrade to something a little wider and with a deeper tread might be advised.</p>\n<p>Suntour’s 120mm air-sprung <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/sr-suntour-radion-rld-fork-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Radion fork</a> is capable and performs well for a budget fork; you won’t find much better in this price range. Rebound adjustment, lockout and a 15×110mm thru-axle are signs of a solid package.</p>\n<p>For a bit of comfort in the uphills, Voodoo says it has worked with WTB on a special edition Volt saddle with added gel inserts.</p>\n<p>The size small bike has a 760mm handlebar, with the other sizes all coming with wide 780mm handlebars – a significant improvement over the narrow bars on the old model. Stem length is 45mm across the sizes.</p>\n<h2>Voodoo Bizango models</h2>\n<p>Voodoo bikes are available from Halfords stores in the UK. The Bizango comes in four sizes and two build options, the Bizango and the Bizango Pro.</p>\n<h3>Voodoo Bizango</h3>\n<p>The Bizango has 29in wheels and 120mm of front suspension travel.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame</strong>: Triple-butted aluminium with 141mm Boost QR rear axle</li>\n<li><strong>Sizes</strong>: S, M, L, XL</li>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong>: 120mm Suntour Radion Air Spring – 15×110mm thru-axle</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing</strong>: Shimano Deore M5100 1×11 – 11-51 cassette, 32t chainset</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes</strong>: Shimano MT200</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres</strong>: Maxxis Ardent 29in×2.25in</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels</strong>: Voodoo 29in with 24mm internal tubeless compatible rims</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle</strong>: WTB Volt custom spec with added gel insert</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £750</li>\n</ul><h3>Voodoo Bizango Pro</h3>\n<p>A higher-spec Pro model features upgraded brakes, fork and tyres but still has a bargain price tag.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame</strong>: Triple-butted aluminium with 12×148mm Boost thru-axle</li>\n<li><strong>Sizes</strong>: S, M, L, XL</li>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong>: 130mm RockShox 35 Gold – 15×110mm thru-axle</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing</strong>: Shimano Deore M5100 1×11 – 11-51 cassette, 32t chainset</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes</strong>: Shimano MT410</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres</strong>: Front – Maxxis High Roller II MaxxTerra EXO TR 29in×2.3in / Rear – Maxxis Rekon EXO TR 29in×2.25in</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels</strong>: Voodoo 29in with 24mm internal tubeless compatible rims</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle</strong>: WTB Volt Medium custom spec with added gel insert</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £925</li>\n</ul>","author":"James McKnight","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a045fa134779d508f56477064dcd5142d3bf036ec38ccd3772bf57c7e69edcc8","category":"Cycling"}
