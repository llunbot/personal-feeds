The memo continues, “Russian professional hacking\ngroups are employing the ‘linked devices’ features to spy on\nencrypted conversations.” It notes that <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger\">Google has\nidentified</a> Russian hacking groups who are “targeting Signal\nMessenger to spy on persons of interest.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s not a weakness in Signal’s cryptography, it’s a hole in their device-mirroring setup. From that <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger\">Google Threat Intelligence post</a>, published last month:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most novel and widely used technique underpinning\nRussian-aligned attempts to compromise Signal accounts is the\nabuse of the app’s legitimate “<a href=\"https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320551-Linked-Devices\">linked devices</a>” feature that\nenables Signal to be used on multiple devices concurrently.\nBecause linking an additional device typically requires scanning a\nquick-response (QR) code, threat actors have resorted to crafting\nmalicious QR codes that, when scanned, will link a victim’s\naccount to an actor-controlled Signal instance. If successful,\nfuture messages will be delivered synchronously to both the victim\nand the threat actor in real-time, providing a persistent means to\neavesdrop on the victim’s secure conversations without the need\nfor full-device compromise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You’d have to be a bit of a doofus to fall for such a phishing attack if you were in a national security leadership position, but, well, our national security leadership positions are <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/trump-admin-included-goldberg-in-yemen-war-plan-signal-group\">currently occupied</a> by what the Russians call “useful idiots”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/pentagon-signal-linked-devices\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"46811637d4db815f0da90f61e53a959a054598d3205e966d153219c17c1a5068","category":"Tech"}
