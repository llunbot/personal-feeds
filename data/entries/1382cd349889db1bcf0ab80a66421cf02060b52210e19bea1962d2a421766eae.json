{"title":"Now open — AWS Mexico (Central) Region","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-mexico-central-region/","date":1736864791000,"content":"<p>In February 2024, we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/aws/new-aws-region-in-mexico-is-in-the-works/\">announced</a> plans to expand <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> infrastructure in Mexico. Today, I’m excited to announce the general availability of the AWS Mexico (Central) Region with three Availability Zones and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints\">API code</a> <strong>mx-central-1</strong>. This new <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/\">AWS Region</a> is the first AWS infrastructure Region in Mexico and adds to our growing presence in Latin America.</p> \n<p>The AWS Region in Mexico represents a significant commitment to the country’s digital future. AWS is planning to invest more than $5 billion in Mexico over 15 years. This AWS Region will provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies, including cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities with purpose-built processors, while supporting Mexico’s growing digital economy. With this effort, AWS will support an average of more than 7,000 full-time equivalent jobs annually in Mexico, adding more than $10 billion to Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP). AWS has also launched a $300,000 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/aws-incommunities/\">AWS InCommunities</a> Fund in Queretaro to help local groups, schools, and organizations initiate new community projects.</p> \n<div>\n <a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/12/09/mexico-fine-arts-feat-img.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/12/09/mexico-fine-arts-feat-img.png\" alt=\"mexico city\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" /></a>\n <p>Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City</p>\n</div> \n<p>The AWS Mexico (Central) Region provides organizations in Mexico with a new option to run their workloads and store data locally. Organizations that need data residency capabilities, enhanced performance with lower latency, or robust security standards can now use infrastructure located in Mexico.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS in Mexico</strong></span><br /> AWS has operated infrastructure in Mexico since 2020. The infrastructure includes seven <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a> edge locations, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/\">AWS Outposts</a>, and strategic offerings such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/01/aws-local-zones-lagos-lima-queretaro/\">AWS Local Zones in Queretaro</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/locations/\">AWS Direct Connect</a>. These infrastructure offerings help customers run low-latency applications while maintaining secure connectivity.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Performance and Innovation</strong></span><br /> The AWS Mexico (Central) Region brings AWS infrastructure and services closer to local customers. With this new Region, AWS provides lower latency for customers in Mexico compared to using other AWS Regions. Customers will also be able to use our innovation in purpose-built processors, notably <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/\">AWS Graviton,</a> that delivers up to 40% better price performance compared to x86-based <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon EC2</a> instances across diverse workloads.</p> \n<p>This technological advantage extends to our cutting-edge AI and ML capabilities, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Advanced ML infrastructure with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/\">AWS Trainium</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/\">AWS Inferentia</a> for scalable generative AI deployment.</li> \n <li>Purpose-built processors optimized for cloud workloads to deliver best price-performance.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><strong>Security and Compliance</strong></span><br /> AWS provides <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security/\">comprehensive security capabilities</a> with support for 143 security standards and compliance certifications, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-dss-level-1-faqs/\">PCI-DSS</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/\">HIPAA</a>/<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html\">HITECH</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/\">FedRAMP</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/\">GDPR</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/\">FIPS 140-2</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/nist/\">NIST</a> 800-171. All AWS customers own their data, choose where to store it, and decide if/when to move it. This means customers storing content in the AWS Mexico (Central) Region have the assurance that their content will not leave Mexico, unless they chose to move it.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS Customers in Mexico</strong></span><br /> Leading Mexican organizations are already achieving significant results with AWS. Companies such as <a href=\"https://aeromexico.com/\">Aeroméxico</a>, <a href=\"https://www.santander.com.mx/\">Banco Santander Mexico</a>, <a href=\"https://cinepolis.com/\">Cinépolis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gruposalinas.com/\">Grupo Salinas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kavak.com\">Kavak</a>, <a href=\"https://www.palaceresorts.com/\">Palace Resorts</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vector.com.mx/\">Vector Casa de Bolsa</a> are running mission-critical workloads on AWS.
