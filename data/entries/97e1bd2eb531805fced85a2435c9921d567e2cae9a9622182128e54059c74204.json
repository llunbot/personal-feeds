When Apple faced similar requirements in Russia, the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/apple-to-offer-government-approved-apps-russia/\">agreed to show users a prompt</a> during device setup to install government-approved apps. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe move was a rare exception to Apple's strict control over pre-installed software, coming some years before a barrage of regulatory demands from the likes of the EU that have since forced Apple to open up its platforms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth Apple and Google are showing resistance to India's proposal, according to sources familiar with the matter cited by the media outlet. Google, whose Android operating system powers more than 90% of India's roughly 700 million smartphones, is actively pushing back against the initiative.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring the discussions, government officials explored implementing policy mandates or legal measures to ensure compliance. Beyond pre-installation, they also requested that their apps be available for download outside the company's app stores from third-party sources without triggering \"untrusted source\" warnings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe push comes as India seeks greater regulatory control over global tech companies. The situation is particularly complex given India's growing importance to both companies. Apple has significantly expanded iPhone production in India, which now accounts for more than 14% of global output, while Google has plans for major investments in smartphone assembly in the country.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-pressed-pre-install-gov-apps-india/\">Apple Pressed by India to Pre-Install Government Apps on iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pressed-by-india-to-pre-install-government-apps-on-iphones.2447947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"97e1bd2eb531805fced85a2435c9921d567e2cae9a9622182128e54059c74204","category":"Apple"}
