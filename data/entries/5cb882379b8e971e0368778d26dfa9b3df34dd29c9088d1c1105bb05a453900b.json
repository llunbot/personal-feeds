The idea is more comfort securing the foot in your shoe, but with conventional laces it’s not always so practically easy to create the perfect tension on different zones of the shoe. But now, with 2 dial closures, road cyclists can dial-in the fit of the combined toe box and midfoot, separately from the instep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why not a Boa dial?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2.jpg\" alt=\"Udog Cento road shoes, new custom dial-retention fit stiff carbon road cycling shoes, Tension Wrap System 2.0 detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Tension-Wrap-System-v2-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking with Udog founder Alberto Fonte, they chose to develop their own Micro Twist dial for a few key reasons. First off, dial systems can be relatively restrictive, with Boa somewhat dictating what laces, lacing layouts &amp; interfaces are possible, especially for smaller manufacturers. So by going their own, Udog could create the retention exactly how they wanted it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant using woven textile laces with high-strength hi-mod polyethylene (<em>aka Dyneema</em>), instead of plastic or reinforced wires. And lacing them exclusively through webbing loops for smoother action and better durability than plastic guides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front.jpg\" alt=\"Udog Cento road shoes, new custom dial-retention fit stiff carbon road cycling shoes, front pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_front-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The freedom also let Udog put a single dial on the middle of the tongue for even symmetrical tensioning the front of the foot, and protected from crash damage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pair that with a single side dial connected to a long instep strap. Even, comfortable pressure across the top of the tongue, and a solid heel lock. Plus, it’s easier access while pedaling to micro adjust on-the-go.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial.jpg\" alt=\"Udog Cento road shoes, new custom dial-retention fit stiff carbon road cycling shoes, Micro Twist dial detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_Micro-Twist-dial-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As to the dials themselves, Udog wanted a larger diameter dial that was easier to operate with or without gloves. And they were able to find a solution with lower stack height than other top premium dials on the market. The result is a soft ergonomic rubber dial, 30mm in diameter, and just 10mm tall overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top.jpg\" alt=\"Udog Cento road shoes, new custom dial-retention fit stiff carbon road cycling shoes, top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_studio-top-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beside the new closure for the Udog Cento, much of the remainder of the tech is shared with their other road shoes – with a “generous toe box and a deep heel cup”. The upper is a soft laser-perforated synthetic microfiber, with tougher TPU reinforcements at the toe &amp; heel for added durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cima-stiff-carbon-composite-sole-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cima-stiff-carbon-composite-sole-detail.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cima-stiff-carbon-composite-sole-detail.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cima-stiff-carbon-composite-sole-detail-297x173.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cima-stiff-carbon-composite-sole-detail-800x467.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cima-stiff-carbon-composite-sole-detail-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cima-stiff-carbon-composite-sole-detail-768x448.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Underneath is the same 3-bolt “ultra-stiff high carbon composite outsole” as found on Udog’s Cima lace-up road shoes. With a stiffness index of “11”, for what that is worth. ‘<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o\" target=\"_blank\">These go to eleven</a></em>‘. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, directional ventilation channels keep your feet cool. Sliding titanium nuts allow for 5mm of front-to-back cleat adjustment. And then on the outside, non-replaceable rubber heel &amp; toe tread caps give a bit of walking grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Udog Cento – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side.jpg\" alt=\"Udog Cento road shoes, new custom dial-retention fit stiff carbon road cycling shoes, side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Udog-Cento-custom-dial-retention-fit-stiff-carbon-road-cycling-shoes_side-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Udog Cento carbon road shoes are technically available now only as a pre-order.
