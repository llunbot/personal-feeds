The seamless upper is made from mesh and TPS with “zonal reinforcement to maximize lockdown and comfort.” To put it simply, the upper is designed so it won’t stretch when you’re pulling against the pedals with all your watts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the second BOA dial, the Torch 3.0 is actually slightly heavier than the 2.0, and checks in at 288g for a 42 shoe. I’ve tested a few Specialized road shoes over the years, and in terms of comfort, the Torch 3.0 is my favorite yet. There’s no pressure on the top of the instep, and between the internal heel counter and BOA dial layout, the fit is secure without having to be overly-snug. Sizing seems to run true, with them perhaps running a tad long in the toe. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-224_SHOE_TORCH-30-RD-SHOE-PRPORCD-LMSTN-44_PAIR-Large-2.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-224_SHOE_TORCH-30-RD-SHOE-PRPORCD-LMSTN-44_PAIR-Large-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Torch 3.0 pink\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-224_SHOE_TORCH-30-RD-SHOE-PRPORCD-LMSTN-44_PAIR-Large-2.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-224_SHOE_TORCH-30-RD-SHOE-PRPORCD-LMSTN-44_PAIR-Large-2-297x162.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-224_SHOE_TORCH-30-RD-SHOE-PRPORCD-LMSTN-44_PAIR-Large-2-800x436.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-224_SHOE_TORCH-30-RD-SHOE-PRPORCD-LMSTN-44_PAIR-Large-2-120x65.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-224_SHOE_TORCH-30-RD-SHOE-PRPORCD-LMSTN-44_PAIR-Large-2-768x418.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>These wild Purple Orchid/Limestone Torch 3.0s were included in the press kit, but aren’t currently on the Specialized site. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Priced at $250, the Torch 3.0 shoes are currently available in black or white, and in sizes 36-49, with half sizes from 38.5 to 46.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Body Geometry sole construction and footbeds are ergonomically designed and scientifically tested to boost power, increase efficiency, and reduce the chance of injury by optimizing hip, knee, and foot alignment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unidirectional Carbon sole engineered to be stiff, yet light with a large rubber heel and toe for off-the-bike traction.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dual BOA Li2 dials for dual direction micro adjustments and pop release</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seamless upper constructed from mesh, TPU and with zonal reinforcement to maximise lockdown and comfort</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internal heel counter provides a supportive and secure heel fit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Three-bolt cleat pattern fits all major road pedals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Approximate weight: 288g (1/2 pair, Size 42)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Torch 2.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-334_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-WHT-44_PAIR-Large-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-334_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-WHT-44_PAIR-Large-1-800x513.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Torch 2.0 White\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-334_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-WHT-44_PAIR-Large-1-800x513.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-334_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-WHT-44_PAIR-Large-1-297x190.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-334_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-WHT-44_PAIR-Large-1-120x77.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-334_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-WHT-44_PAIR-Large-1-768x493.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-334_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-WHT-44_PAIR-Large-1.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-304_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-BLK-44_PAIR-Large-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-304_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-BLK-44_PAIR-Large-1-800x513.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Torch 2.0 black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-304_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-BLK-44_PAIR-Large-1-800x513.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-304_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-BLK-44_PAIR-Large-1-297x190.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-304_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-BLK-44_PAIR-Large-1-120x77.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-304_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-BLK-44_PAIR-Large-1-768x493.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/61023-304_SHOE_TORCH-20-RD-SHOE-BLK-44_PAIR-Large-1.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the 3.0 and remove one of the BOA dials and change some materials, and you get the new Torch 2.0.

Also, instead of the traditional BOA lace on the 3.0, the 2.0 gets an Li2 dial with Dyneema soft lace cables with soft woven guides.
