To provide an idea of just how thin this would be, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-air-mockups/\">we've mocked up what such a device would look like</a> compared to the current iPhone 16 Pro Max at 8.25mm and the 13-inch iPad Pro at just 5.1mm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iPad-Pro-vs-iPhone-17-Air-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn other iPhone 17 rumors, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/alleged-iphone-17-air-shell/\">alleged photo of a pair of rear shells</a> for an upcoming iPhone model appeared this week, with the model presumably being the iPhone 17 Air considering it appears to only feature one rear camera. The unique design includes a horizontal bar across the top of the rear shell, so we'll have to see whether or not this turns out to be accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Here Are Apple's Full Release Notes for iOS 18.3</h2>\r<br />\nApple seeded release candidate versions of iOS 18.3 and related updates this week, suggesting a full public release is likely to come next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18.3-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn addition to previously discussed changes around Apple Intelligence notifications summaries, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-release-notes/\">iOS 18.3 brings several other changes</a> including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-new-visual-intelligence-features/\">improvements to the visual intelligence feature</a> for the Camera Control on iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone SE 4 Leak Shows Dynamic Island, Casts Doubt on Rumored 'iPhone 16E' Name</h2>\r<br />\nNoted mobile phone leaker Evan Blass this week shared some information indicating <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/new-ipad-air-models-with-m3-chip-leak/\">near-term updates for the iPhone SE, iPad, and iPad Air</a>, but the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/iphone-se-4th-gen-leak/\">most intriguing tidbits relate to the next iPhone SE</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-SE-4-Single-Camera-Thumb-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nDespite a recent rumor that Apple could call the new model the \"iPhone 16E,\" code leaked by Blass refers to the device as \"iPhone SE (4th Gen).\" That could be a placeholder, but it still casts more uncertainty on the 16E naming possibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA purported image of the upcoming devices also depicts the fourth-generation iPhone SE as having a Dynamic Island rather than a notch at the top of the display. There have been conflicting rumors about which way the next iPhone SE will go on that front, so we'll have to wait and see on that one as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 19 Rumored to Feature Redesigned Camera App Inspired by visionOS</h2>\r<br />\niOS 19 will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/\">redesigned Camera app inspired by visionOS</a>, according to a recent video from Jon Prosser, host of the YouTube channel Front Page Tech.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-19-Alleged-Camera-App-Render.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"797\" />\r<br />\nProsser obtained video of the alleged new Camera app, but he elected to share his own re-created images to protect his sources. The images reveal that the app will allegedly gain translucent menus for various camera controls, with the design of these menus looking very similar to the visionOS interface on the Apple Vision Pro headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Powerbeats Pro 2 Coming Soon: Apple to Announce Them 'Imminently'</h2>\r<br />\nIn September, Apple said that it would be launching Powerbeats Pro 2 in 2025, and it appears the wireless earbuds are coming very soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/apple-power-beats-pro-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nIn his <em>Power On</em> newsletter this week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/19/when-to-expect-powerbeats-pro-2/\">Powerbeats Pro 2 are \"due imminently.\"</a> In addition to Apple filing the Powerbeats Pro 2 in regulatory databases last month, Gurman said Apple is planning to hold product briefings with the media \"in a week or so\" to go over the new features of the wireless earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jan-23-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/25/top-stories-iphone-17-iphone-se-4-rumors/\">Top Stories: iPhone 17 and iPhone SE 4 Rumors, iOS 18.3 Incoming, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-17-and-iphone-se-4-rumors-ios-18-3-incoming-and-more.2448089/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc89197f7a9627c45bad3110fe0c9c8812dde565bd26a8c33bb510b2b618b4b9","category":"Apple"}
