A sliding yellow clip pushes up to lock the cables into place and can be pulled up to add length. With the clip at its highest point the 19.7 inch (50cm) cable that in reality can be stretched to about 17 inches (44cm) due to the holding clip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little fiddly at first, it doesn’t take long to master fitting the cable back into its resting place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is robust enough to be used as a carrying handle when secured using the clip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a cable with you always makes any power bank a more convenient and efficient solution. A built-in cable means you should never leave without one. The Ark Pro’s separate but attachable cable should work just as well without any fear of breakage—although you’ll need to remember to fit it back when you get up and go after charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a small smart display to inform you of key battery info, including how fast it’s charging your devices, how long it will take to recharge itself, plus the health and operating temperature of the battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power bank is in a classic pillar shape, measuring 6.1 x 2.6 x 2.4 inches (15.5 x 6.5 x 6cm), and weighs 24oz (680g). You wouldn’t want to stash this in your trouser pocket or handbag, but it’s a lot of power to carry in your backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Convenient as cables might be, a power bank will always first be judged on its battery capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alogic Ark Pro features a 27600mAh (Milliamp Hours) battery with a 99.36Wh (Watt Hours) rating. This is a sweet spot for portable power banks as the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has set a 100Wh limit on batteries that can be carried into a aircraft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That level of power is about right to give a MacBook Pro around a full charge, and this was borne out in our tests. We filled a 14-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro from 0% to 100% but no further on a second run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got a slightly tighter squeeze from the minimally higher capacity <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2345205/anker-prime-27650mah-power-bank-250w-review-portable-power-for-your-macbook.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank</a>.

This PD 3.1 charge is enough to fast charge Apple’s top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, although you’ll need to use Apple’s own proprietary charging cable to enable that fast-charge. That’s an Apple limitation, not one of the power bank’s maker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a USB-A port for legacy devices, with a maximum power output of 22.5W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using one USB-C and the USB-A ports together and you can output 140W and 22.5W for a total 162.5W power. Use all three ports and you’ll have access to 65W + 65W + 22.5W (152.5W maximum).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ark Pro can recharge itself—using its or another cable—at an impressive 140W.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Alogic-Ark-Pro-Power-Bank-Front-Rear_Studio.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Alogic Ark Pro Power Bank front and rear views\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Alogic-Ark-Pro-Power-Bank-Front-Rear_Studio.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Alogic-Ark-Pro-Power-Bank-Front-Rear_Studio.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Alogic-Ark-Pro-Power-Bank-Front-Rear_Studio.jpg?resize=768%2C603&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Alogic-Ark-Pro-Power-Bank-Front-Rear_Studio.jpg?resize=1200%2C942&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Alogic-Ark-Pro-Power-Bank-Front-Rear_Studio.jpg?resize=1536%2C1206&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"942\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Alogic</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alogic Ark Pro is priced at <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/ark-pro-27-600mah-power-bank-with-160w-usb-charging\">$129.99</a>, <a href=\"https://alogic.co.uk/products/ark-pro-27-600mah-power-bank-with-160w-usb-charging\">£129.99</a>, <a href=\"https://au.alogic.co/products/ark-pro-27-600mah-power-bank-with-160w-usb-charging\">AU$229.95</a> and <a href=\"https://eu.alogic.co/products/ark-pro-27-600mah-power-bank-with-160w-usb-charging\">€169,99</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is notably cheaper than the similarly specced and sized Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">$179.99</a>), which doesn’t come with an attachable cable but does win out with a higher maximum 250W output vs the Ark Pro’s 160W total possible simultaneous output.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alogic Ark Pro is a well-priced high-capacity laptop power bank that comes with a reliable and robust attachable cable that makes it a convenient and powerful travel companion.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3c4ce306bee31355f92f8447ecad62c8983b04ee491d827bdf44f7e0a2637b66","category":"Apple"}
