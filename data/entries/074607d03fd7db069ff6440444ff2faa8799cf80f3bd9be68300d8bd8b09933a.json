There are a few features that Apple has yet to implement, such as Universal Control and support for IDs in the Wallet app. Universal Control will let multiple Macs and iPads be controlled with the same keyboard and mouse, and Apple recently said that the feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-delays-universal-control/\">will come out in the spring</a>. Based on a lack of signs of these features in this first beta, it appears Apple will hold off on support for them until iOS 15.4.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for digital IDs in the Wallet app, that's something that has been in the works since June. Arizona, Georgia, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah are expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-shares-us-states-adopting-wallet-ids/\">the first states</a> to implement digital ID support, and Florida is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/14/florida-digital-id-apple-wallet-app-plans/\">also in talks</a> to support the feature.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/17/ios-15-3-beta-1/\">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 15.3 and iPadOS 15.3 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-15-3-and-ipados-15-3-to-developers.2328046/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yRKUBeL36sI:nUrbw4AwSqc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yRKUBeL36sI:nUrbw4AwSqc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"074607d03fd7db069ff6440444ff2faa8799cf80f3bd9be68300d8bd8b09933a","category":"Apple"}
