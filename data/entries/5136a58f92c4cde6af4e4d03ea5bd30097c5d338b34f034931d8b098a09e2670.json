On its debut flight, the new rocket delivered a commercial lunar lander to an on-target orbit. The next Vulcan mission, which ULA calls Cert-2, will be the rocket's second certification flight. The Space Force requires ULA to complete two successful flights of the Vulcan rocket before entrusting it to launch national security satellites.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038450#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038450&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5136a58f92c4cde6af4e4d03ea5bd30097c5d338b34f034931d8b098a09e2670","category":"Tech"}
