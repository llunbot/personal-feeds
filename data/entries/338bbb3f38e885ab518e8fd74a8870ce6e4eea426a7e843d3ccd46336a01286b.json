This brings the company's <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-discontinues-hybrid-technology-lakefield-processors\">discontinued</a> 2020 <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/press-kits/lakefield/\">Lakefield</a> design concept firmly into the mainstream.</p>\n<p>Big.little designs run time-sensitive tasks on bigger, hotter performance cores while running background tasks on slower but much less power-hungry cores. This architecture is near-universal in the ARM world—which now includes Apple M1 Macs as well as Android and iOS phones and tablets—but it's far less common in the x86_64 \"traditional computing\" world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788521#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788521&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"338bbb3f38e885ab518e8fd74a8870ce6e4eea426a7e843d3ccd46336a01286b","category":"Tech"}
