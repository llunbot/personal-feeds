As we speak the UK is transitioning back to something like a respectable country, ‘The clown show is over’ wrote <em>Der Spiegel</em>. England has done it! And not only that, it has continued its record of never missing a penalty under a Labour government in 2024. And then the Tour, and what a Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard has defied all odds and is giving Tadej Pogačar a run for his money, and this is Pog, a rider who apparently dropped 2.5kg and gained 10 watts since his Giro domination. The French have finally done some winning, which is also nice. And then, Cav. Or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mark-cavendish-35-tour-de-france\">‘the sprinting Methuselah’, as Ewan Wilson has called him</a>. (Currently the best nickname I’ve heard in 2024, chapeau Ewan.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we need now is for Pog’s tufty hair to lose him the last day time-trial like Fignon’s ponytail in 1989*, and this actually will be the Tour for the ages everyone hoped for, but which looked so unlikely in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Completely unconnected to any of this are my favourite pieces on cyclist.co.uk: <a href=\"http://*Apparently years later Fignon would occasionally stop, count out eight paces in seconds and sigh to himself… listen to that and more in our Greg LeMond Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode).\" target=\"_blank\">Ewan’s guide to pro cycling’s transfer market</a>, and because I love wacky bikes, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/look-classic-bikes\">Look’s classic bikes</a> gallery.

Material is thin but compressive and has performed wonderfully across a range of temperatures, from low teens to (whisper it) the other day when it went over 25°C. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, down in the engine room, Velobici calls it its ‘legendary seven-hour chamois pad’, but I just call it comfy and notably silky against my skin; then up top the strap arrangement – wide, flat, with a back panel to keep straps in position – sits smooth and flush against the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Velobici_Hammer_kit_2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The matching Hammer jersey is all embroidered logos and neat details, and like the shorts is on the lighter side. Even so, like a lot of Velobici kit the Hammer jersey leans towards opulence as opposed to skin-tight racy, but nonetheless this is the raciest jersey yet I’ve yet tried from the British brand. It’s light, form-fitting and quick drying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has Velobici’s signature revisionist pocket theory, which sees the Hammer jersey get four rear pockets, two small of back, two sort of side/kidney, then a fifth zip pocket atop the rear left-side pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/velobici-cyclewear-hammer-ao-sp-d9-copy-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest I’ve never had a problem with the standard three pockets, but hey, Velobici wants to be different and that’s OK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Styling is stand-out despite a muted colour palette (the Hammer also comes in the green/brown above), and it’s this that endears me to Velobici more than anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, my partner jibed that the kit is designed by Victoria Beckham, but in a sea of kit makers, Velobici’s gear looks different. Sort of cycling Mods go to Italy. I like it.

The front is 34.2mm wide while the rear slims to 30mm. Rim depth and internal width are the same front to back, the Sub50 rim being 49.5mm deep and 23mm wide internally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust Hunt, this configuration is more aero than before – the Sub50s are 1.4W more efficient than the 48 Limitless, and that’s with 30mm tyres (the 48 benchmark is with 28mm tyres). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On that note, the Sub50 is designed around 28mm-30mm tyres, compared to the 48s, which are optimised for 25mm-28mm. That tells you everything you need to know about where things have been heading in the last few years’ quest for rolling speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Hunt_Sub50_Limitless_-wheels_6-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Photo: Joseph Branston</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels shed around 130g, with a pair of Sub50s plus rim tape weighing just 1,383g on my scales.

Crucially, the new hubs feature simplified and more robust ratchet freehub internals, instead of a traditional pawl mechanism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many carbon-spoked wheels, Sub50 wheels can be trued or spokes replaced in the normal fashion, since the carbon spokes aren’t co-moulded to rims or hubs. Rather, they insert in the hub in a straight-pull fashion and secure with threaded nipples, which are exposed at the rim edge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the weight, Hunt says carbon spokes make the Sub50 6% more responsive (ie, stiffer) than steel-spoke equivalents. Are they any good?

You can even bend it in/out to change how tightly it clamps that bidon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But none of this matters, because the true meaning of bottle cages – like all expensive bike parts – is to look good, and I love these cages so much because they are metal but still look really cool on carbon bikes, which usually look cheap with metal cages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single Sicuro bottle cage weighs just 32g, or 3.2 blue tits, given that a single blue tit weighs 10g. Which is insane. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I need to review a blue tit, talk to its manufacturer to see how they achieve the weight and see how much of it has been made by lasers. Imagine how light one will be when tits go beakless next year (industry rumour, you heard it here first).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/collections/bottle-cages/products/silca-sicuro-titanium-bottle-cage\" target=\"_blank\">Saddleback (£75)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized S-Works Torch shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>‘Super comfortable and stylish!’</em> wrote Scott F. <em>‘How can a pair of shoes make such a difference?’</em> wrote Jovica. <em>‘Would buy again,’ </em>wrote Ricardo S. Alright Ricardo S., are you made of money? These are £350, mate! But I do agree with these customer reviews, Specialized’s flag-shoe is magnificent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This size 45 pair of S-Works Torch shoes weighs 524g, and they feel every bit as feathery on. The soles are carbon-mega-stiff; the perforated uppers breathable but not draughty; and the twin Boa dial closure is about as easy to use and functional as things come. But my favourite thing, as with many Specialized shoes before these, is the Torch’s fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/S-Works_Torch_shoes_2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized offers the Torch in sizes EU36-49, with half sizes from EU38-46, but the stand-out-from-the-crowd factor is they come in ‘regular’ and ‘wide’ fits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Primarily this means the toe-box is much wider on the wides, which is perfect for my gouty feet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I am 39 years old, I am quite fit, I have a decent, mostly veggie diet, and yet I get gout and it’s not fair.

But what I do know is this surely means cycling sunnies are at last cool off the bike, and that the next time you see MF Doom he’ll have ditched the mask in favour of some Oakley Katos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also kudos to that hand in the back smoking a real cigarette. If you’re going to smoke, do it properly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun fact: French goalkeeper Fabian Barthez and defender Laurent Blanc used to smoke fags at halftime when they both played for Manchester United.
