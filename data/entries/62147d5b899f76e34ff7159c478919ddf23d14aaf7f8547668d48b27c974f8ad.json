Apple has spent most of the last two decades resisting sticking model numbers on its Macs and only differentiating iPhones and some iPads. Try to figure out the Apple TV you own, and it’s a “3rd generation.” Want to know if you can upgrade a 2015 iMac? Well, is that a regular display, Retina 4K (21.5-inch) or 5K (27-inch) you bought in 2015 released in 2014, or the “Mid 2015,” or “Late 2015” version?</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mac-gems-mactracker-current-models.png?w=1200\" /><figcaption>A list of current models can help you figure out whether to wait for a new Mac (or other Apple hardware) or buy now.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mactracker provides all the details you need on every Mac, iPhone, and iPad model Apple has ever released. But it also runs down nearly everything else currently and recently sold, including the HomePod and HomePod mini, Watch, AirPods (various), Magic Keyboards, and quite a bit more. (No Beats, however!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its developer, Ian Page, has also collected quite a bit of historical data. If you’d like to remember the camera resolution of the QuickTake 150 (640×480 pixels) and that it was introduced in May 1995, there you go.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mac-gems-mactracker-quicktake-1.png?w=1200\" /><figcaption>Refresh your memory of Apple’s earliest camera or latest iMac.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I consult Mactracker to find details such as the number of free memory slots and the specific kind of memory required for Macs models that had the ability to upgrade memory, sometimes with a bit of effort. And if you can’t recall which equipment Apple currently sells and in which versions, the Current Models link in the sidebar can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After losing track of warranty expirations, I used Mactracker’s My Models tab to add entries for all the equipment we have among the four of us in my household, including serial numbers and warranty expirations. You can click options for In Warranty, Leaving Warranty, and Out of Warranty as a quick check.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mac-gems-mactracker-my-macs.png?w=1200\" /><figcaption>Assemble a list of your—or your family’s—hardware with serial numbers and warranty expiration dates. (Some information blurred for privacy.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The only missing feature I want? A way to display the warranty end date and to manage the new AppleCare option of eternal monthly and yearly extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mactracker <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mactracker/id311421597&amp;xcust=1-1-358054-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">also comes in an iOS version</a>.
