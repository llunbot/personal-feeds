Today, we share the bike fully built up for what has to be one of the top Readers’ Rides of 2025. Andrew, take it away!</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’ll start by saying this bike has quickly become one of my all-time favorites. It speaks to my BMX and MTB roots while seamlessly integrating into my current preference for practical, everyday riding. Over the years, I’ve slowly whittled down my collection of bikes and parts, allowing me to figure out my specific build preferences and focus on what I truly enjoy. While we could deep dive into bike talk ad nauseam, at the end of the day, they are just tools for gettin’ around. The key is to ride what you enjoy and keep on having fun. Right now, this bike is IT for me!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-05.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-05.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This frame was conceived by Patrick at Ultradynamico, aka Ultratradition, and crafted by Joel at Clockwork back in 2015. I might be a bit biased, but I think they nailed it! The only change I’d consider would be the internal cable routing, which is my only gripe. Here are some build notes: raw, fillet-brazed construction with no file finish, designed to accommodate 27.5 x 2.8” tires, plenty of mounting options through axles front and rear, rocker dropouts from Paragon Machine Works, a segmented fork, matching custom-built racks, and a silver-brazed stainless steel head tube badge to top it off.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I discovered this thing listed for sale on The Radavist’s Rad Bazaar, posted by Patrick’s friend Jared, who owned it before me. I slept on it for a day but knew I had to reach out! Opportunities to own such a unique, custom-built bike that perfectly aligns with one’s own riding style, height, and aesthetic don’t come around that often. I simply couldn’t resist! Once it arrived, I quickly assembled it and took a late-night spin around the neighborhood. It quickly exceeded my stupidly high expectations!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-09.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-09.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Usually, I can tell within a minute or two of hopping on a new bike what adjustments I need to make and whether it will work for me long term. I swapped out a few components to help make it my own, focusing mainly on contact points, and upgraded to the beautifully machined Hope hydraulic brakes. Of course, I also added some obligatory finishing touches like a brass <a href=\"https://www.yellowbirdthreadworks.com/nightcaps\">Nightcap</a> from Yellow Bird Thread Works and a brass <a href=\"https://foragercycles.com/products/cable-cherries\">Cable Cherry</a> from Forager Cycles. Those kinds of thoughtful little details just help make me smile. After all, smile gains are performance gains, ya know?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, the bike rides just as you would expect from looking at the pictures. It feels stable and predictable without sacrificing playfulness, whether out on the trail or on the street. It’s comfortable enough for all-day rides, with oh-so-smooth characteristics thanks to the high-volume tires and gracefully curved fork legs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/CLOCKWORK-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’m not really sure how to categorize it, but I like to think of it as a modern interpretation of a classic mountain tourer – much like those reliable rigid mountain bikes from the 1980s. Whether you’re loading it up for a cross-country expedition, planning an overnight camping trip with friends, running errands around town, or exploring a spooky, defunct military base, it won’t let you down!</p>\n<p><strong>Build Spec:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frame: Clockwork 27.5+</li>\n<li>Headset: Chris King w/ Nightcap</li>\n<li>Stem: Snap BMX 65mm</li>\n<li>Handlebar: Surly Sunrise cut to 29”</li>\n<li>Grips: Ergon GP1</li>\n<li>Brakes: Hope Tech Evo</li>\n<li>Shifter: Shimano XTR 11s</li>\n<li>Derailleur: Shimano XTR 11s</li>\n<li>Cassette: Shimano XT 11-42t</li>\n<li>Chain: Shimano 11s</li>\n<li>Chainring: Wolf Tooth 32t</li>\n<li>Crankset: White Industries by Sugino</li>\n<li>Pedals: MKS XC-111</li>\n<li>Saddle: Brooks B17 Titanium</li>\n<li>Seatpost: Moots Titanium</li>\n<li>Clamp: Wolf Tooth</li>\n<li>Hubs: White Industries XMR</li>\n<li>Rims: Light Bicycle Carbon 36h</li>\n<li>Tires: Teravail Honcho 2.6”</li>\n<li>Tubes: Yes!</li>\n<li>Racks &amp; Bags: Clockwork w/ Ron’s Bikes x Hope Fab’s Chest</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>You can find Andrew on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ifdogsrunfree/\" target=\"_blank\">@ifdogsrunfree</a> or out pedaling around his home on the SE corner of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
