AWS Nitro System SSDs are custom built by AWS and offer high I/O performance, low latency, minimal latency variability, and security with always-on encryption.</p> \n<p>EC2 I8g instances are the first instance type to use third-generation AWS Nitro SSDs. These instances offer up to 22.5 TB local NVME SSD storage with up to 65 percent better real-time storage performance per TB and 60 percent lower latency variability compared to the previous generation <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-storage-optimized-amazon-ec2-i4g-instances-graviton-processors-and-aws-nitro-ssds/\">I4g instances</a>. Based on the AWS Graviton4 processors, I8g instances deliver up to 60 percent better compute performance and two times larger caches compared to I4g.</p> \n<p>I8g instances offer up to 96 vCPUs, 768 GiB of memory, and 22.5 TB of storage to deliver more compute and storage choices compared with I4g instances.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (Gib)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Storage (GB)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>468</td> \n   <td>up to 10</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>937</td> \n   <td>up to 10</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>1,875</td> \n   <td>up to 12</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>3,750</td> \n   <td>up to 25</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>7,500<br /> (2 x 3,750)</td> \n   <td>up to 25</td> \n   <td>10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>11,520<br /> (3 x 3,750)</td> \n   <td>up to 28.125</td> \n   <td>15 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>512</td> \n   <td>15,000<br /> (4 x 3,750)</td> \n   <td>up to 37.5</td> \n   <td>20 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>768</td> \n   <td>22,500<br /> (6 x 3,750)</td> \n   <td>up to 56.25</td> \n   <td>20 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>I8g.metal-24×1</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>768</td> \n   <td>22,500<br /> (6 x 3,750)</td> \n   <td>up to 56.25</td> \n   <td>30 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>You can use I8g instances for I/O intensive workloads that require low latency access to data such as transactional databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL), real-time databases, NoSQL databases, (Aerospike, Apache Druid, MongoDB) and real-time analytics such as Apache Spark.</p> \n<p>Additionally, I8g instances are built on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a>, which offloads CPU virtualization, storage, and networking functions to dedicated hardware and software to enhance the performance and security of your workloads. The Graviton4 processors offer you enhanced security by fully encrypting all high-speed physical hardware interfaces.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Things to know</u></strong><br /> Here are some things that you should know about EC2 I8g instances:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Operating system</strong> – EC2 I8g instances support Amazon Linux 2023, Amazon Linux 2, CentOS Stream 8 or newer, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, SUSE 15 SP2 or newer, Debian 11 or newer, Red Hat Enterprise 8.2 or newer, CentOS 8.2 or newer, FreeBSD 13 or newer, Rocky Linux 8.4 or newer, Alma Linux 8.4 or newer, and Alpine Linux 3.12.7 or newer.</li> \n <li><strong>Networking</strong> – You can use I8g instances in storage intensive workloads that typically have burst network usage patterns. All I8g instance sizes have burst network bandwidth and can burst more than 60 minutes, depending on the instance sizes, to support the majority of the workloads requiring instance storage data hydration, backup, and snapshot over the network.</li> \n <li><strong>Migration</strong> – If you’re using I4g instances now, you will have straightforward experience migrating storage intensive workloads to I8g instances because these instances offer similar memory and storage ratios to existing I4g instances.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><u>Now available</u></strong><br /> Amazon EC2 I8g instances are now available in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region\">AWS Regions</a> through On-Demand instances, Savings Plans, Spot Instances, Dedicated Instances, or Dedicated Hosts.</p> \n<p>Give EC2 I8g instances a try in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon EC2 console</a>.
