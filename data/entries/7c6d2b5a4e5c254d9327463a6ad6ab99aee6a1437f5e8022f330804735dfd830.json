This was the only prudent choice that would have enabled Amazon to launch half of its constellation by a 2026 deadline, the lawsuit states.</p>\n\n<p>The plaintiffs say that the Falcon 9 costs less than its competitors and has other advantages, such as being available now. Nevertheless, the lawsuit alleges, SpaceX was never considered due to an intense and personal rivalry between that launch company's founder, Elon Musk, and Bezos, who has a competing rocket company in Blue Origin.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964988#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964988&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7c6d2b5a4e5c254d9327463a6ad6ab99aee6a1437f5e8022f330804735dfd830","category":"Tech"}
