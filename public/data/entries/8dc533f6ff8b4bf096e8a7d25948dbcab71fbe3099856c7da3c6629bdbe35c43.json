Mallet Trail\" title=\"Crankbrothers Mallet Trail\" />                                            <p>The Crankbrothers Mallet Trail is the latest addition to the brand’s pedal line-up, sitting between the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/crankbrothers-candy-1-review/\">Candy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/crankbrothers-mallet-e-pedals-review/\">Mallet E</a>.</p>\n<p>As the name would suggest, Crankbrothers’ new pedals are designed for trail riding, although the brand says elements of the pedal have been optimised for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>.</p>\n<p>The Mallet Trail will cost £179.99 / $179.99 / €179.99 and comes in ‘champagne’, purple and black colour options.</p>\n<p>The pedals are expected to be available at the end of March.</p>\n<h2>Wide stance</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Crankbrothers says the pedal has been designed around its match system.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Crankbrothers</i></span></div>\n<p>Crankbrothers says the size and platform of the pedal have been optimised for gravel and trail riding.</p>\n<p>A long spindle is used to increase <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stance-width-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/\">stance width</a>, resulting in a 57mm Q-factor compared to the 52mm found on the Candy.</p>\n<p>Crankbrothers says this increases speed and stability, while adding more shoe clearance around the chainstays.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Mallet Trail has been designed with gravel riding in mind.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Crankbrothers</i></span></div>\n<p>Both sides of the pedal feature adjustable pins, allowing for a grippier contact patch between the pedal and shoe.</p>\n<p>The pedal also features Crankbrothers’ signature eggbeater clipless system – aptly named due to its whisk-like appearance.</p>\n<p>The eggbeater clip enables four-sided entry and a customisable float adjust.</p>\n<p>Crankbrothers claims its system offers superior mud-shedding capabilities because the eggbeater can spin within the pedal cage, unlike other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-pedals/\">mountain bike pedals</a> that feature a fixed pedal body.</p>\n<h2>Adjustable traction pads</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Mallet Trail features an aluminium construction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Crankbrothers</i></span></div>\n<p>Similar to other pedals in Crankbrothers’ line-up, traction pads feature on either side of the eggbeater for added purchase on the pedal interface.</p>\n<p>A thicker set is supplied, enabling you to tailor the pedals depending on the cleat-box depth of your shoes.</p>\n<p>An aluminium hex-key end cap positioned on the outside of the pedal is said to improve durability, while maintaining easy access to the pedal internals for servicing.</p>\n<p>The brand says the Mallet E features premium bearings, and utilises a double seal system to keep the internals free from water and grit.</p>","author":"Nick
