Read on below and check out our video above for details of these stories and more!\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Hands-On With Apple's MagSafe Battery Pack</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-launches-99-magsafe-battery-pack/\">released a new MagSafe Battery Pack</a> that magnetically attaches to the back of the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max, providing additional hours of battery life on the go. In one of our latest YouTube videos, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/magsafe-battery-pack-hands-on/\">we went hands on with the MagSafe Battery Pack to see if it's worth its $99 price tag</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-mini.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe MagSafe Battery Pack can be ordered from Apple's online store and is currently estimated for late July delivery, and it is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/magsafe-battery-pack-available-for-in-store-pickup/\">also available for same-day Apple Store pickup</a> at select locations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Redesigned MacBook Pros Expected to Launch Between September and November</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWe've been hearing for a while now that Apple is working on redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the M1 chip, and this week it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/18/redesigned-macbook-pros-fall-launch/\">the notebooks will be released at some point between September and November</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-render.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple apparently planned to launch the new MacBook Pro models earlier this year, but continued complications with mini-LED display production delayed their launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iPhone 13 May Feature Apple Watch-Like Always-On Display</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/18/iphone-13-always-on-display/\">iPhone 13 models will potentially have an Apple Watch-like always-on display mode</a> where the clock and other status indicators are persistently visible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iPhone-13-Always-On-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAn always-on display would be the result of iPhone 13 models adopting low-power LTPO display technology, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/iphone-13-pro-120hz-displays-samsung/\">higher 120Hz refresh rate is also expected on the Pro models</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iPad Mini 6 Rumored to Feature A15 Chip, Smart Connector, and More</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMore details emerged about what we can expect from the next iPad mini this week, including that it will apparently be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ipad-mini-6-a15-chip-and-smart-connector/\">powered by the same A15 chip as expected for the iPhone 13</a>. The device may also gain a Smart Connector for connecting compatible keyboards.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iPad-mini-pro-feature-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile one recent rumor claimed that the next iPad mini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/ipad-mini-with-mini-led-display-rumor/\">will be equipped with a mini-LED display</a> like on the iPad Pro for higher brightness and improved contrast, display analyst Ross Young <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/ipad-mini-mini-led-display-analyst/\">says this will not be the case</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>2022 iPhone SE Said to Feature A15 Chip, 5G, and 4.7-Inch Display</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nRumors are ramping up about the next iPhone SE, which is rumored to look similar to the current model but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/2022-iphone-se-a15-chip-5g/\">feature some notable improvements, including a faster A15 chip and 5G support</a>. The device is expected to launch during the first half of 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/iphone-se-2020-red.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe iPhone SE is the cheapest iPhone that Apple sells, starting at $399 with 64GB of storage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods 3 Mass Production Said to Kick Off in August</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIf the latest supply chain indications are accurate, new AirPods could finally be on the horizon, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/airpods-3-mass-production-august/\">mass production of the wireless earphones reportedly set to begin in August</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/airpods-3-with-iphone-13-event/\">launch potentially coming alongside the iPhone 13 lineup in September</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-gizmochina-Feature-teal.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third-generation ‌AirPods‌ are rumored to adopt a similar design to the current AirPods Pro, with shorter stems and silicone ear tips. However, they would likely <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">lack some of the more advanced AirPods Pro features</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jul-22-2021\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/24/top-stories-iphone-13-always-on/\">Top Stories: Hands-On With MagSafe Battery Pack, iPhone 13 Always-On Display?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-hands-on-with-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-13-always-on-display.2305321/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YJCncfd-41k:VJVhNIbmA88:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YJCncfd-41k:VJVhNIbmA88:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YJCncfd-41k\" />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2a1161891a3c8930f38933f74b1505611d7344a1d10af64e335e228018ce428e","category":"Apple"}
