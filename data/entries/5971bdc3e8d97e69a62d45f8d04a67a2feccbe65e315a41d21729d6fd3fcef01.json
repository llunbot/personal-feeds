That is up to double the speeds that OWC's previous high-end external SSDs with Thunderbolt 3/Thunderbolt 4 support can achieve. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe external SSD has a built-in Thunderbolt 5 cable, and it is powered by the Mac that it is connected to, rather than an external power supply.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, these impressive speeds come at a steeper price compared to the average external SSD. OWC is now <a href=\"https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-envoy-ultra\">accepting pre-orders</a> for the Envoy Ultra through its online store in the U.S., with 2TB and 4TB storage capacities available for $399.99 and $599.99, respectively. Orders are estimated to begin shipping in early November.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOWC plans to announce a Thunderbolt 5 dock with an array of ports later in November.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's new Macs launch on Friday.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/owc/\">OWC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt-5/\">Thunderbolt 5</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/owc-thunderbolt-5-external-ssd-for-macs/\">OWC's Thunderbolt 5 External SSD for Latest Macs is Impressively Fast</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/owcs-thunderbolt-5-external-ssd-for-latest-macs-is-impressively-fast.2442093/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5971bdc3e8d97e69a62d45f8d04a67a2feccbe65e315a41d21729d6fd3fcef01","category":"Apple"}
