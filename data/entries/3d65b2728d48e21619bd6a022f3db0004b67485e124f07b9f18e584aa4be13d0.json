Awareness of issues around concussion is on the rise, and there’s been significant change in recent years.</p>\n<p>The UCI introduced the first <a href=\"https://archive.uci.org/docs/default-source/medical/2020-uci-cycling-specific-sport-related-concussion-protocol.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">concussion protocol</a> for cycling in 2020.</p>\n<p>Here, we look at what you need to know about <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/injuries/head-and-neck-injuries/concussion\" target=\"_blank\">concussion</a>, what to do in the event of a head injury and the bigger picture in cycling.</p>\n<h2>What is concussion?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Illustration showing the mechanics of concussion in human brain\" title=\"Illustration showing the mechanics of concussion in human brain\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Concussion is caused when the brain collides with the skull, or when it rotates or stretches.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Concussion_mechanics.svg\"><strong>Patrick J. Lynch / Creative Commons</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>We spoke to <a href=\"https://www.headway.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Headway</a>, a UK-based brain injury charity, which aims to raise awareness of, and provide education around, head injuries. We asked them to define exactly what is meant by concussion.</p>\n<p>Luke Griggs, deputy chief executive of Headway, explains that “a concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury, or TBI, caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or by a hit to the body.</p>\n<p>“The effect of the brain moving rapidly within the skull can cause damage to brain cells or tissue.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, concussion is a change in how the brain functions, which happens because the brain is made up of delicate tissue – less resistant to physical forces than much of our bodies.</p>\n<p>The brain sits suspended in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which acts as a shock absorber. However, given enough force, it can collide with the skull, or rotate and stretch – causing it damage.</p>\n<h2>Myth-busting the common misconceptions</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CANNOCK, ENGLAND - AUGUST 03: Emily Bridson of Team Jersey crashes during the Women's Cross-country Final on day six of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games at Cannock Chase Forest on August 03, 2022 in Cannock, England.

Races continue while riders are assessed, with no option for time out or substitution – and every second stopped for injury assessment is one the rider will need to claw back.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DIEST, BELGIUM - JUNE 10: Elizabeth Banks of The United Kingdom and Team EF Education-TIBCO-SVB competes during the 3rd Duracell Dwars Door Het Hageland 2023, Women's Elite a 128km one day race from Aarschot to Diest on June 10, 2023 in Diest, Belgium.
