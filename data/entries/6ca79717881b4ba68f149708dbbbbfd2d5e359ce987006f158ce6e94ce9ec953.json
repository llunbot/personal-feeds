Basically, if you try to send someone an audio message in the Messages app that includes the phrase \"Dave and Buster's,\" it won't go through.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter you send the message, it'll show on your own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and the person on the other end will see three dots as if you're typing something. The message ultimately just disappears after a few seconds, never showing up for the person that you're speaking to. It was Dave &amp; Buster's that led to the bug being discovered, but it in fact impacts any company with an ampersand in the name.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs it turns out, the problem isn't with the audio message itself, but with the transcript that accompanies any audio message that you send. Apple's transcription engine understands proper company names like H&amp;M or Dave &amp; Buster's, displaying them with an ampersand rather than the word \"and,\" so when you send someone a voice message saying something like \"Do you want to go to Dave &amp; Buster's?\" the transcript is rendered just like that, with the proper name.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's the ampersand symbol that's causing an issue, because Apple's transcription engine isn't rendering the ampersand XHTML correctly, causing a parsing error on the device of the person receiving the message. The parsing error triggers Apple's BlastDoor Messages feature that protects users from malicious messages that might rely on problematic parsing, so ultimately, the audio message fails to send.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRambo goes <a href=\"https://rambo.codes/posts/2025-05-12-cracking-the-dave-and-busters-anomaly\">into more detail</a> about the root of the issue, and the original <a href=\"https://www.searchengine.show\">Search Engine podcast</a> also has more on the bug, so check those out if you want to hear more about Apple's minor error that's nixing any audio message with an ampersand.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-ampersand-messages-bug/\">Apple Bug Prevents You From Telling People About Dave &amp; Buster's</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-bug-prevents-you-from-telling-people-about-dave-busters.2456963/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ca79717881b4ba68f149708dbbbbfd2d5e359ce987006f158ce6e94ce9ec953","category":"Apple"}
