ChronoSync for macOS, from Econ Technologies, can give those who want it tighter control over their backup options, and while you may not have heard of it, it’s garnered a fan base over the years that’s arguably justified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where price and offerings are concerned, ChronoSync offers something valid for your money. A single license currently retails for $49.99 as of this writing, there is also a ‘cut-down’entry-level’ <a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/product/chronosync-express/\">ChronoSync Express</a> package for $29.99, with that app also being part of the <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">SetApp bundle</a>. The company also offers a 15-day trial without requiring a credit or debit card as well as a lifetime of support in terms of free updates after one-and-done payments without bothering you to set up an ongoing subscription. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>See how Chronosync compares to other <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668696/best-mac-backup-software.html\">Mac Backup apps</a> we’ve tested.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The software requires macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later to install and run, and during testing, downloaded and installed cleanly, the software’s installation engine requesting full access to the hard drive in the Security and Privacy settings and assigning this without any fuss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChronoSync presents a world of backup options to you, in a format that doesn’t overwhelm. The software is based on several core modules such as Home Folder Backup, Data Volume, Synchronize Two Folders, Multiple Folder Backup, Bootable Backup, Backup to a Disk Image, and Folder Backup. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync2-The-ChronoSync-Organizer-which-serves-as-the-programs-home-screen-and-offers-easy-access-to-modules.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"ChronoSync Organizer\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync2-The-ChronoSync-Organizer-which-serves-as-the-programs-home-screen-and-offers-easy-access-to-modules.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 836w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync2-The-ChronoSync-Organizer-which-serves-as-the-programs-home-screen-and-offers-easy-access-to-modules.jpeg?resize=300%2C208&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync2-The-ChronoSync-Organizer-which-serves-as-the-programs-home-screen-and-offers-easy-access-to-modules.jpeg?resize=768%2C534&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"836\" height=\"581\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The ChronoSync Organizer, which serves as the program’s home screen and offers easy access to modules.</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply select your desired function from the ChronoSync Organizer/home screen, and you can begin creating or editing a task that can be saved and worked with later. Select the task you want to create, specify your settings (such as folders you want to copy over, file types you want to copy, a schedule you want for backups to take place, etc.), hit “Synchronize” and you’re off to the races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Test synchronizations can also be set up to simulate functions, and a readily-accessible manual offers quick access to a guidebook that comes in handy. For the truly die-hard and geeky, rule-based copies and tasks can be set up, while the Analyze feature offers extensive information about documents such as a file types and permission settings. The task container option can be used for easy scripting, and you can quickly set up multiple steps for ChronoSync to follow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features include being able to readily back up to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668856/best-nas-pcs-drives-for-mac.html\">NAS</a> and file servers, the program supporting Apple’s HFS+ and APFS file formats as well as allowing for easy archiving tools and AES-128 and AES-256 encryption tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users looking to make bootable clones, this is as easy as it should be, ChronoSync’s module allowing for something just as easy as what <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2371118/superduper-review.html\">SuperDuper! </a>or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405539/carbon-copy-cloner-review.html\">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> have become known for, and it was simple to choose a source volume, choose a target volume, hit “Synchronize,” let the process run, and have a volume that was a cinch to boot from at the end of the process.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync6-Configuring-a-test-backup-in-ChronoSync.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Configuring a test backup in ChronoSync\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync6-Configuring-a-test-backup-in-ChronoSync.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2161w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync6-Configuring-a-test-backup-in-ChronoSync.jpeg?resize=300%2C230&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync6-Configuring-a-test-backup-in-ChronoSync.jpeg?resize=768%2C588&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync6-Configuring-a-test-backup-in-ChronoSync.jpeg?resize=1200%2C919&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync6-Configuring-a-test-backup-in-ChronoSync.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1176&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChronoSync6-Configuring-a-test-backup-in-ChronoSync.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1568&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"919\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Configuring a test backup in ChronoSync.</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>ChronoSync has a few areas for improvement, but they’re essentially cosmetic. A lack of a quick button that can be clicked to go back to the ChronoSync Organizer/home screen is a bit odd, as you just close the window to navigate back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application’s built-in manual is good, and there’s easy access to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/support/support-form.html\">ticketing system</a> should you require tech support, but the company’s YouTube tutorial videos are now six years old and there’s apparently been no effort to update these videos. I feel as if this is a missed opportunity, as users tend to love these, they’re easy to refer to, and would allow an easier learning curve if people are a bit overwhelmed by the number of customization and options available within ChronoSync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the synchronization function displays the elapsed time and a progress bar, but no estimated time until completion, which could come in handy as a user interface element.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy ChronoSync? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, these are small things, the application is responsive, ran well in both the foreground and the background, and while it’d be amazing to see this grow into a program that could readily back up to cloud-based services such as Apple’s iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, or Dropbox, there’s something excellent here for both the home user and the more tech-focused user who wants more customization than Time Machine offers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, a few user interface elements could be improved upon and I think Econ Technologies could go the whole hog with a set of both funny and useful YouTube tutorial videos, but I think ChronoSync has found a good place in terms of its pricing, support, offering a countdown as to days remaining on the free trial, and not bombarding its users with marketing or ads to purchase a license for the full version of the software. If anything, this offers a bridge for the casual Mac user to create custom, scheduled backups and have complete control over their backups, making the process that much more satisfying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChronoSync may not have the name recognition of Apple’s Time Machine or some of its competitors, but what’s present here is excellent, and offers the potential for additional backup control for more casual Mac users, or the ability to utilize an amazing amount of customization and go entirely bananas for geekier Macheads. There’s a 15-day free trial, and if you haven’t given ChronoSync a gander, this is worth your attention.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"32a3cf93447afe5d586e065a8041eb0b888674f45831b7aa0b9ced7553a3426c","category":"Apple"}
