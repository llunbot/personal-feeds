Let's talk about spaceplanes. Since the Space Shuttle, spaceplanes have, at best, been a niche part of the space transportation business. The US Air Force's uncrewed X-37B and a similar vehicle operated by China's military are the only spaceplanes to reach orbit since the last shuttle flight in 2011, and both require a lift from a conventional rocket. Virgin Galactic's suborbital space tourism platform is also a spaceplane of sorts. A generation or two ago, one of the chief arguments in favor of spaceplanes was that they were easier to recover and reuse. Today, SpaceX routinely reuses capsules and rockets that look much more like conventional space vehicles than the winged designs of yesteryear. Spaceplanes are undeniably alluring in appearance, but they have the drawback of carrying extra weight (wings) into space that won't be used until the final minutes of a mission. So, do they have a future?</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.

The Kinetica-1 is one of several small Chinese solid-fueled launch vehicles managed by a commercial company, although with strict government oversight and support. CAS Space, a spinoff of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said its Kinetica-1 rocket deployed multiple payloads with \"excellent orbit insertion accuracy.\" This was the seventh flight of a Kinetica-1 rocket since its debut in 2022.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-spacexs-expansion-at-vandenberg-indias-pslv-fails-in-flight/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-spacexs-expansion-at-vandenberg-indias-pslv-fails-in-flight/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e2e89e46d4899a6ebb245b1bacbd9cc00a62ef5f4b38dbee940ca87825220799","category":"Tech"}
