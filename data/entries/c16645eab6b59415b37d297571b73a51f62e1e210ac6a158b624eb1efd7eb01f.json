Non-Odyssey owners won't be able to purchase the Python Mk II with regular credits until three months later, on August 7. At that point, the ship will also be available as an ARX-denominated \"pre-built ship package\" that \"allow[s] you to kickstart your career in the latest ship, including a brand-new paintjob and ship kit.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019650#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019650&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c16645eab6b59415b37d297571b73a51f62e1e210ac6a158b624eb1efd7eb01f","category":"Tech"}
