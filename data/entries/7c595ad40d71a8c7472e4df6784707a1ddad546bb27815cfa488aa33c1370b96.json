There are no more events or updates, with the Pocket Camp service set to be discontinued on November 29, but the paid offline version will allow saves to be transferred over.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new paid version includes all the content added since the free online version of <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> was released in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/21/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-launches/\">2017</a>. The gameplay is virtually identical the previous version, but without in-app purchases or the ability to interact with other human players. Existing users can transfer their saved data from the previous version to the offline variant until June 2, 2025. Transferring a Pocket Camp save to the new app requires linking to a Nintendo Account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe offline version will include new content, including the ability to create a Camper Card for players to introduce themselves to other players. The cards can be scanned for collecting and exchanging. There is also a new location to visit, called Whistle Pass, where players whose cards have been scanned come to visit. Nintendo says this is an alternative to the existing online mode, where players visit each other's camping spot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> can now be <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967\">pre-ordered in the App Store</a> and is a one-time $9.99 purchase until January 31, 2025, when the price will go up to $19.99. The game will be playable from December 3, 2024, while the online servers of the existing free game will close on November 29.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nintendo/\">Nintendo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-offline-dec-3/\">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete Gets December 3 Release Date</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-gets-december-3-release-date.2441115/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7c595ad40d71a8c7472e4df6784707a1ddad546bb27815cfa488aa33c1370b96","category":"Apple"}
