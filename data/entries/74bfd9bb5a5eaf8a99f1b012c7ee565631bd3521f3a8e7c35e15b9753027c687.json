The legislation introduces new rules that apply to tech giants that meet its \"gatekeeper\" criteria and force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. For example, Apple could be forced to allow third-party companies and rival apps like Meta's WhatsApp to integrate directly with iMessage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn recent correspondence with the European Commission, Apple argued that iMessage does not meet the number of users at which the DMA's rules apply, and should not be obliged to comply with it as a result. Analysts estimate that iMessage has as many as one billion users around the world, but Apple has not disclosed any official numbers about the service for several years, or how many users it has in Europe specifically. Whether iMessage will be included on the EU's initial list of gatekeeper services will depend on how it defines the market in which it operates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe DMA could prompt similar major changes to the way in which the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> work over the next couple of years.
