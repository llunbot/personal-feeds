The sales reps from other bike companies noticed the racks and started purchasing them for their other retail clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1980 Henry closed the bike shop and started manufacturing the racks in Downtown Los Angeles. Henry’s son Neil, was a former mechanical engineer in aerospace, when he joined the company in 1986. Neil still holds the “head engineer and product designer” spot today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neil is responsible for growing the brand. He did so by introducing some of the first hitch racks to the market as well as distributing products internationally. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hollywood Racks Today and Beyond</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hollywood-Racks-50-years-new-ebike-rack-with-lights.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hollywood-Racks-50-years-new-ebike-rack-with-lights-800x400.jpeg\" alt=\"Hollywood Racks 50 years new ebike rack with lights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hollywood-Racks-50-years-new-ebike-rack-with-lights-800x400.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hollywood-Racks-50-years-new-ebike-rack-with-lights-297x149.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hollywood-Racks-50-years-new-ebike-rack-with-lights-120x60.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hollywood-Racks-50-years-new-ebike-rack-with-lights-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hollywood-Racks-50-years-new-ebike-rack-with-lights.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2014 saw Neil’s son, Evan join the team.
