For those who crave a bit of humor with their blood-soaked scares, I've compiled a list of some of my favorite horror comedies for your viewing pleasure.</p>\n<p>What constitutes a horror comedy? Is it merging classic creature features with goofy slapstick humor? Is it primarily super scary with a few notes of humor? Is the humor sharply satirical or primarily delivered by wisecracking characters? Is it parody? Or does good horror comedy go full meta, poking fun at the tropes while sneaking in incisive cultural commentary?</p>\n<p>Horror comedy is all of those things and more, which is why picking films to include on this list proved so tricky. For instance, <em>The Mummy</em> (1999) features a classic monster but it fits just as well in the action/comedy category, while <em>Ghostbuster</em>s (1984) is pretty much straight-up comedy. Yet I could have included both on this list without too many complaints. In the end, I cut the list down to 20, opting for a sampler that features blockbusters, vintage films, cult classics, and contemporary offerings, each with its own unique mix of horror and comedic elements.
