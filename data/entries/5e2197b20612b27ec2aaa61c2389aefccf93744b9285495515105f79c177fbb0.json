ChatGPT can now read code from these environments and make edits directly within them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn optional \"auto-apply\" mode enables ChatGPT to implement changes without additional clicks. Alexander Embiricos, a member of OpenAI's product team, <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1897700857833193955\">shared a demonstration of the feature</a> on social media and noted that the capability will come to Windows \"soon.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe direct code editing functionality is currently available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers who update their macOS app. OpenAI plans to roll out the feature to Enterprise, Education, and free users next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis update builds on ChatGPT's \"work with apps\" capability launched in beta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/openai-chatgpt-xcode-for-mac/\">last November</a>, which allowed the AI to read code from development environments but not directly modify it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>ChatGPT for macOS can now edit code directly in IDEs.
