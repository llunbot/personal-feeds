The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation has <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2023/INOA-PE23014-4415.PDF\">opened a preliminary evaluation</a> to determine if there's a problem with the power steering in model-year 2023 Tesla Models 3 and Y.</p>\n<p>The investigation, sparked by a dozen customer complaints, is one of a number of open safety investigations into Tesla's EVs. Just this year NHTSA's ODI also opened probes into complaints of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/feds-open-yet-another-safety-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot/\">sudden unintended acceleration</a>, and another is looking at <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/tesla-under-new-federal-investigation-for-steering-wheels-that-detach/\">the propensity for steering wheels to detach</a>.</p>\n<p>In this case, NHTSA received 12 complaints alleging steering failure in three Model 3s and nine Model Ys. Some complaints describe the steering suddenly and randomly locking in place; others relate power steering failures that required heavy effort to remain in control of the car.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958188#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958188&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
