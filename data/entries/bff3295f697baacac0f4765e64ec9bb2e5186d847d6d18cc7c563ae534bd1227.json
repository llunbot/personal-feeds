Together, Hutchinson says that the tyre’s new design features result in a ten percent reduction in rolling resistance, while a 15 percent wider tread adds extra grip and cornering traction and is designed to work better with modern wide wheel rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hutchinson Blackbird tyre is made in France and available in 26mm, 28mm and 30mm widths, priced at £61.99 for the tubeless and £43.99 for the tubetype tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lower rolling resistance and 4,000km lifespan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"830\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-970x830.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Blackbird tyre\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-970x830.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-300x257.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-768x657.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-1536x1314.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-2048x1752.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-750x642.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Blackbird_TLR_3D_techno-3-1140x975.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Blackbird tyre is the result of four years of R&amp;D in Hutchinson’s labs in Montargis south of Paris.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hutchinson points out that the difference between staying rubber side down and a less pleasant outcome boils down to three square centimetres of contact surface. The Blackbird tyre’s new casing and wider tread rubber have been designed so that the tyre forms a contact patch with the road surface that’s wider than it is long, which Hutchinson says increases cornering grip and contributes to lowered rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">Hooked vs hookless rims: Pros, cons and which is right for you</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/gallery_adv/are-wider-tyres-faster\">Are wider tyres faster?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\">How to fit tubeless tyres: Pro tips for fitting tubeless road, gravel and MTB tyres</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\">Best road bike tyres 2024: 10 of the best tyres for all occasions</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The brand claims that the new rubber compound of the Blackbird tyre results in a 10 percent reduction in rolling resistance relative to its previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hutchinson-fusion-5-performance-11storm-tubeless-tyres-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fusion 5 tyre</a>.

It bonds the tyre casing directly to the central polyamide puncture protection strip, rather than the two layers overlapping, as is normal practice. There’s then a further layer of casing stretching from bead to bead to increase the tyre’s airtightness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hutchinson says that the result is a more flexible tyre, with two layers, plus the puncture protection belt, under the tread and three layers in the sidewalls. This, Hutchinson says, reduces rolling resistance and adds extra comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only having two layers to the casing also results in a lower weight, with Hutchinson claiming 290g for the 28mm width. The tyre shape has been engineered so that it’s less bulbous and more U-shaped, improving compatibility with wider, aero rims. It’s a similar approach to that used by Giant in its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cadex-50-ultra-disc-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">Cadex 50 Ultra Disc</a> wheel/tyre system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Mach Tread 3.0 rubber compound formulation is also claimed to make the Blackbird tyre faster. Hutchinson says that its high rebound and low rolling resistance result in a 25 percent increase in energy return from its contact with the road. It’s also claimed to be 10 percent harder than the 11Storm rubber compound used in the Fusion 5 tyre, and 75 percent more resistant to tearing, adding to the tyre’s cut resistance and longevity, without compromising grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve got a set of the new Hutchinson Blackbird tyres in for testing here at <em>Cyclist</em>, so look out for our review that’s in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Widths available, weights and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Blackbird tyre\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Hutchinson_Blackbird_Product_Clean-10-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At launch, the Hutchinson Blackbird tyre will be available in tubeless format in 26mm, 28mm and 30mm widths. Hutchinson claims weights of 275g, 290g and 310g respectively. If you’re running wheels with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\" target=\"_blank\">hookless beads</a>, the 28mm and 30mm widths are hookless compatible. There are both black and tan sidewall options for the 26mm and 28mm tyres, while the 30mm is black only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are sticking with inner tubes, there’s also a Tubetype option. This doesn’t have the SwiftEasy casing, but offers the same widths and black or tan sidewalls and uses a three layer 127tpi casing. Claimed weights are 225g for the 26mm, 245g for the 28mm and 265g for the 30mm width. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Price for the tubeless tyres in all widths is £61.99 / €69.99, while Tubetype tyres are priced at £43.99 / €49.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">best tubeless road tyres</a> for more summer tyre options.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hutchinson-blackbird-tyre\">Hutchinson’s new Blackbird tyre is fastest and most durable race tyre to date</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bff3295f697baacac0f4765e64ec9bb2e5186d847d6d18cc7c563ae534bd1227","category":"Cycling"}
