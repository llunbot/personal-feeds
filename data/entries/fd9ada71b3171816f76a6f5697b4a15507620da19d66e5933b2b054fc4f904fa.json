Over the next few months, the satellite will try to move within arm's reach of the rocket, taking pictures and performing complicated maneuvers to move around the bus-size H-IIA upper stage as it moves around the planet at nearly 5 miles per second (7.6 km/s).</p>\n<p>These maneuvers are complex, but they're nothing new for spacecraft visiting the International Space Station. Military satellites from the United States, Russia, and China also have capabilities for rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO), but as far as we know, these spacecraft have only maneuvered in ultra-close range around so-called \"cooperative\" objects designed to receive them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004454#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004454&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd9ada71b3171816f76a6f5697b4a15507620da19d66e5933b2b054fc4f904fa","category":"Tech"}
