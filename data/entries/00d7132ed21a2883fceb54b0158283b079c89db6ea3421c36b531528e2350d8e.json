Still, as the Classics elder statesman, Sagan doggedly lined up with mechanical shifting once again for this year’s Hell of the North – a lovably esoteric choice in a world almost totally dominated by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a>.</p>\n<p>Mechanical groupsets are almost never seen at the WorldTour level, with all teams running electronic groupsets for day-to-day racing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 54/46 is a big gear, but relatively common at Paris-Roubaix.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Sagan opted for an 11-speed Shimano Dura-Ace R91000 groupset.</p>\n<p>The 54/46t crankset provides a big gear, but is suitable for the relatively flat <em>parcours</em> of the Hell of the North.

Or is it a one-off for pro use only?</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Future Shock adjuster is also a different shape compared to the stock option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Future Shock adjuster – which controls the lockout of the system – is also different.</p>\n<p>The stock adjuster is circular and coated with rubber, with small indentations around the outside edge.</p>\n<p>The adjuster on Sagan’s bike has wings moulded into it, and a small lip that extends back towards the top tube.
