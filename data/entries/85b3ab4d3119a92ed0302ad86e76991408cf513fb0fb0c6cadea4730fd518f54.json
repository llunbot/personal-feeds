{"title":"Three Upcoming Apple Products Seemingly Spotted in macOS 26.3 Code","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/macos-26-3-code-three-new-apple-products/","date":1771601780000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-3/\">macOS 26.3</a> hints at Apple's rumored lower-cost MacBook, and two new Studio Display models, according to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3066403/macos-26-3-might-have-just-confirmed-apples-biggest-march-4-surprises.html\"><em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEspósito found the following codenames within macOS 26.3's source code, and he revealed the upcoming products that they likely correspond with, based on previous reporting from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe codenames:<ul><li><strong>J700:</strong> Lower-cost MacBook</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>J427:</strong> A new Studio Display</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>J527:</strong> A new, higher-end Studio Display</li></ul>This is far from the first time that these codenames have been spotted in Apple's software updates. According to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris, the codenames were also present in updates such as macOS 26.2 and iOS 18.5 last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-event-invite-hint-new-macbook-colors/\">more</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/\">more hints</a> stack up, it is clear that all three products are inching closer to release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe prevailing assumption is that Apple will unveil the lower-cost MacBook as part of three days of new product announcements <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/\">in the first week of March</a>. The media would then receive hands-on time with the laptop <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">during the \"Apple Experience\"</a> in New York, London, and Shanghai on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Studio Displays are expected to be released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/\">in the first half of 2026</a>, but it is unclear if they will be part of the announcements in the first week of March.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/mac-studio-and-studio-display.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"893\" />\r<br />\nThe lower-cost MacBook is rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/\">powered by a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip</a>, rather than an M-series chip. The laptop will apparently be available in a variety of bright colors, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">yellow, green, blue, and/or pink</a>. Other rumored specs include a 12.9-inch display and 8GB of RAM. The starting price remains to be seen, with estimates ranging from $599 to $799 in the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lower-cost MacBook would be an all-new model positioned below the MacBook Air, and it would mark a revival of the \"MacBook\" brand (with no \"Air\" or \"Pro\" designation). Apple sold an Intel-based 12-inch \"MacBook\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook/\">from 2015 to 2019</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt least one of the new Studio Display models is rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">up to a 90Hz</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">120Hz refresh rate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">HDR support</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">A19 chip</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 Pro chip</a>. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/apple-studio-display-2-latest-rumors/\">No major design changes</a> are expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the next Studio Display receives mini-LED backlighting and HDR support, its maximum brightness and contrast ratio would be higher than the current model. And a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip — up from the A13 Bionic currently — should contribute to performance improvements, camera-related enhancements, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are no details about the second Studio Display. Presumably, it would be a higher-end model, and we can only dream of a larger 32-inch screen size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current Studio Display launched in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio. It has a 27-inch screen without mini-LED backlighting, a 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., pricing starts at $1,599.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-a18-pro/\">MacBook (A18 Pro)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macworld-com/\">Macworld</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/macos-26-3-code-three-new-apple-products/\">Three Upcoming Apple Products Seemingly Spotted in macOS 26.3 Code</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/three-upcoming-apple-products-seemingly-spotted-in-macos-26-3-code.2477985/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"85b3ab4d3119a92ed0302ad86e76991408cf513fb0fb0c6cadea4730fd518f54","category":"Apple"}
