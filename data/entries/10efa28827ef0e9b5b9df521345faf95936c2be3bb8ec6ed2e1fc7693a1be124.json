Cars like the rally-bred WRXes and STIs did a lot of work here, but lately, Subaru has seemed to go in the opposite direction, phasing out fun drives like the STI lineup in favor of volume-movers like the Ascent and bloated versions of existing models such as the Subaru Wilderness editions.</p>\n<p>Its first electric vehicle is perhaps even less in character. The $44,995 Solterra is the result of an ongoing partnership with Toyota and was developed together with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/the-2023-toyota-bz4x-review-not-as-bad-as-the-horror-stories-have-it/\">the bZ4X</a>. Unlike the Toyota, there's no single-motor option for the Solterra. It's all-wheel-drive only, with a pair of identical 107 hp (80 kW) permanent magnet electric motors, one for each axle. That means you can do some, but not all, of the off-road things you'd expect to do with a Subaru.</p>\n<h2>Looks are deceiving</h2>\n<p>At first glance, the Solterra looks like the edgy, tech-leaning offspring of a Crosstrek and an Impreza wagon. The 8.3 inches of ground clearance is slightly less than the Outback or Forester, while the Solterra comes in at 184.6 inches (4,689 mm) in length, placing it squarely in the middle of the brand's stable. It's a rather compact SUV, even more so when you try to get comfortable in the cockpit. My short frame was cramped, and anyone taller than me won't feel welcome on long drives.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028799#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028799&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10efa28827ef0e9b5b9df521345faf95936c2be3bb8ec6ed2e1fc7693a1be124","category":"Tech"}
