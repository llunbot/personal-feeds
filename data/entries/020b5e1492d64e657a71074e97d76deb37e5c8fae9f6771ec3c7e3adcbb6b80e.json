{"title":"Apple Announces New iPad Mini, With A17 Pro and Pencil Pro Support","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-powerful-new-ipad-mini-built-for-apple-intelligence/","date":1729010015000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple today introduced the new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, supercharged\nby the A17 Pro chip and Apple Intelligence, the easy-to-use\npersonal intelligence system that understands personal context to\ndeliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant while protecting\nuser privacy. With a beloved ultraportable design, the new iPad\nmini is available in four gorgeous finishes, including a new blue\nand purple, and features the brilliant 8.3-inch Liquid Retina\ndisplay. A17 Pro delivers a huge performance boost for even the\nmost demanding tasks, with a faster CPU and GPU, a 2× faster\nNeural Engine than the previous-generation iPad mini, and support\nfor Apple Intelligence. The versatility and advanced capabilities\nof the new iPad mini are taken to a whole new level with support\nfor Apple Pencil Pro, opening up entirely new ways to be even more\nproductive and creative. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Starting at just $499 with 128GB — double the storage of the\nprevious generation — the new iPad mini delivers incredible value\nand the full iPad experience in an ultraportable design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The volume buttons have been moved to the top, the same side as the Touch ID “top button”, presumably to make room for the magnetic Apple Pencil Pro connection. Interesting that it sports the A17 Pro, not the regular A17.</p>\n\n<p>Also interesting that it still uses Touch ID, not Face ID. Not surprising though — the iPad Mini has always been sort of, but not quite, a mini iPad Air. And in the iPad lineup, Face ID remains a Pro-exclusive feature.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/15/new-ipad-mini\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"020b5e1492d64e657a71074e97d76deb37e5c8fae9f6771ec3c7e3adcbb6b80e","category":"Tech"}
