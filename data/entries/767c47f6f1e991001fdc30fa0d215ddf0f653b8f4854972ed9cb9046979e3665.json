The entry-level M3 model replaces the aging 13-inch MacBook Pro with a new design and upgraded display. It also gets HDMI and an SD card reader like the higher-end Pro models. And the M3 Pro models now come in Space Black, the first new Pro color in more than a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2124958/16-inch-macbook-pro-m3-max-review.html\">4.5-star review of the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, we praised the new color and chip and concluded that anyone still using an older MacBook Pro “really missing out if you stick with Intel.” So go grab one while the price is better than ever.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"767c47f6f1e991001fdc30fa0d215ddf0f653b8f4854972ed9cb9046979e3665","category":"Apple"}
