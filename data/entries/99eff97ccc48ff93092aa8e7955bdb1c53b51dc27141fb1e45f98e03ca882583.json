Such large arrays are necessary because the spacecraft will spend much of its 12-year journey about five times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Lucy's solar panels can only generate about 3 percent of the energy at a Jovian distance than they can at Earth's orbit around the Sun.</p>\n\n<p>The solar panels are critical. Mission scientists say that Lucy will travel farther from the Sun, for a longer time, than any previous solar-powered spacecraft.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804931#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804931&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"99eff97ccc48ff93092aa8e7955bdb1c53b51dc27141fb1e45f98e03ca882583","category":"Tech"}
