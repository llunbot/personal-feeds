Nopinz says it’s designed to give you an aero edge in your gravel race. It’s available for men and women, comes in three colours and in a wide range of sizes, priced at £199.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes it gravel-specific? The Pro-1 suit has reinforcing Dyneema anti-abrasion panels built into the hip area, so that if you crash out you’re likely to inflict less damage on yourself than with a standard skinsuit or bib shorts.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n

fabrics used in the arms and upper back have also been chosen for optimised aerodynamics at lower speeds, while other fabric choices help to keep you cooler.

There are seven sizes from 2XS to 2XL, as well as standard and tall fits. Nopinz says the skinsuit weighs 350g. It’s priced at £199.99 and lead time from order is between 10 and 14 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With gravel racing increasingly popular, it’s spawning a whole raft of go-faster gravel tech, from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">aero gravel bikes</a> and deeper section gravel wheelsets to kit designed to help you go faster as well as longer. There’s even a UCI-sponsored <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-gravel-world-championships-2022-tech\">Gravel World Championships</a> (although many riders were on road bikes for this) so a gravel-specific aero skinsuit feels like a logical extension of the gravel racing trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Head to our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/bikes/gravel-adventure-and-cyclocross\">gravel, adventure and cyclocross</a> hub for more gravel-related news</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/gravel-skinsuit-nopinz\">Gravel-specific skinsuits are here: Nopinz launches onesie for the dirt with extra crash protection</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4e2a9bcd88ec4832b65e51d90e4f25233670a4ad47e8c38642ae725a2165fdf5","category":"Cycling"}
