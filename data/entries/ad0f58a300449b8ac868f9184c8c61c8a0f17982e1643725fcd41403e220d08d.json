Designed to fit inside you tire attached to the base of your existing tubeless valves, this Outrider TPMS solution aims to bring live tire pressure monitoring within reach of a lot more cyclists. Bike TPMS does not have to be super expensive, bulky, and it does not need to be overly complicated. Just like most modern cars have neatly integrated TPMS into their valves, Outrider wants to give cyclists the same benefits without a lot of extra complication…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outrider lightweight &amp; affordable bicycle tire pressure monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Outrider-TPMS_lightweight-affordable-bicycle-bike-tire-pressure-monitoring-sensors-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Outrider-TPMS_lightweight-affordable-bicycle-bike-tire-pressure-monitoring-sensors-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Outrider TPMS, a lightweight affordable bicycle bike tire pressure monitoring sensor solution, preview\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Outrider-TPMS_lightweight-affordable-bicycle-bike-tire-pressure-monitoring-sensors-jpg.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Outrider-TPMS_lightweight-affordable-bicycle-bike-tire-pressure-monitoring-sensors-297x163.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Outrider-TPMS_lightweight-affordable-bicycle-bike-tire-pressure-monitoring-sensors-120x66.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Outrider-TPMS_lightweight-affordable-bicycle-bike-tire-pressure-monitoring-sensors-768x422.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Outride)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping correct pressure in your tires is a matter of control, comfort, and ultimately rider safety. But in reality, a lot of cyclists don’t really check their tire pressure all that often. Or simply squeeze the tires to see if they ‘feel’ about right. And now that so many of us ride bikes with tubeless sealant inside, you could get a small puncture that fixes itself after losing a bit of pressure or even have dried-up sealant inside and slowly lose pressure over time without really noticing it. And of course, either scenario just increases the chances that you could get an unexpected flat while out on a ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But often <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=TPMS\" target=\"_blank\">bike TPMS</a> is either costly, or clunky.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Outrider is there to make your life easier.

Of course, supporting a crowdfunded project from a new company is nowhere near as sure as ordering from an established company. But it seems like Outrider has a reasonably-priced and relatively simple solution to bike  tire pressure monitoring, and they certainly have enough funding to get it off the ground now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a few Early Bird deals left to get a pair of Outrider sensors for $55, or 30% off their ultimate retail price. Or 2 pairs for $89 for 44% off. And if you back now, Outrider says they’ll already start shipping the sensors in just a few months, in January 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://outride-bike.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Outride-bike.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/outrider-tpms-lightweight-affordable-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitoring-sensors/\">Outrider TPMS Puts Light, Affordable Tire Pressure Sensor Inside, On Your Tubeless Valve</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ad0f58a300449b8ac868f9184c8c61c8a0f17982e1643725fcd41403e220d08d","category":"Cycling"}
