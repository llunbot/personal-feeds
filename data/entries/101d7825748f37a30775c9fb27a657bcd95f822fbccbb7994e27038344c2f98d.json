That's later than several other sources, which have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/\">centered on 2025</a>. However, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25793\">The Elec</a></em>, problems relating to high manufacturing costs and production yields remain the biggest obstacles to mass production of the microLED Apple Watch Ultra and could even delay the release beyond 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has reportedly been working on custom microLED display technology for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/\">almost a decade</a>. The advanced display offers improved brightness, color reproduction, dynamic range, viewing angles, and efficiency, making images look more like they are \"painted\" atop the display glass. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, whereas the upcoming microLED model is expected to feature a 2.12-inch screen. Apple's problem is that the cost of manufacturing a screen with such a high pixel density is still considered prohibitive for a device that currently sells for $799. According to the report, simulation yields indicate a 2.12-inch screen costs as much as $150, which is four times the cost of producing the existing OLED display ($38). As a benchmark, consumer sales of products with a panel price of $150 are usually around $1,500.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor example, $150 is more expensive than it costs to make the OLED displays for the 6.1-inch and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15, which are $80 and $120, respectively. In terms of the cost of the panel right now, the microLED Apple Watch Ultra would have a higher price tag than Apple's latest premium iPhones. The issue is so problematic that even a 2027 release for the device could be overly optimistic, claims today's report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to have plans to replace all of its existing LCD, OLED, and mini-LED panels with microLED in the long term, with the technology being designed to be scaled up from the Apple Watch to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro headset. The project is part of Apple's plan to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/\">reduce its reliance on Samsung</a> as a supplier while reaping benefits from engineering its own displays in-house. But unless the company can get all its ducks in a row on the component supply chain side, microLED adoption could still be some way off.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/micro-led/\">Micro-LED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/2026-microled-apple-watch-ultra-delays/\">MicroLED Apple Watch Ultra May Be Delayed Due to Supply Chain Issues</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microled-apple-watch-ultra-may-be-delayed-due-to-supply-chain-issues.2418622/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"101d7825748f37a30775c9fb27a657bcd95f822fbccbb7994e27038344c2f98d","category":"Apple"}
