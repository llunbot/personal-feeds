The 3-month-old company plans to focus on developing what it calls \"safe\" AI systems that surpass human capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The fundraising effort shows that even amid <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai--too-much-spend,-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf\">growing skepticism</a> around massive investments in AI tech that so far have failed to be profitable, some backers are still willing to place large bets on high-profile talent in foundational AI research. Venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, DST Global, and SV Angel participated in the SSI funding round.</p>\n<p>SSI aims to use the new funds for computing power and attracting talent. With only 10 employees at the moment, the company intends to build a larger team of researchers across locations in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Reuters reported.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047175#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047175&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51db31fb2d9fad10a3f2c7e847129f9bc3088121e1eaaf52ab3f5ea492607486","category":"Tech"}
