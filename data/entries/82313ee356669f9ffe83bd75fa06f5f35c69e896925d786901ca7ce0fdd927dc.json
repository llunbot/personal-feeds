There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's December 13, and today's image comes from a company that images other objects in spaceâ€”HEO Space. It reveals one of the two Project Kuiper satellites currently undergoing testing in low-Earth orbit.</p>\n<p>Project Kuiper is Amazon's answer to SpaceX's Starlink satellite Internet constellation. However, in the run-up to the October launch of the first two demonstration satellites on an Atlas V rocket, Amazon was super secretive about the satellites. It released almost no technical details or any photos. So this in-space image is the best we've got for now.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990622#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990622&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"82313ee356669f9ffe83bd75fa06f5f35c69e896925d786901ca7ce0fdd927dc","category":"Tech"}
