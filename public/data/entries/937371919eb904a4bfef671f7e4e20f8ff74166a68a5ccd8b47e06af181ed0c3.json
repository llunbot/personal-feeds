Phone manufacturers show little interest in dropping their prices to accommodate customers’ budget worries; in fact, many have had to increase them in response to their own costs going up. Few of us can afford to splash out on a brand-new flagship handset as we may have done in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn’t mean, however, that budget-focused tech fans have to go without entirely, particularly when value-conscious suppliers like giffgaff are offering substantial savings on high-quality handsets from Samsung. With great deals in the firm’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.giffgaff.com/mobile-phones/sale&amp;xcust=1-1-1533545-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">latest round of discounts</a>, you can afford to buy a phone with impressive specs and features without breaking the bank. The trick is to choose one of the legacy models from a year or two ago: the technology is still superb, but the price is far lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, for example, is available from giffgaff for £499, down from £599: that’s a handy 17 percent saving. The S20 FE features a gorgeous, super-smooth 120Hz 6.5-inch AMOLED display, a trio of highly capable rear-facing cameras, a 32MP selfie camera, and great battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5719&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giffgaff.com%2Fmobile-phones%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g%2Fnew&amp;clickref=1-1-1533545-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Take a look at giffgaff’s Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G deal here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>£100 discount applied to Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G.
