The Peak SL Race Tubeless Complete, which uses a single-ply <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mtb-tyre-carcass-construction/\">120 TPI casing</a>, is priced at £54.99/$75 /€60, and the Peak SL Tubeless Ready, which uses a dual-ply 60 TPI casing, is £43/$60/€48.</p>\n<p>Both tyres come with black sidewalls, while the Race version is available with trendy tan walls.</p>\n<p>Goodyear says the new tyre will be available later this month.</p>\n<h2>Lightweight casings</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Goodyear Peak SL tyre tread\" title=\"Goodyear Peak SL tyre tread\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Peak SL has been designed for use on the front and rear wheel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Goodyear</i></span></div>\n<p>The new tyre sits below the Peak in Goodyear’s range of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a> and is focused on racing rather than use on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">downcountry bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Compared to the dual-ply 60 TPI casing, the new Peak SL Race uses a single-ply 120 TPI casing, which the brand says helps in weight reduction.</p>\n<p>Goodyear says puncture protection and durability remain the same, with the new tyre featuring M:Wall sidewall protection. This uses a durable mono fabric around the tyre where abrasions are most common.</p>\n<p>The brand says the Race casing makes the tyre more supple over bumps, adding grip while also helping to maintain a faster rolling speed.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Goodyear Peak SL tyre in XC race\" title=\"Goodyear Peak SL tyre in XC race\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Goodyear says the Peak SL marks an expansion into the cross-country racing segment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Goodyear</i></span></div>\n<p>The Peak SL Race has a claimed weight of 680g for a 29×2.35in tyre, with the high-volume 2.4in version weighing 30g more at 710g.</p>\n<p>The Peak SL is slightly heavier at 775g for the 29×2.4in size.</p>\n<p>Both models use the brand’s Dynamic All Terrain rubber compound, which is said to offer high rolling speeds while maintaining good levels of grip to minimise power loss.</p>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8ea3ad14c0e88634da3ad1d5a624ced6f637299a3d841b5cc5603e3236dacb58","category":"Cycling"}
