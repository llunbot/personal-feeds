[...]</p>\n\n<p>App Review has always long been a major source of developer\nfrustration. Authoritarian yet inconsistent policy enforcement\naside, it’s simply too hard to distribute software <em>even to your\nown Apple devices</em>, let alone someone else’s. This isn’t new by\nany means, but as the time to build an app shrinks from\nweeks/months to hours/days, it feels more egregious — and thus\nlike more of a liability — than ever before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking piece. I feel like Irace is onto something here that I haven’t seen anyone put their finger on before.</p>\n\n<p>The App Store, when it debuted, made developers deliriously happy. The UIKit frameworks (a.k.a. CocoaTouch), Objective-C, and Xcode were all way better ways to create apps for mobile devices than anything else at the time. And for distribution, going through Apple and the App Store was way easier, way more democratic, and 70/30 was way more generous to developers than anything from the various phone carriers around the world. You’d be lucky to get a 30/70 split from the carriers, and they’d only deal with large corporate developers. There were no indie or hobbyist mobile app developers before the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>17 years is a long time, though. And developers long ago stopped seeing the App Store as something that makes them happy, or that <em>reduces</em> friction and hassle from their lives. Instead they view it as a major source of friction and hassle. Apple should have focused on keeping the App Store as a thing that makes developers (mostly) happy all along, not (as things stand today) mostly miserable.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the threat to Apple that the App Store poses is <em>not</em> regulators coming for it. That’s a distraction. The threat, as I’ve <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut\">long tried to argue</a>, perhaps unsuccessfully, is that market forces will work against it eventually. Developers have long grown resentful toward the technical and bureaucratic hassles of publishing through the App Store, and the size of the purchase commissions Apple keeps for itself. Apple’s commission percentages haven’t grown over time, but a 70/30 or even <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/\">85/15 split</a> that in 2008 seemed remarkably generous today seems like a platform engaging in usury and abusive rent-seeking.</p>\n\n<p>AI might be the disruption that brings about the “eventually”, because now it’s coming for the developer tooling experience too. If Apple’s native programming frameworks and developer tools aren’t the best, most satisfying, most productive ways to create great apps, what’s left that makes developers happy to be creating for the iOS platform?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/irace-vibe-killing\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1332dd6bd2503b3cd62858deaf424c2908f0f245fe4ce7eb15f92bca98944cd5","category":"Tech"}
