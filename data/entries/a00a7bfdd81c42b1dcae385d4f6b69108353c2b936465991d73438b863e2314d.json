Below, we recap rumors about the next-generation Apple TV, including new features and lower pricing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe current Apple TV 4K was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-announces-apple-tv-with-a15-and-hdr10-for-129/\">introduced in October 2022</a>. Key new features compared to the previous model from 2021 include a faster A15 Bionic chip, a larger 128GB storage option, a slightly thinner and lighter design, HDR10+ support, a USB-C port on the Siri Remote, a lower $129 starting price vs. $179, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/19/10-new-features-of-2022-apple-tv/\">more</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/\">new Apple TV was on track for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>With only one month remaining in the first half of 2024, it is unclear if this timeframe remains accurate. A new Apple TV could be unveiled at the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/\">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, but no hardware announcements have been firmly rumored for the event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRegardless of when it is unveiled, the next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/\">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/\">could have a sub-$100 starting price</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the second-generation (2010) and third-generation (2012) versions of the Apple TV were priced at $99 in the U.S. at launch, and Apple eventually lowered the price of the third-generation model to $69, so there is precedent for a sub-$100 Apple TV that would better compete with low-priced streaming devices sold by Google, Amazon, and Roku.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/\">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/\">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould the WWDC keynote pass without any new Apple TV announcement, then there will no longer be any active rumor for when the next model might launch.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/latest-apple-tv-rumors/\">Apple TV: The Latest Rumors About a New Model and Possible $99 Price</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-the-latest-rumors-about-a-new-model-and-possible-99-price.2427662/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a00a7bfdd81c42b1dcae385d4f6b69108353c2b936465991d73438b863e2314d","category":"Apple"}
