But for most people, the Apple Watch SE is all they need and today it’s cheaper than ever: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smart-Silver-Aluminum/dp/B0BDJJXWJJ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling all Apple Watch SE models for $50 off</a> as part of its October Prime Day sale, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smart-Silver-Aluminum/dp/B0BDHTRVPP/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">bringing the 41mm model to $199</a>, the lowest price we’ve ever seen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE has the same design and display as the Series 6 from 2020 but without a few key features, including an always-on display, blood-oxygen sensor, and ECG sensor. It also has an older chip but everything else is there: Heart rate sensor, irregular heart rhythm notifications, fall detection, noise monitoring, always-on altimeter, sleep monitoring, 18-hour battery life, and 50M water resistance. And with the latest update, it now has Crash Detection as well and is ready for watchOS 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple won’t be updating the SE until at least next year, so go grab it at its best price ever. </p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"486eb36756d4f239885e62918e72facbb027f5cb62fb84f3b0972c2d54af836b","category":"Apple"}
