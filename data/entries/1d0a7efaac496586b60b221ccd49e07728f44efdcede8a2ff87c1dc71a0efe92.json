So when years' worth of data on the company's employee and aggregate payroll numbers leaked recently, we were eager to take a deep dive to see what those numbers could tell us about the operation and evolution of a company that <a href=\"https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/steam-statistics.html\">has a hand in the majority of PC gaming transactions</a>.</p>\n<p>The recent data comes from a poorly redacted document in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/judge-brings-dismissed-steam-antitrust-lawsuit-back-from-the-dead/\">Wolfire's antitrust lawsuit against Steam</a>, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1811727326138310962\">first noticed over the weekend by SteamDB's Pavel Djundik</a>. While the key data in the document has now been properly hidden in the court docket, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted\">The Verge captured the raw numbers</a> from a table labeled \"Employee Headcount and Gross Pay Data, 2003-2021.\"</p>\n<p>Breaking down that data by year and department with some simple graphs and statistics, seen below, gives us outsiders a rare partial glimpse into Valve's organization. All told, it's a bit hard to believe that this lynchpin of the PC gaming world has rested on the work of just a few hundred people for many years now.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037435#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037435&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d0a7efaac496586b60b221ccd49e07728f44efdcede8a2ff87c1dc71a0efe92","category":"Tech"}
