That led to experiments investigating the taffy's rheology—how it deforms in response to applied forces—and how the ingredients and taffy-making process contribute to that rheology. The results are described in a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0163715\">new paper</a> published in the journal Physics of Fluids.</p>\n<p>“Taffy is a viscoelastic material—it has properties between a viscous liquid and an elastic solid,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1000897?\">said Chan</a>, now a postdoc in the Fluid Interfaces Group at MIT Media Lab. \"Comparing the deformation behavior of commercial taffy to those of different lab-made sugar syrups and lab-made taffies allowed us to identify the most important taffy ingredient (and material structure) that governs taffy rheology.”</p>\n<p>It's just the latest example of a burgeoning area of research focusing on the science of food—something that's frequently on the menu here at Ars. For instance, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/georgia-tech-physicists-unlock-the-secret-to-perfect-wok-tossed-fried-rice/\">in 2020</a>, physicists examined the physics of wok-tossed fried rice and <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0622\">found that</a> the secret to a perfect dish (i.e., nicely browned but not burnt) was a timely combination of side-to-side and see-sawing motions while cooking. In 2022, MIT physicists <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/04/oreology-investigates-mystery-of-why-oreo-creme-filling-usually-sticks-to-one-side/\">coined the term</a> \"oreology\" for their study of why—when twisting two Oreo cookie halves apart—the creme filling <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/34/4/043107/2844774/On-Oreology-the-fracture-and-flow-of-milk-s\">typically sticks</a> to only one chocolate wafer. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967089#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1967089&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cf65f4fc0920b2e5e227095e5ecb9b4743d0019145bd9852132032c3a714aa57","category":"Tech"}
