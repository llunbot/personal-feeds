Russian President Vladimir <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/as-rumors-swirl-about-his-future-russias-space-chief-darkens-his-rhetoric/\">Putin tersely dismissed Rogozin</a> in July 2022 and replaced him with Yuri Borisov, a former deputy prime minister.</p>\n<p>While the clash between Russia and Western governments over the war in Ukraine has not cooled, the threats against the International Space Station (ISS) ended. The program remains one of the few examples of cooperation between the US and Russian governments. Last year, Russia <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/russia-commits-to-iss-extension-to-2028/\">formally extended its commitment</a> to the ISS to at least 2028. NASA and space agencies in Europe, Japan, and Canada have agreed to maintain the space station through 2030.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051340#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051340&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77d4f16deee58fa6a96516f91ebb32e28d630ad8e9ad0d0c58eec37cab3e6295","category":"Tech"}
