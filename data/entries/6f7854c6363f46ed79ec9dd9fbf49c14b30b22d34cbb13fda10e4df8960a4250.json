Writing Tools, which is an Apple Intelligence feature, is not available to use in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple's Writing Tools include options to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text almost anywhere you can type in iOS 18. A long press in a text input field usually brings up the feature, but not in any of Meta's apps currently. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBrazilian blog <em><a href=\"https://sorcererhat.tech/articles/meta-impede-o-uso-da-apple-intelligence-em-seus-apps\">Sorcererhat Tech</a></em> spotted the lack of Writing Tools across Meta's apps, which appears to have been the case since late last year. Developers can choose whether to allow the tools in their apps, so it looks as if Meta has declined the offer. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-talks-ai-model-ios-18/\">June 2024</a>, Apple held discussions with Meta about integrating the Facebook owner's AI model into iOS 18 as part of its Apple Intelligence feature set. However, Apple turned down the AI partnership due to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-ai-privacy-concerns/\">privacy concerns</a>. Apple instead ended up signing a deal with OpenAI to include optional ChatGPT access in its Siri responses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the history of acrimony between the two companies – from Apple device interoperability demands to App Store feuds – it's not all that surprising that Meta would choose to keep Apple's AI out of its apps. Meta has also since rolled out its own AI features across its platforms.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/apple-intelligence-not-available-in-meta-apps/\">Apple Intelligence Feature Not Available in Meta Apps Like Facebook, Instagram</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-feature-not-available-in-meta-apps-like-facebook-instagram.2455511/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f7854c6363f46ed79ec9dd9fbf49c14b30b22d34cbb13fda10e4df8960a4250","category":"Apple"}
