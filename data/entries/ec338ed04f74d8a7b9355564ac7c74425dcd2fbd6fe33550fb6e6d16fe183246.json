Though the two bikes retain plenty of similarities, the Ultra Race is positioned as more performance-focussed. Jamie Burrow, Ribble’s head of product, says the bike ‘bridges the gap between pure aero and lightweight race models’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will sit as the lightweight <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-round-road-race-bikes\">all-round</a> alternative to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-ribble-ultra-aero-sl-r\">Ultra Aero SL R</a>, Ribble’s dedicated <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\">aero bike</a>, with the Ultra Race frameset weighing 425g less, at a claimed 775g in a size medium. In aerodynamic terms, Ribble claims the Ultra Race is 6 seconds more efficient over 40km than the Endurance SL R at 47kmh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ribble says it has a used a new type of carbon layup in certain areas of the frame called MT65, which, of course, is said to be stronger, stiffer and lighter. The brand claims the use of this aerospace grade carbon is a first in the bike industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-4-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than using the radical Ultra Aero bar tape free bars, the Ultra Race is built up with new integrated one-piece carbon handlebars, though swaps are possible at Ribble’s configuration stage. The geometry is very similar to the outgoing Endurance SL R with only slight modifications, and tyre clearance is 32mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is only one grade of frame available. Prices for complete bikes range from £3,699 for a Shimano 105 Di2 and Mavic Ksyrium 30 wheels, up to the top spec £10,499 SRAM Red AXS and Scope Artech 4 wheels. The latter build weighs a reported 6.58kg.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Frameset, carbon layup and weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Lifestyle-8-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frameset of the Ultra Race weighs 775g (size medium) which is light in the aerolight category. For context, it is less than Van Rysel’s 790g RCR but more than the 685g Specialized Tarmac SL8 and the 730g Factor O2 VAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses slimmer, less aerofoil-shaped tubing than the Ultra SL R but Ribble says the down tube and head tube in particular have inherited their profiles from the aero bike. Ribble has also designed proprietary aero bottle cages for the Ultra Race which take round circumference bidons, while the enlarged bottom bracket junction contains a threaded BSA bottom bracket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-Black-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\"

combination of 33-, 46- and 65-ton carbon, whereas the Endurance SL R uses a combination of lower modulus 30- and 33-ton carbon which is stronger, but heavier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ribble claims this contributes to significant improvements in stiffness to weight, amounting to a 75g lighter frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame also uses an aerospace grade MT65 carbon fibre, which Ribble says is a first

three colours (red, white and black) and has tyre clearance of 32mm. While the bikes will come specced with 30mm tyres, Ribble will allow you to swap them for 32mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry is largely comparable to the previous Endurance SL R but with a few important changes. While a 9mm higher 550mm stack on the Ultra Race actually suggests a less aerodynamic profile, the 388mm reach has gotten ever so slightly longer, by 3mm, giving riders slightly more room to stretch out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ribble offers two different fork offsets, 55 and 45, to cover the six different frame sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front centre is 7mm longer at 591mm, though the chainstays have been shortened by 5mm to 410mm, contributing to a 6mm shorter wheelbase overall – a figure which varies across sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The angles of the head and seat tube haven’t been changed, standing at 72.5 and 73.5 degrees respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ribble Ultra Race specs and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White.webp 800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Ribble-ULTRA-RACE-Cockpit-White-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ribble Ultra Race is only available with electronic groupsets.
