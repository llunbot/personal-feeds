Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>COMO, ITALY—BMW has earned a reputation for challenging car designs. It's not a new thing, either. People mocked the Z1's disappearing doors. The Z3 coupe's \"clown shoe\" nickname was not at all affectionate. And few could find a kind word about the infamous \"Bangle butt\" on the fourth-gen 7 Series. But it doesn't take those kinds of risks with every model, particularly not the latest 5 Series, which now includes a fully electric i5.</p>\n<p>The 5 Series is BMW's midsize sedan, and until the advent of the luxury SUV—a category that BMW basically invented—it was the company's bread and butter. There's a new 5 Series out this October, the eighth generation to bear the nameplate. Like other recent BMWs, it uses the manufacturer's latest flexible architecture that supports battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and conventional powertrains, something we've seen to good effect with the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-2023-bmw-i4-is-the-electric-bmw-sedan-youve-been-waiting-for/\">4 Series</a> and particularly with last year's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/how-the-the-wire-helped-me-understand-the-2023-bmw-760i-xdrive/\">7 Series</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/testing-bmws-biggest-and-best-sedan-now-fully-electric-the-2023-i7/\">i7</a>.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2024-BMW-i5-preview-12-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"Now try to picture it wearing a taxi livery or perhaps a police version.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2024-BMW-i5-preview-12-980x735.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2024-BMW-i5-preview-12-scaled.jpg\">Now try to picture it wearing a taxi livery or perhaps a police version.</a> (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p></div>\n<h2>The sedan is not dead</h2>\n<p>\"We're particularly happy with how it turned out proportion-wise. I think it is a long, elegant, sporty sedan, and that, for me, is the essence of any BMW anyway. And the 5 series, of course, is the core of the brand in many, many markets,\" said Adrian van Hooydonk, design director at BMW Group.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941561#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941561&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
