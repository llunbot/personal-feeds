Together, these developments suggest that Apple is working on a version of the HomePod with an integrated touchscreen, a device that rumors have suggested could launch in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd\">or 2025</a>. The company has reportedly been working on a smart home device with a screen <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats\">since at least 2021</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035899#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035899&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"999823505aa98c4ed00dab2f744dc37330699b018d1da46d687cdbf5b6784702","category":"Tech"}
