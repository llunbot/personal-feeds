However, the U.S. and some other countries have moved to ban DeepSeek on government devices due to privacy concerns.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is required to work with a local Chinese company to develop artificial intelligence models for devices sold in China. The report said Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/\">targeted Baidu as its partner</a> last year, but Apple eventually decided that Baidu did not meet its standards, leading it to assess models from other companies in recent months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report said Apple has assessed models developed by Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance, and it appears to be moving forward on a partnership with Alibaba at this time. Apple and Alibaba have submitted a first set of artificial intelligence features that they co-developed to China's cyberspace regulator for approval, the report said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-intelligence-eight-new-languages-april/\">gain support for additional languages this year</a>, including Chinese, according to Apple. The next set of new languages are coming in an April software update. However, this Chinese language support might be limited to countries outside of China until if and when Apple Intelligence is approved to launch there.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-reportedly-passed-over-deepseek/\">Apple Reportedly 'Passed Over' DeepSeek as Apple Intelligence Partner</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-passed-over-deepseek-as-apple-intelligence-partner.2449177/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cd2e60bdff05cb4e91727b12fc7dec35c3716a2adf9e08dc987b231fff7e84d9","category":"Apple"}
