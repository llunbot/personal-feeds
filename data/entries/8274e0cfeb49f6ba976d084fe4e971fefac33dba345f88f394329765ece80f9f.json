It is turned on through the DuckDuckGo browser so a second app is not required, and it does filter traffic through all apps and browsers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuckDuckGo's personal information removal tool regularly scans 50 sites that sell information, such as Spokeo. Personal information is stored on device, and removal requests are initiated using the information provided during setup. The process is automated, and there is a dashboard to monitor results.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIdentity theft restoration includes the support of a dedicated advisor that will work with users to restore stolen accounts, replace bank cards and other identifying documents, recover financial losses, and correct credit reports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrivacy Pro from DuckDuckGo is <a href=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/\">priced at $9.99 per month</a> or $99.99 per year, and it is currently only available in the United States.
