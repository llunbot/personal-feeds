Moots, long known for their high-end titanium bicycles surprised everyone with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/moots-express-carbon-e-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">a carbon fiber gravel e-bike</a>, using a frame material they’ve never used before, and adding a motor for the first time in their history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talked to Nate Bradley, Moots’ president and one of the key people behind the new model, about how it came to be, why they did it, and what’s next for the brand. And, of course, we talk about those wild <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-bicycle-wheel-size-moots-prototype-750d-wheels-tires-wtb/\" target=\"_blank\">oversized 750D gravel wheels</a> and tires they showed off at SBT and the MADE show.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>We also talk about what’s next for Moots, some of the projects they’re working on, and why it seems like they’re on a current roll with rapid product introductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>This Episode Sponsored by:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead Karoo 2 cycling computer ad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250.jpg 970w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-297x77.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-800x206.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-120x31.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970-x-250-768x198.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hammerhead Karoo 2 is the most advanced GPS cycling computer available today, with industry-leading mapping, navigation, and routing capabilities that set it apart from other GPS options.
