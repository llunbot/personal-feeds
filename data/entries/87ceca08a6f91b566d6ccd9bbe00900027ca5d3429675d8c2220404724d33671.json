If you want to get them a tablet that can play games, browse, stream, and all the basics at a fraction of the cost. This <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-ipad-7-32gb-space-gray-wifi-bundle-w-beats-flex-headphones-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-ipad-7-32gb-space-gray-wifi-bundle-w-beats-flex-headphones-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-615517&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003OtWHIA0&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">7th Gen iPad</a> is in near-mint condition, but it costs a whole lot less than brand new, and it even comes with Beats Headphones, a case, screen protector, stylus, and charger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 10.2-inch Retina display, this iPad is perfect for watching videos, drawing, or tackling schoolwork. The A10 Fusion chip keeps everything running smoothly, whether they’re gaming or switching between apps, and 32GB of storage gives them plenty of space for their favorite stuff. Plus, with up to 10 hours of battery life, they won’t have to hunt for a charger every few hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don’t forget the Beats Flex Wireless Headphones. These Bluetooth earbuds sound great, feel comfortable, and won’t get tangled up like regular wired ones. They even have magnetic earbuds that automatically pause the music when clipped together. With up to 12 hours of battery life, they can jam out all day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this bundle comes with a case, stylus, screen protector, and charger, you’re getting everything in one go.
