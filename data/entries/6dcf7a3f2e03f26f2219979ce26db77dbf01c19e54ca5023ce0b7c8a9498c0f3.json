The lesser-known jewel of the Balkans, Zadar is a seaside city boasting Roman and Venetian ruins and a panoply of cycling routes for the intrepid rider – not to mention enticing beaches and Mediterranean sunshine for most of the year. A pretty good recipe for a cycling holiday, all in all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The active vacation experts at ZZUUM, based in the region of Zadar, have a wealth of local riding knowledge and years of experience curating self-guided cycle trips. ZZUUM is a collective of local guides and adventure cycling enthusiasts who are passionate about sharing the rich possibilities of Zadar and its surrounds. Whether you’re looking to meander around sleepy islands on untouched gravel paths or race down smooth descents, the wide range of itineraries has every angle covered. Plus, ZZUUM takes care of all the administration and organisation, leaving you to simply focus on enjoying the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Incredible landscapes</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Dalmatian coastline is stunningly beautiful – there’s no two ways about it. Rocky outcrops and secluded bays plunge away into disarmingly clear blue water: dipping into them is a great way to start and finish any ride. This part of Croatia is dotted with peninsulas and islands, so tours will include ferry crossings for tired legs as the sun sets over the Adriatic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though there is no shortage of pristine coastline to explore, Zadar has just as much to offer when you turn inland. Expect to wind your way through lush countryside and diverse terrain as you navigate every road and trail the region has to offer. Hidden gems like Nin, Biograd and the Vrana Lake Nature Park feature in the varied itinerary.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Nin is the oldest royal Croatian city which contains the world’s smallest cathedral, while Biograd is famous for its marina and pine-sheltered beaches. The Vrana Lake Nature Park covers 57km² and is home to the country’s largest lake. Countless wild birds and amphibious creatures inhabit the brackish water.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pick and choose</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you have in mind, ZZUUM has a variety of different trips available. The <a href=\"https://zzuum.com/cycling-holidays/biking-in-croatia/\" target=\"_blank\">eight-day, 315km Undiscovered Zadar ride</a>, for instance, doesn’t just weave its way along the rugged coast of the Croatian mainland. You will explore Ugljan and Vir Island on touring bikes, dive in and out of olive groves, vineyards and charming villages – all while soaking up panoramic views of the Adriatic see at every turn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entirety of the route’s itinerary has been carefully curated to ensure that riders’ experiences are varied and comprehensive. No two days are the same and the achievable daily mileage ensures that there will be ample chance to experience the ins and outs of local culture.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In addition to this touring-bike excursion, ZZUUM can also curate e-bike and mountain bike trips to suit riders’ needs. There is a dedicated workshop on site to make sure bikes are kept running smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Not for the faint of heart</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling in Zadar may well be jaw-droppingly beautiful, but first and foremost it is an adventure. The terrain is so varied that every day of riding presents a new surprise and a different challenge. The self-guided tours from ZZUUM provide a balance of structure and autonomy, so you can benefit from local knowledge and insight but ride and experience the Croatian culture at your own pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A new perspective</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-5.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Seeing a country by bike is a unique experience that is distinctive from other kinds of travelling. Spinning along at the perfect ground-level pace will allow you to take in miles and miles of unspoilt Croatian landscape, with the freedom to stop and soak up the local flavour in small villages or immerse yourself in larger, more vibrant centres like Zadar and Biograd. Cycling is a key component in the texture of the trip, but so too is pausing to remember that you’re on holiday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Easy access</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting to Croatia couldn’t be much easier thanks to Zadar’s excellent airport links with the UK, where it is possible to fly direct from London, Leeds, Liverpool and several other UK cities. Convenience is also baked into every ZZUUM expedition as the logistics are taken care of and included in the price. This includes accommodation, bike rental, ferry tickets, GPX routes, entry to national parks and catering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Off the beaten track</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zzuum-zadar-7.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Dalmatian coast is a well-known and popular summer holiday destination, but while the likes of Split, Hvar and Dubrovnik are very busy during the summer season, thanks to Zadar’s lesser-known status the region retains an authentic and low-key atmosphere compared to its more touristy neighbours. That said, Zadar is still a city of 70,000 people, so between the rich history and the vibrant bar and restaurant scene, there’s a lot to see and do when you’ve stopped pedalling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For adventurous cyclists who are keen to explore a unique and rewarding part of the world that is a world away from the more predictable cycling destinations we’ve seen and heard so much about, Zadar has a huge amount to offer.
