Singapore’s Ministry of Education <a href=\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20240805-mobile-guardian-device-management-application-to-be-removed-from-personal-learning-devices\">said Monday</a> that roughly 13,000 students from 26 secondary schools had their devices wiped remotely in the incident. The agency said it will remove the Mobile Guardian from all iPads and Chromebooks it issues.</p>\n<h2>Second breach in 4 months</h2>\n<p>Also on Monday, Mobile Guardian revealed its platform had been breached in a “security incident that affected users globally, including on the North America, European, and Singapore instances. This resulted in a small percentage of devices to be unenrolled from Mobile Guardian and their devices wiped remotely. There is no evidence to suggest that the perpetrator had access to users’ data.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041407#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041407&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c1b3178e1d62164e1ccaef8126dc6de7e5dbf5db2af5b898a2839c005fe7149a","category":"Tech"}
