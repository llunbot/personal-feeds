However, based on recent supply chain checks, Pu believes the stacked sensor is likely facing yield issues that could result in iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus production delays. The devices are still expected to launch in September as of now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first introduced a 48-megapixel camera lens <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-14-pro-take-48-megapixel-proraw-photos/\">on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> last year. The lens enables users to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos, which retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu was first to report that iPhone 15 Pro models would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons/\">no longer feature solid-state buttons</a> due to \"design issues.\" He still expects iPhone 15 Pro models to feature a titanium frame, an upgraded A17 Bionic chip, an increased 8GB of RAM, and more, and he reiterated that all four iPhone 15 models will have a USB-C port.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/14/iphone-15-and-15-plus-48mp-camera/\">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus Rumored to Feature 48-Megapixel Camera Like Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-plus-rumored-to-feature-48-megapixel-camera-like-pro-models.2389515/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c35c71f0432d1550b10a5d625e46a72125fe13416161dadbab1387fc3f8fc857","category":"Apple"}
