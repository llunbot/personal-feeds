Still in its fourth generation—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/mazda-mx-5-miata-still-brilliant-after-almost-30-years/\">better known to Miata nerds as the \"ND\"</a>—this small, affordable, lightweight sports car is the perfect antidote to, well, just about everything else on the roads. And to celebrate this latest milestone, Mazda has created a new special anniversary edition, which it unveiled at this past weekend's Rolex 24 at Daytona.</p>\n<p>When the Miata debuted in 1989, it was something of a game-changer. Inspired by classic European roadsters like those built by MG and Alfa Romeo, it was small, lithe, and, most importantly, reliable. It didn't hurt that it looked nice and was great to drive.</p>\n<p>It's also been something of a hit among amateur racers—Mazda is proud that each weekend, more Miatas are on track than any other make of car. That goes some way to explaining why Mazda chose this year's Rolex 24 at Daytona to reveal the new 35th Anniversary Edition—the MX-5 Cup series is probably IMSA's most exciting support series.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/mazda-celebrates-35-years-of-the-mx-5-with-anniversary-model/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/mazda-celebrates-35-years-of-the-mx-5-with-anniversary-model/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
