Wonder.</em> </p></div>\n<p>Playing <i>Super Mario Bros.

Wonder </i>could have easily been a gimmick—the kind of repetitive, minor alterations to the status quo that help check a box on the game packaging. Instead, the Wonder Flower effects provide a much-needed shot in the arm that keeps the game from falling into anything approaching a predictable rut.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976619#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976619&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8efb816d05f6105edb59d55e804130fd105a4461950fa4d6de58d75079e53e22","category":"Tech"}
