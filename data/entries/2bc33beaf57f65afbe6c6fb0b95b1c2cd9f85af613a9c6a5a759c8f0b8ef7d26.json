But fuck these “religious” exemptions. If your “religion” forbids you from being vaccinated, that’s not a religion, that’s a cult.</p>\n\n<p>So where’s Apple on this? Why isn’t Apple requiring proof of vaccination for employees, including for retail employees and customers? Why reserve courageous decisions only for removing headphone jacks?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/10/microsoft-vaccination-mandate\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2bc33beaf57f65afbe6c6fb0b95b1c2cd9f85af613a9c6a5a759c8f0b8ef7d26","category":"Tech"}
