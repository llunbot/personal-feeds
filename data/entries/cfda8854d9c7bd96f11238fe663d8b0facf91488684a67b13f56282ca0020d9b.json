Court records and public data suggest that these cameras \"played a role in dozens of arrests,\" the Post found, but most uses were never disclosed in police reports.</p>\n<p>That seems like a problem, the Post reported, since a 2022 city council ordinance required much more oversight for the tech. Rather than instantly detaining supposed suspects the second they pop up on live feeds, cops were only supposed to use the tech to find \"specific suspects in their investigations of violent crimes,\" the Post reported. And in those limited cases, the cops were supposed to send images to a \"fusion center,\" where at least two examiners \"trained in identifying faces\" using AI software had to agree on alleged matches before cops approached suspects.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/cops-pause-use-of-flawed-ai-cameras-secretly-monitoring-streets-for-suspects/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/cops-pause-use-of-flawed-ai-cameras-secretly-monitoring-streets-for-suspects/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cfda8854d9c7bd96f11238fe663d8b0facf91488684a67b13f56282ca0020d9b","category":"Tech"}
