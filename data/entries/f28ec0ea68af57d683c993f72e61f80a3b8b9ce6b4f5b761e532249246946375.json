{"title":"Christopher Nolan on John August’s Script Notes Podcast","link":"https://johnaugust.com/2023/the-one-with-christopher-nolan","date":1703101051000,"content":"\n<p>John August:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>John welcomes writer and director Christopher Nolan (<em>The Dark \nKnight</em>, <em>Inception</em>) to discuss experimentation, subjectivity and \nadaptation as they take an in-depth look at his screenplay, \n<em>Oppenheimer</em>. They explore Chris’ writing process, how to make \nnon-linear structures work, finding the story in real-life events, \nbeing kinetic on the page, the importance of embracing editing, \nand why theme can be a tricky thing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just a terrific interview; Nolan is as cogent as you’d expect. Even if you don’t write screenplays, I think his advice and experience are applicable to any creative endeavor, in terms of how to translate nebulous <em>ideas</em> churning around in your head into a concrete written description or plan. Writing is thinking, and it’s in the writing of ideas that they become fully formed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/20/nolan-august-script-notes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f28ec0ea68af57d683c993f72e61f80a3b8b9ce6b4f5b761e532249246946375","category":"Tech"}
