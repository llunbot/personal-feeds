For one, the coaster brake has been upgraded to a <a href=\"http://www.monebikes.com/store/hot-rod-coaster-brake-wheel\" target=\"_blank\">Moné Bad Ass Coaster Wheel</a>. Then it also got three different build kits: a drop bar with big ass tires (pictured here – $4150), the same build kit but with moto riser bars ($4395), and then the original Urban Racer with slicks and a fillet brazed bar/stem ($4500). Of course these bikes feature all the Speedvagen accouterment, including the Berserker dropouts, chain guard, and more. The biggest aesthetic change this year, however, has got to be the matching cerakote paint and components.</p>\n<p>These new Urban Racers are built in batches of 11, awaiting orders to be sent off to their new home.
