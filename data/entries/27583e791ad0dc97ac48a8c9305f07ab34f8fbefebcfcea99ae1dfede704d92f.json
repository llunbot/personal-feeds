An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has a March 6 deadline to introduce app sideloading in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/\">iOS 17.4 will add support for this</a>. Sideloading will allow Apple users in Europe to download apps outside of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, but the change will be limited to the EU and won't impact customers in other parts of the world. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's no word yet on what else is included in iOS 17.4, but Apple's updates around this time often introduce new emoji characters. If there are indeed new emoji in the update, we can expect to see the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/\">Unicode 15.1 additions</a>, which include phoenix, lime, an edible mushroom, shaking head vertically (as in a \"yes\" nod), shaking head horizontally (a \"no\" head shake), and broken chain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/\">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-4-and-ipados-17-4-to-developers.2417420/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"27583e791ad0dc97ac48a8c9305f07ab34f8fbefebcfcea99ae1dfede704d92f","category":"Apple"}
