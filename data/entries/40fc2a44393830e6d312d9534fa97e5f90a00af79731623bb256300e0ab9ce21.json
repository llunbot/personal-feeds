{"title":"The Information: ‘Inside Tim Cook’s Secret $275 Billion Deal with Chinese Authorities’","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them","date":1638988047000,"content":"\n<p>Wayne Ma, reporting for The Information (<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?shared=20027b4eacb6c1e5\">free article link for non-subscribers</a>, which requires you to share your email address):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s iPhone recently became the top-selling smartphone in\nChina, its second-biggest market after the U.S., for the first\ntime in six years. But the company owes much of that success to\nCEO Tim Cook, who laid the foundation years ago by secretly\nsigning an agreement, estimated to be worth more than $275\nbillion, with Chinese officials promising Apple would do its part\nto develop China’s economy and technological prowess through\ninvestments, business deals and worker training.</p>\n\n<p>Cook forged the five-year agreement, which hasn’t been previously\nreported, during the first of a series of in-person visits he made\nto the country in 2016 to quash a sudden burst of regulatory\nactions against Apple’s business, according to internal Apple\ndocuments viewed by The Information. Before the meetings, Apple\nexecutives were scrambling to salvage the company’s relationship\nwith Chinese officials, who believed the company wasn’t\ncontributing enough to the local economy, the documents show. Amid\nthe government crackdown and the bad publicity that accompanied\nit, iPhone sales plummeted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a deeply-researched and seemingly amazingly well-sourced story. Extraordinary work by Ma — particularly the Apple internal documents he was able to obtain. The backstory on that must be something. Long story short, Apple’s relationship with China is every bit as complicated, and delicate, as you’d think. I was skeptical about the headline — both the staggering $275 billion figure and the word “secret” — but Ma’s reporting backs it up.</p>\n\n<p>The Information is subscriber-only, and costs $400 a year. That’s a lot, no question, but you get what you pay for. Reporting like this makes it worthwhile to me. I try always to be respectful when linking to paywalled material, and not quote so much as to spoil the whole thing. But I feel compelled to share this nugget:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sometime in 2014 or early 2015, China’s State Bureau of Surveying\nand Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team to make the Diaoyu\nIslands, the objects of a long-running territorial dispute between\nChina and Japan, appear large even when users zoomed out from\nthem. Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of\nthe first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple\ndidn’t comply with the unusual request, according to internal\ndocuments.</p>\n\n<p>Some members of the team back at Apple’s headquarters in\nCupertino, Calif., initially balked at the demand. But the Maps\napp had become a priority for Apple, so eventually the company\ncomplied. The Diaoyu Islands, when viewed in Apple Maps in\nmainland China, continue to appear on a larger scale than\nsurrounding territories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would venture to say that <em>all</em> members of Apple’s Maps team balked at this request. It’s absurd and offensive. Asking professional cartographers to misrepresent the size of islands for propaganda purposes — even if only to users in mainland China — is like asking writers to misspell words or misstate facts, or asking mathematicians to generate incorrect results. It’s contrary to the nature of the profession.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/08/the-information-apple-china\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"40fc2a44393830e6d312d9534fa97e5f90a00af79731623bb256300e0ab9ce21","category":"Tech"}
