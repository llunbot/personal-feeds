They make the world’s fastest tire, and then create some very fast wheel+tire systems. And the best part is, they work at normal speeds, not just pro peloton warp drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Continental Aero 111 road bike tire is the result a collaboration between them, DT Swiss, and SwissSide. We <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-swissside-faster-aero-road-tire-patent/\">covered the patent filing</a> for this in early 2023, and now the tires are finally available. Here’s how they work…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aero gains for all</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1663\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of dt swiss wheels with conti aero 111 tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The project came about as DT Swiss was looking for ways to further improve overall system aerodynamics. They say they were quite happy with their wheels, rims, spokes, and hubs, so the next level was the tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1277\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3.jpg\" alt=\"conti aero 111 tire on dt swiss wheels in the wind tunnel.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They partnered with SwissSide to design it, then brought in Continental to actually make it. By using scooped divots along the tire’s cornering edges, they’re able to smooth the airflow to reduce drag. In their words:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Specially designed aero cavities in the patented tread pattern function as vortex generators, creating turbulent airflow on the surface that enables the air to stick to the rim shape of the front wheel. The result is a maximization of the sailing effect by delaying the flow separation from the rim, resulting in the ultimate aero wheel tire system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more impressive is that the benefit is seen even at normal human speeds:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart.jpg\"><img width=\"1418\" height=\"993\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart.jpg 1418w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-297x208.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-120x84.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-768x538.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Straight on, performance is similar to the popular GP 5000, but it starts to get much faster with any crosswind, even creating negative drag in severe crosswind angles, which keeps it more stable, too. Yes, that’s “negative drag”, also known as propulsion…this wheel/tire system actually makes you faster in crosswinds, but that’s not even the best part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most drag charts we see are at Pro Tour rider speeds of 40-50km/h. This one shows the drag reduction at 30km/h (18.64mph), a speed many of us cruise at all day long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, they say what makes this tire really special is that it can reduce drag so much at low speeds. The chart below shows how its performance is consistent even as you increase your speed to 45km/h, but notice how the GP 5000 changes:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-fast.jpg\"><img width=\"1418\" height=\"994\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-fast.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-fast.jpg 1418w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-fast-297x208.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-fast-120x84.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-fast-768x538.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to a certain point (about 15º wind angle), they say the beneficial “sailing” effect is more pronounced on standard tires at higher speeds, which is a good thing if you can hold 28mph. But for most of us, having a tire that produces improved aerodynamics at 18mph is far more beneficial. But wait, there’s more:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-29mm.jpg\"><img width=\"1418\" height=\"994\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-29mm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-29mm.jpg 1418w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-29mm-297x208.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-29mm-120x84.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Aero-111-tire-drag-comparison-chart-29mm-768x538.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The aerodynamic benefits are exactly the same with the 29mm width, the curve just moves up slightly…sorry, no “negative drag” here. Note that this data is with a shallower rim, but still shows benefits at 30km/h.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summary: The Continential Aero 111 tire is meant as a front tire only, you can use whatever you want out back. They say gains are achieved regardless of rim height, but it’s offered in 26mm and 29mm widths to suit personal preferences. The 26mm will be the most aerodynamic, but for long-distance riders who want something with a bit more volume to improve comfort, the 29mm will still offer more aero benefits than standard tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aero 111 tire details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-cutaway-view.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1086\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-cutaway-view.jpg\" alt=\"cutaway view of conti aero 111 bike tire.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-cutaway-view.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-cutaway-view-297x168.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-cutaway-view-1536x869.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-cutaway-view-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DTSwiss-Continental-AERO-111-Tire-cutaway-view-768x434.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 48 cavities are the key differentiator. The rest should sound familiar for Conti fans. Their Black Chili rubber compound provides wet-and-dry grip and low rolling resistance. An ultralight and tough Vectran breaker sits under the tread cap to resist punctures. and a tubeless-ready casing lets you set it up without tubes for the least rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tubeless compatible with both hooked and hookless rims. Max tire pressure is 72psi on hookless (TSS) rims, and 102psi on hooked (crochet) rims. Claimed weights are 250g (26mm) and 280g (29mm).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dt-swiss-conti-aero-111-wheel-tire-systems-1.jpg\"><img width=\"987\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dt-swiss-conti-aero-111-wheel-tire-systems-1.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss wheels sold with continental aero 111 tires pre-installed.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dt-swiss-conti-aero-111-wheel-tire-systems-1.jpg 987w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dt-swiss-conti-aero-111-wheel-tire-systems-1-297x218.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dt-swiss-conti-aero-111-wheel-tire-systems-1-120x88.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dt-swiss-conti-aero-111-wheel-tire-systems-1-768x565.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Aero wheel-tire systems (WTS) shown with 26mm tires.
