But details around the torrenting were murky until\nyesterday, when Meta’s unredacted emails were made public for the\nfirst time. The new evidence showed that Meta torrented “at least\n81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries through\nthe site Anna’s Archive, including at least 35.7 terabytes of data\nfrom Z-Library and LibGen,” the <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Plaintiffs-Motion-for-Relief-2-5-25.pdf\">authors’ court filing</a> said.\nAnd “Meta also previously torrented 80.6 terabytes of data from\nLibGen.”</p>\n\n<p>Supposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using\nFacebook servers while downloading the dataset to “avoid” the\n“risk” of anyone “tracing back the seeder/downloader” from\nFacebook servers, an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf\">internal message</a> from Meta\nresearcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as being in\n“stealth mode.” Meta also allegedly modified settings “so that the\nsmallest amount of seeding possible could occur,” a Meta executive\nin charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a\n<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf\">deposition</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that\nMeta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be\ndeposed again because the new facts allegedly “contradict prior\ndeposition testimony.” Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to\nhave no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models.\nBut unredacted messages show the “decision to use LibGen occurred”\nafter “a prior escalation to MZ,” authors alleged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regardless of how you feel about AI training on public data, you have to be a zealot not to acknowledge that a lot of stuff falls into a gray zone. Torrenting 81 terrabytes of pirated books is not in the gray zone. It’s hilarious to imagine Zuckerberg giving the OK the pirate all these books, just not from the office.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/meta-torrented-books-ai-training-lawsuit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"985efd2da26d073c69c6111eb836991a93ed558daab0a1d76f5d1c6a84ae4816","category":"Tech"}
