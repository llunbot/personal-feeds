The only real competition for Apple’s most affordable iPad (which starts at $329) are Kindle Fires and some deeply disappointing Android tablets that have retail prices in the $150 range and are often used as free giveaways when you buy service subscriptions or other more expensive tech gear,” we noted at the time.</p>\n\n\n<span>This iPad is only $199 right now</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/\" target=\"_blank\">Get it at Amazon</a></div>\n\n\n<p>The iPad 9th gen boasts a superb 10.2-inch Retina display, providing incredible detail and vivid colors.
