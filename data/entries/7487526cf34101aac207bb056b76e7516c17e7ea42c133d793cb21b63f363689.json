Why not return it in person and check out how it was made, too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m always down for a road trip, and upstate New York is a lovely area to ride, so a few emails later, plans were set and bags were packed. Here’s how No.22 Bicycles makes their gorgeous titanium road and gravel bikes and produces some of the best anodized finishes in the business…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A bit of backstory</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-01-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-01-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - building interior\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-01-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-01-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-01-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-01-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-01-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If starting a handmade bicycle company from scratch seems like a big, complicated process, you may be surprised to know that they shipped their first bike within weeks of opening this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s partly because they started out small. There was only power line to the breaker box, which fed a few lights and outlets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While co-founders Mike and Bryce came from the enthusiast side rather than the cycling industry, they brought several of the designers and builders from Saratoga Frameworks (formerly Serrotta). While that founding crew came from an established operation, here they had to figure out where to put things, get power to them, and create their own processes that would make No.22 unique. (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/long-road-to-nahbs-2020-teaser-interview-w-mike-smith-of-no-22-bicycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Read our interview with Mike</a> for a deeper dive on their origin story)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-02-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-02-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - factory floor.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-02-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-02-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-02-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-02-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-02-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It started with just five people, in a smaller part of this space, and everyone was basically in the same room. They kept everything close so they didn’t have to walk all the way across the building. But as they’ve grown, things have spread out and more machines were added.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-03-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-03-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - machined dropouts.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-03-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-03-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-03-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-03-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-03-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-02-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-02-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - 3d printed dropouts.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-02-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-02-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-02-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-02-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-frame-design-02-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, they do everything in house except the 3D printing of their stem and dropouts, those are done at Silca.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shown above are earlier machined dropouts (left), but they’ve switched to 3D printed parts (right) to get more consistent (and perfect) alignment between brake caliper mounts and the thru axle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-54-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1867\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-54-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - reamer drill press.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-54-jpg.webp 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-54-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-54-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-54-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-machine-shop-54-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During COVID, they couldn’t come in and work as a team, so they used that downtime to move the heavy machinery, paint the entire interior and add more, brighter lighting.

Which meant every tube was from a different batch, which meant they anodized differently, which was a challenge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, they’re ordering six months or more worth of tubing, and making more bikes. It’s still a relatively small number – at Serrotta, they were making 12 frames a day. Here, they make four a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Skipping Ahead to Paint &amp; Anodizing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-03-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-03-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - various anodized frames.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-03-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-03-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-03-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-03-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-03-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While we’re on production volume, they noted that they used to produce more bikes per week, but have slowed down a little since moving all finishing in-house. Before, they would outsource it, but the quality and consistency of the work wasn’t always what they wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-07-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-07-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - details of cerakoted and anodized frame.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-07-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-07-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-07-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-07-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-07-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>No.22 can mix and match Cerakote and anodizing for truly unique finishes.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So they brought it in-house, and now do all anodizing and Cerakote painting on site. That gives them full control, but takes longer. But that control is important because Cerakote is laid directly on the titanium with no base coat or primer, so it’ll show any imperfections in the tube, so they have to polish and finish all tubes and welds to absolute perfection first.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-57-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-57-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - sand blasting booth for matte finish.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-57-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-57-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-57-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-57-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-57-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Media blasting booths let them give some frames (or parts of frames) a matte finish, while others (or other parts) are polished for a high gloss finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-58-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-58-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - paint mixing room.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-58-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-58-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-58-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-58-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-58-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cerakote comes in a wide variety of colors, and they’re all mixed and prepped on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-56-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-56-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - paint booth with fork being sprayed.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-56-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-56-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-56-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-56-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-paint-56-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Have you ever seen such a clean, white paint booth?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They stopped doing wet paint, because Cerakote is better, lighter, more durable, and cleaner to use.

They take the order and then they or Scott do the design based on the fit numbers. Scott reviews every one, and he’s got years of experience coming from fit training and design at Serotta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their top tubes are mostly level, but they’ll make small tweaks to the top tube’s slope to get a seatpost logo a few mm above the collar. It’s a purely aesthetic effort, but details matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer order sheets have all the numbers, then it goes to production. They don’t do frame drawings anymore, it’s all done by number, and it’s color coded by fixture so it’s easy to efficiently run it through the system. They have machines and fixtures for most steps so that it can move through quickly without requiring a lot of extra setup steps between different tubes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-00-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-00-jpg.webp\" alt=\"no22 bicycles factory tour - anodizing booth.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-00-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-00-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-00-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-00-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/no22-factory-tour-anodizing-00-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aurora and Reactor have a carbon seat tube and mast, and they make that with an adjustable insert rather than make the bike with a full seat tube then cut it out, saving tubing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every tube is checked for the “high side”, because they’re not straight, so they have the high side pointing straight into the inside of the front triangle, which keeps the tubes aligned. Without this, it could make the frame “lean” left or right and nearly impossible to make perfect.
