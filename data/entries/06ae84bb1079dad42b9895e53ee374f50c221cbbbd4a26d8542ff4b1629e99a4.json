This “super Mercury,” which orbits its star once every 7.7 hours, was first discovered by NASA’s <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/earth-sized-exoplanet-has-everything-it-needs-for-lots-of-volcanoes/\">TESS</a> planet hunter in 2015. Now, scientists from the University of Turin in Italy and the Thüringer Landessternwarte in Germany have examined more recent measurements of the planet using ESO’s <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps.html\">HARPS spectrograph</a> along with the original TESS observations. They found that this object is almost twice as dense as Earth—which suggests it is most likely made of solid iron.</p>\n<p>Even though GJ 367b is now a solid iron planet, it might have once been the core of an ancient rocky planet.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976025#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976025&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"06ae84bb1079dad42b9895e53ee374f50c221cbbbd4a26d8542ff4b1629e99a4","category":"Tech"}
