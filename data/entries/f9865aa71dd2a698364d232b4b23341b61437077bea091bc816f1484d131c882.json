For example, he was the first source to reveal that iPhone 16 Pro models would feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1857208745014776215\">social media post</a> last week, Young said the latest quantum-dot display films have equal to better color gamut support, and offer improved motion performance, compared to the KSF phosphor film that he said Apple uses for the existing Pro Display XDR and previous MacBook Pro models. This means the Pro Display XDR 2 could have improved color accuracy and faster response times compared to the current model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released the Pro Display XDR in 2019, alongside an updated Mac Pro, and the external monitor has not received any hardware upgrades since then. The high-end 32-inch monitor features an LCD panel with LED backlighting, 6K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 1,600 nits of brightness, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the monitor starts at $4,999, but the optional Pro Stand costs $999 extra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working on an updated version of the Pro Display XDR <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/\">with an Apple silicon chip</a>, something the current model lacks. In the Studio Display, an A13 Bionic chip powers features such as Center Stage camera framing, spatial audio, and Siri voice commands. Additional features that customers are hoping for include a built-in camera, speakers, and a higher refresh rate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt this point, it is unclear when Apple might release a Pro Display XDR 2.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/pro-display-xdr-2-quantom-dot-rumor/\">Pro Display XDR 2 Expected to Feature Quantum-Dot Technology</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pro-display-xdr-2-expected-to-feature-quantum-dot-technology.2443442/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f9865aa71dd2a698364d232b4b23341b61437077bea091bc816f1484d131c882","category":"Apple"}
