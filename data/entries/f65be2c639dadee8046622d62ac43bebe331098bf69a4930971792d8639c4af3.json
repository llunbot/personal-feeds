The idea behind the plan was said to be to keep people within the Facebook ecosystem, and off of rival texting apps like Apple's iMessage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, according to an <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/654906392080948\">updated Instagram support page</a>, beginning in mid-December the following cross-app communication features will no longer be available to Instagram users:\r<br />\n<blockquote><ul><li>You won't be able to start new conversations or calls with Facebook accounts from Instagram.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Any existing chats on Instagram that you've had with Facebook accounts will become read-only, even if these Facebook accounts are removed from the chat. This means that you and others with Instagram accounts can't send new messages in these chats.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Facebook accounts won't be able to view your Activity Status or whether you've seen a message.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Any existing chats you've had with Facebook accounts won't move to your inbox on Facebook or Messenger.</li></ul></blockquote>When cross-app chat ends, Instagram users will need to start a new chat on Messenger or Facebook from their Facebook account to continue conversations with Facebook accounts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeta offered no reason for the change, but <em><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/12/04/instagram-facebook-messenger-chats-disconnected/\">9to5Google</a></em> speculates that it could be part of a larger effort to comply with Europe's Digital Markets Act (DMA). The theory is that Meta could be preparing to introduce wider interoperability between Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, which would fulfill a key requirement of the DMA. Either that or it is simply scaling back Messenger once again â€“ the company recently removed SMS/MMS support on Android and has shut down Messenger Lite.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook-messenger/\">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/instagram-messenger-chats-disconnecting/\">Instagram and Facebook Messenger Chats to Disconnect This Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-and-facebook-messenger-chats-to-disconnect-this-month.2412848/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f65be2c639dadee8046622d62ac43bebe331098bf69a4930971792d8639c4af3","category":"Apple"}
