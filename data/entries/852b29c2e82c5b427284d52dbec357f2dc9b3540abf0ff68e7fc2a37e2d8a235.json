It’s no secret that lots of great websites and\npublications have gone under over the past few years as the open\nweb falls apart, and it’s clear that directly supporting the\ncreators you love is a big part of how everyone gets to stay\nworking on the modern internet.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, we didn’t want to simply paywall the entire site — it’s a tragedy that traditional journalism is retreating behind\npaywalls while nonsense spreads across platforms for free. We also\nthink our big, popular homepage is a resource worth investing in.\nSo we’re rethinking The Verge in a freemium model: our homepage,\ncore news posts, Decoder interview transcripts, Quick Posts,\nStorystreams, and live blogs will remain free. We know so many of\nyou depend on us to curate the news every day, and we’re going to\nstay focused on making a great homepage that’s worth checking out\nregularly, whether you pay us or not.</p>\n\n<p>Our original reporting, reviews, and features will be behind a\ndynamic metered paywall — many of you will never hit the paywall,\nbut if you read us a lot, we’ll ask you to pay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like an extremely well-considered balance between keeping much of the site open to all, allowing metered access to a limited number of premium articles free of charge, and creating a new sustainable revenue stream from subscribers. Bravo.</p>\n\n<p>Count me in as a day one subscriber.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/03/the-verge-launches-a-subscription\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"852b29c2e82c5b427284d52dbec357f2dc9b3540abf0ff68e7fc2a37e2d8a235","category":"Tech"}
