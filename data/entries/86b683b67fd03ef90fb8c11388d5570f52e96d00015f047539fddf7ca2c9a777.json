In his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-11/will-there-be-a-cheaper-apple-vision-how-apple-can-lower-cost-of-new-headset-lirfnvz1\">Power On newsletter</a> today, Gurman said he expects the updated laptops to be released in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Purple.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nThe current 13-inch MacBook Air was announced in June 2022, while the 15-inch model was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-new-15-inch-macbook-air/\">introduced last week</a>. Both models are currently powered by the M2 chip, manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm process. The M3 chip is expected to be built on TSMC's 3nm process, resulting in significant performance and power efficiency improvements. Gurman said the M3 chip should have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the M2 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPriced starting at $1,299, the 15-inch MacBook Air's primary differences compared to the 13-inch model are a larger display and six speakers instead of four. Apple says the laptops have equal battery life, and they share the same overall design.

He expects the new iMac to launch by early next year with a similar design as the current model from 2020, which still has an M1 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air can be ordered now and launches this Tuesday.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/11/gurman-15-inch-macbook-air-with-m3-chip/\">Gurman: Apple Already Working on 15-Inch MacBook Air With M3 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-already-working-on-15-inch-macbook-air-with-m3-chip.2392534/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"86b683b67fd03ef90fb8c11388d5570f52e96d00015f047539fddf7ca2c9a777","category":"Apple"}
