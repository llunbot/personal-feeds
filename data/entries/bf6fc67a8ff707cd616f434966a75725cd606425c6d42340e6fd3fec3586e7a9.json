The <a href=\"https://donoharmmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025.03.05-Doc-1-Complaint.pdf\">complaint</a> argues the program is illegal because it is not open to white and Asian students. Around two weeks later, Do No Harm also <a href=\"https://donoharmmedicine.org/case/do-no-harm-v-university-of-pennsylvania-et-al/\">sued the University of Pennsylvania</a> for its partnership with a database called the <a href=\"https://phillyblackdoctors.com/\">Black Doctors Directory</a>, which allows patients to find Black physicians.</p>\n<p>The lawsuits join a recent uptick in legal action against universities, departments, and professional societies that host programs intended to increase diversity across academia, including in the sciences. In May 2024, for example, White students at the University of Oklahoma <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/university-oklahoma-anti-white-discrimination-lawsuit-rcna152644\">sued their school</a>, alleging the university discriminated against them by factoring in race when determining financial aid. In August, a conservative activist group <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/education-department-sued-mcnair-grants-race/725810/\">sued the Department of Education</a> over the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program, which provides mentoring and research support to underrepresented students pursuing doctoral degrees. Those cases followed the Supreme Court’s 2023 <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf\">decision</a> against factoring in race when considering college admissions, effectively striking down affirmative action.</p>\n<p>“What's happened here is the organizations bringing these lawsuits, they're capitalizing on the fact that the US Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions,” said Vinay Harpalani, a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law and an expert on affirmative action policies.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/anti-diversity-lawsuits-likely-to-hurt-the-scientific-community-say-scholars/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/anti-diversity-lawsuits-likely-to-hurt-the-scientific-community-say-scholars/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Claudia López Lloreda, Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bf6fc67a8ff707cd616f434966a75725cd606425c6d42340e6fd3fec3586e7a9","category":"Tech"}
