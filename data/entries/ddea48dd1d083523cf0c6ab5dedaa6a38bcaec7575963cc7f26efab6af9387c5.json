{"title":"David Pierce Reviews Humane’s AI Pin: ‘Nope. Nuh-Uh. No Way.’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review","date":1712885514000,"content":"\n<p>David Pierce, mincing no words at The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That raises the second question: should you buy this thing? That \none’s easy. Nope. Nuh-uh. No way. The AI Pin is an interesting \nidea that is so thoroughly unfinished and so totally broken in so \nmany unacceptable ways that I can’t think of anyone to whom I’d \nrecommend spending the $699 for the device and the $24 monthly \nsubscription. [...] </p>\n\n<p>As the overall state of AI improves, the AI Pin will probably get \nbetter, and I’m bullish on AI’s long-term ability to do a lot of \nfiddly things on our behalf. But there are too many basic things \nit can’t do, too many things it doesn’t do well enough, and too \nmany things it does well but only sometimes that I’m hard-pressed \nto name a single thing it’s genuinely good at. None of this — not \nthe hardware, not the software, not even GPT-4 — is ready yet. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ever since Humane de-stealthed and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/02/humane-ai-pin\">revealed the AI Pin last July</a>, the big question (for me at least) has been whether it’d actually be useful to own a gadget that does what the AI Pin is supposed to do. It’s seemed to me all along that almost everything the AI Pin does would be just as well, if not better, done by a phone with an LLM-powered voice assistant. But Humane has far bigger problems, because the AI Pin clearly doesn’t even do what it’s supposed to. Pierce:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’d estimate that half the time I tried to call someone, it simply \ndidn’t call. Half the time someone called me, the AI Pin would \nkick it straight to voicemail without even ringing. After many \ndays of testing, the one and only thing I can truly rely on the AI \nPin to do is tell me the time. </p>\n\n<p>The one and only thing I can truly rely on the AI Pin to do is \ntell me the time The more I tested the AI Pin, the more it felt \nlike the device was trying to do an awful lot and the hardware \nsimply couldn’t keep up. For one, it’s pretty much constantly \nwarm. In my testing, it never got truly painfully hot, but after \neven a few minutes of using it, I could feel the battery like a \nhand warmer against my skin. Bongiorno says the warmth can come \nfrom overuse or when you have a bad signal and that the device is \naggressive about shutting down when it gets too hot. I’ve noticed: \nI use the AI Pin for more than a couple of minutes, and I get \nnotified that it has overheated and needs to cool down. This \nhappened a lot in my testing (including on a spring weekend in DC \nand in 40-degree New York City, where it was the only warm thing \nin sight). </p>\n\n<p>The battery life is similarly rough. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pierce’s review is so brutal it’s uncomfortable at times. I don’t know where Humane goes from here but this might be impossible to recover from reputationally. It seems borderline criminal that they shipped it in this state. Here’s one more tidbit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Me: “Play ‘Texas Hold ’Em’ by Beyoncé.” </p>\n\n<p>The AI Pin: “Songs not found for request: Play Texas Hold ’Em by \nBeyonc\\u00e9. Try again using your actions find a relevant track, \nalbum, artist, or playlist; Create a new PlayMusic action with at \nleast one of the slots filled in. If you find a relevant track or \nalbum play it, avoid asking for clarification or what they want \nto hear.” </p>\n\n<p>That’s a real exchange I had, multiple times, over multiple days \nwith the AI Pin. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I thought perhaps the “<code>\\u00e9</code>” thing was a CMS glitch, but no — <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w1vv7_dU2Y\">watch Pierce’s corresponding video review</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_w1vv7_dU2Y?si=DK4DXrNwHa-j5QHt&amp;t=66\">you’ll hear</a> the AI Pin pronounce “Beyoncé” as “<em>beeyonk-backslash-you-zero-zero-ee-nine</em>”.</p>\n\n<p>(Yet, somehow, the AI Pin garnered a 4/10 on The Verge’s review scale. How bad, how broken, would a product experience have to be to get a lower score? Would the reviewer need to be electrocuted by the device to rate it lower? “<em>3/10, sent me to the ER with a nasty burn</em>”? “<em>1/10, it killed my spouse when she tried it</em>”?)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/11/pierce-humane-ai-pin\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ddea48dd1d083523cf0c6ab5dedaa6a38bcaec7575963cc7f26efab6af9387c5","category":"Tech"}
