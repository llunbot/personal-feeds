Prior to 2022, the volume slider was a familiar presence on the Lock Screen whenever media was playing. When Apple released iOS 16, however, it removed the control without explaining the reason.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThankfully, Apple has brought back the control as an option in iOS 18.2. If you've updated your device, you'll find a toggle in <strong>Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Audio &amp; Visual</strong>, labeled <strong>Always Show Volume Control</strong>. Enable the switch, and you'll be able to adjust volume from the Lock Screen without having to unlock your iPhone or use the physical volume buttons.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-volume-control-lock-screen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2898\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\nElsewhere in iOS 18.2, provided you have a compatible device, you will find several Apple Intelligence features, including Image Playground and Genmoji.
