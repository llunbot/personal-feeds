He suggested those files comprised HTTP archive, or HAR, files, which company support personnel use to replicate customer browser activity during troubleshooting sessions.</p>\n<p>“HAR files can also contain sensitive data, including cookies and session tokens, that malicious actors can use to impersonate valid users,” Bradbury wrote. “Okta has worked with impacted customers to investigate, and has taken measures to protect our customers, including the revocation of embedded session tokens. In general, Okta recommends sanitizing all credentials and cookies/session tokens within a HAR file before sharing it.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977688#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977688&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ebe766283f071ae6643ae8204909ec8569332b415dfea901be3af136fc27cec","category":"Tech"}
