The existing contract was set to expire at 12 am ET today, but the companies agreed to a short extension that prevents a blackout for now.</p>\n<p>\"NBCUniversal and YouTube TV have agreed to a short extension while parties continue talks. NBCUniversal will not go dark on YouTube TV at midnight eastern tonight,\" NBC said in a statement provided to Ars last night.</p>\n<p>NBC declined to say how long the extension is, and YouTube TV owner Google did not comment. About 15 NBC-owned channels and eight regional NBC Sports networks could still go dark on YouTube TV if the companies don't agree on terms before the extension expires.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799978#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799978&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"963df1c093d581d6240d3d19d0c1966488eb45faf37e4baaf42bc710f3d0aee8","category":"Tech"}
