That’s Tadej Pogačar’s record at Milan-San Remo so far, with that 12th in 2020, a few weeks before he won his first Tour de France. Pogačar is on a quest to win it all, Grand Tours and Monuments, to solidify himself as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\" target=\"_blank\">greatest of all time</a>. His commitment to ride the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\" target=\"_blank\">Giro</a> may prevent him from going all in on the Poggio descent, as once he’s ticked that off he won’t need to go back, but the same applies here and he just needs to lay it all on the line once, take the risk and get the job done. He’s capable of it, he wants it, but it won’t be easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His odds range from 3/1 to 6/1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mads Pedersen</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07121526/mads_pedersen_qa-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"mads pedersen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07121526/mads_pedersen_qa-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07121526/mads_pedersen_qa-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07121526/mads_pedersen_qa-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07121526/mads_pedersen_qa-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07121526/mads_pedersen_qa-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/07121526/mads_pedersen_qa.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Sean Hardy</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Pogačar is trying to win the race, Mads Pedersen is one of only a few sprinters capable of winning the Sprinter’s Classic. The Dane is absolutely capable of sticking at the front over the Poggio and there’s no doubt he’ll have one of the strongest kicks of whoever he comes to the Via Roma with. If we’re playing a game of who wants it most, Pedersen’s desire to win a Monument would have him at the top, but would he prefer to save himself for Flanders and Roubaix? Potentially. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He sits between 5/1 and 12/1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Christophe Laporte</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/wout-van-aert-christophe-laporte-gent-wevelgem-jumbo-visma-2023.jpeg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Visma-Lease a Bike</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Christophe Laporte is more than a domestique, but Wout van Aert sitting out San Remo leaves the door open for the Frenchman to seize the opportunity to win a Monument, and those opportunities won’t come around often. You can guarantee he gets his best ever result in the race, with his highest placing 13th, but you’d have thought he’d struggle to go solo coming off the Poggio. That being said, he has as good a chance as anyone from a small group sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s between 11/1 and 19/1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Filippo Ganna</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"milan-san remo podium 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Milan-San-Remo-2024-podium-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Milan-San Remo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Filippo Ganna has <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/filippo-ganna-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">his enormous Hour record</a> he can focus on winning road races. That’s a scary thought for everyone else in the peloton. Now Ineos Grenadiers are a certified Classics machine rather than one big Tour de France train they’ve got the resources to get Ganna big wins. He was second last year, with a bigger kick after 300km than Van Aert and Pogačar, so his odds for this are astonishingly long. It’s also his home race, that counts for something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s between 7/1 and 20/1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outside bets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Matej Mohorič after Strade Bianche\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Strade-Bianche-Race-Gallery-051-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course there are more than five contenders, and it’s not always favourites that win – as demonstrated in recent years by Jasper Stuyven and Matej Mohorič.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Mohorič, his odds aren’t dissimilar to Ganna’s, and there are only about two people in the race capable of descending like he did in 2022. One of those is Søren Kragh Andersen, but given he’s a teammate of Van der Poel he’ll be lucky to get his shot. His odds are longer than their other teammate Jasper Philipsen, who would be the favourite if somehow it did come to a bunch sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other sprinters who could do the job are Biniam Girmay, Caleb Ewan and Jonathan Milan – that’s written in the stars at some point surely?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And descenders to keep an eye on include Julian Alaphilippe and the Ineos pair of former winner Michał Kwiatkowski and Leeds’ own Tom Pidcock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other riders the bookies reckon have a good shot are Remco Evenepoel and Arnaud De Lie, who aren’t even going to be racing on the day, so maybe don’t listen to everything they say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stayed tuned later this week for the <em>Cyclist</em> team’s predictions</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For more of our Classics coverage visit <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">our Classics hub</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/milan-san-remo-preview-favourites\">Who are the favourites for Milan-San Remo 2024?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cd93608a757486597f89a24e7e4c9d9b5304596f574a7f73327bf129cf493da1","category":"Cycling"}
