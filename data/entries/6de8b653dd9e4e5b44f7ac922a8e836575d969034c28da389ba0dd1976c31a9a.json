Many of its customers are riding bikes that are several years old, dating back to the early days of the brand with many owners on bikes that are 7 or 8 years old and still going strong.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-46.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The frames are designed to be tough enough to last indefinitely but to be repairable and refurbishable. Starling offers its warranty to all customers, covering manufacturing failures and also a crash-repair service and frame repair, repaint and refurbishment services.</p>\n<p>Should a frame fail or be damaged, it can often be repaired in-house and returned to the customer in nearly good-as-new condition. Frames can also be refurbished, repainted and often upgraded to keep them running beautifully year after year. Because the frames are steel, almost all damage can be repaired rather than the whole frame being scrapped.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Starling-Swoop-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The warranty will now cover customers for seven years, applying to original owners.
