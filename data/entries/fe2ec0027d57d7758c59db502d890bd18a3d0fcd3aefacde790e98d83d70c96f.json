The six-core chip is clocked at 3.78 GHz, which matches the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> version, but with a key distinction—a five-core GPU, which is one core less than the version found in the ‌iPhone‌. This suggests that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/\">iPad mini 7</a>'s A17 Pro chip is likely a \"binned\" version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌iPad mini‌'s Geekbench scores reveal a range between 2,710 and 2,840 in single-core performance and 6,274 to 6,982 in multi-core performance, positioning it slightly below the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro in both metrics. For comparison, the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro's A17 Pro typically scores around 2,888 in single-core and 7,169 in multi-core tests. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNonetheless, the benchmarks confirm that the new ‌iPad mini‌ offers a substantial performance upgrade over its predecessor. The sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ from 2021 achieved approximate single-core scores of 2,121 and multi-core scores of 5,367. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n  <tr>\r<br />\n    <th></th>\r<br />\n    <th>Chip</th>\r<br />\n    <th>GPU cores</th>\r<br />\n    <th>Memory</th>\r<br />\n    <th>Single-Core CPU Score</th>\r<br />\n    <th>Multi-Core CPU Score</th>\r<br />\n  <th>Metal GPU Score</th>\r<br />\n  </tr>\r<br />\n  <tr>\r<br />\n    <th>‌iPad mini‌ 6 (2021)</th>\r<br />\n    <td>A15 Bionic</td>\r<br />\n    <td>5</td>\r<br />\n    <td>4GB</td>\r<br />\n    <td>2,121</td>\r<br />\n    <td>5,367</td>\r<br />\n    <td>19,486</td>\r<br />\n  </tr>\r<br />\n  <tr>\r<br />\n    <th>‌iPad mini 7‌ (2024) </th>\r<br />\n    <td>A17 Pro</td>\r<br />\n    <td>5</td>\r<br />\n    <td>8GB</td>\r<br />\n    <td>2,840</td>\r<br />\n    <td>6,982</td>\r<br />\n<td>25,895</td>\r<br />\n  </tr>\r<br />\n  <tr>\r<br />\n    <th>‌iPhone 15‌ Pro (2023)</th>\r<br />\n    <td>A17 Pro</td>\r<br />\n    <td>6</td>\r<br />\n    <td>8GB</td>\r<br />\n    <td>2,888</td>\r<br />\n    <td>7,169</td>\r<br />\n  <td>27,144</td>\r<br />\n  </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Geekbench listings also confirm the seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌'s adoption of 8GB of memory. While this was expected due to Apple Intelligence's 8GB memory, it was not actually known until now. The previous-generation ‌iPad mini‌ featured just 4GB of memory, marking a substantial upgrade on the latest device.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/ipad-mini-7-benchmarks-confirm-8gb-ram/\">iPad Mini 7 Benchmarks Confirm 8GB RAM, 5-Core GPU's Slower Speeds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-7-benchmarks-confirm-8gb-ram-5-core-gpus-slower-speeds.2440393/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fe2ec0027d57d7758c59db502d890bd18a3d0fcd3aefacde790e98d83d70c96f","category":"Apple"}
