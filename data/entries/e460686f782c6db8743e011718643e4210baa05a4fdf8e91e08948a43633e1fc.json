As <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2177439/next-gen-carplay-cars-porsche-aston-martin-2024.html\">reported by <em>Car and Driver</em> magazine</a>, the luxury carmakers previewed a custom CarPlay system for future car models. Over a year later, we still don’t know when they’re going to start rolling off the lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Porsche has <a href=\"https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-communication-management-change-of-the-model-year-38985.html\">announced</a> an updated Porsche Communication Management system for its 2026 911, Taycan, Panamera, and Cayenne model series, and Apple’s next-gen CarPlay is nowhere to be found. Porsche describes the system as “more responsive” and smarter, including built-in support for Amazon’s Alexa assistant. Similar to CarPlay, which is still supported, the Porsche Communication Management system also offers “direct access to a large number of apps from different categories.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the press release doesn’t specifically call out next-gen CarPlay, it’s clear that Porsche’s new system isn’t the one described by <em>Car and Driver</em>. That design features “background wallpaper that mimics the brand’s distinct houndstooth (or Pepita in Porsche-speak) seat pattern.” The system described here is for infotainment rather than a full dashboard takeover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next generation of CarPlay, as Apple describes it, “ensures a cohesive design experience that is the very best of your car and your iPhone — with designs for each automaker that express your vehicle’s character and brand.” It will control vehicle functions like air conditioning and radio and offer full personalization options for each manufacturer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has yet to officially announce any partnerships for next-gen CarPlay.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e460686f782c6db8743e011718643e4210baa05a4fdf8e91e08948a43633e1fc","category":"Apple"}
