The team at Specialized looked to create a tire that can perform for longer miles, on rougher roads, in bad weather, and roll on dirt and gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up--800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Mondo Tire tread close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up--800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-tread-close-up-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why not update the Specialized Armadillo? </strong>The tire is arguably one of the most well know endurance and trusted puncture-protective, higher-level performance tires around. Well — the team at Specialized decided that puncture protection and long tread life aren’t enough; riders now require a higher level of performance along with the aforementioned. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-05.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus — when it comes to race day, they don’t want to change out their well-known training tires for ones that aren’t second nature to them. Basically, a tire that will go anywhere, do anything, no “splitting the difference,” just performance and reliability… easy right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mondo Performance </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling--800x448.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Mondo Tire CRR Rolling\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling--800x448.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling--297x166.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling--120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling--768x430.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling--400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-CRR-Rolling-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The S-Works Mondo tires have 11% less rolling resistance than the previous class-leading Specialized tire. Like most gains in tire performance, a secret compound is involved, Specialized proprietary Gription. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compound-diefference-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compound-diefference--800x404.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Mondo Tire compound diefference\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compound-diefference--800x404.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compound-diefference--297x150.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compound-diefference--120x61.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compound-diefference--768x388.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compound-diefference-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Gripton compounds run on a scale from ultra-efficient and durable T2 road compounds to the super tacky T9 mountain compound — T5 lands right in the middle as a balanced mix. Most successful Specialized tires employ a mix of the two for efficiency and traction.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds--800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Mondo Tire compounds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds--800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-compounds-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Mondo, the design team used the dual compound featuring T2 in the center, flanked by the wet and dry grip of the T5 compound on the shoulders. This is the same dual compound that debuted in a World Road Championship, the Specialized Turbo race tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx--800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Mondo Tire SD-Worx\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx--800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx--297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx--120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx--768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx--400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx--1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-SD-Worx-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The formulation uses a mix of activated Silica and Specialized T2 Gripton, delivering a lively, fast tire, 17% faster than the Specialized T5 compound on in-house rolling resistance test drum tests. For corning grip, the team used the softer activated Silica T5 Gripton compound (which offers 10% more grip than the T2 compound). This compound change allows the Mondo to sink into the road, providing a planted feeling for cornering speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Best Puncture Protection</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"3rd Paris-Roubaix Femmes (1.WWT) One day race: Denain - Roubaix (145.4km)\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Moto.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Saturday April 08 2023\n3rd Paris-Roubaix Femmes (1.WWT) One day race: Denain – Roubaix (145.4km)\n\nPhoto: Eloise Mavian / Tornanti.cc</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackbelt protection is a common feature on Speclizeds endurance tires. For the Mondo, the tire team updated the protection belt, giving it a dense, strong cross-woven aramid material that delivers 12% more puncture protection than the previous Blackbelt offerings. Just to add a little extra, the team added a new Grid Race protection similar to that on its mountain bike tires.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Details-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Details--800x540.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Mondo Tire Details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Details--800x540.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Details--297x201.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Details--120x81.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Details--768x519.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-Details-.jpeg 1091w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This dual layer of cross-woven polyamide panels is applied at the side wall, and despite its supple and flexible nature, its high tear strength mates incredible durability with a stable, confident ride at low tire pressures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why different materials on the breaker and the side wall?</strong> Specialized explains: <em>“It’s because each part of the tire plays a different role in creating the tire’s overall performance. There are hundreds of materials to choose from, and 0.5 mm of too much material, or the wrong material in the wrong place, can destroy a tire’s ride quality or make it vulnerable to flats. Blackbelt, under the tread, must be dense and strong to avoid punctures.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win--800x534.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win--800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Tire-BWR-win-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Does added protection mean additional weight? The</strong> S-Works Mondo is 5% lighter than the nearest endurance competition. It runs on a supple 120 TPI casing and tubeless-ready construction, making the Mondo tire a great mix of function and fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Mondo is hookless ready, and Specliazed claims it’s strong enough for pressures on hooked rims higher than any hookless rims can reach. This is all to ensure riders have the flexibility to run the pressure they feel is right when using hooked rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We received an early sample of the S-Works Mondo tire in the 700c x 32mm size. The only bike/wheel combination Zach had that would fit the tires was his Why PR currently fitted with Bontrager Aeolus RSL 62 wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Mondo-Endurance-road-tire-32-Romin-EVO-3d-Printed-saddle-seat-13.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is built with a Whisky carbon road fork, both of which list their tire clearance as 700c x 32mm.
