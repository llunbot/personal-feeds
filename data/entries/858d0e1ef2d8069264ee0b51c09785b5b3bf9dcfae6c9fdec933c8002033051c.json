Originally released in August 1981, this computer became so popular and long-lived that competitors reverse-engineered its BIOS so that their computers could use the same software and peripherals, a practice that eventually resulted in a de facto standard whose descendants we still use today.</p>\n<p>If you want to experience what using an old IBM PC was like, you could drop a few hundred dollars on a used one on eBay. Or you could roll the dice on this new oddball laptop on AliExpress. The \"<a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805342629426.html\">Book 8088</a>\" laptop PC combines modern components with an Intel 8088 processor and 640KB (yes, that's kilobytes) of memory. A few more modern amenities make it nicer to use than a 40-year-old desktop, like a 640Ã—200 16-color LCD screen, and built-in interfaces that allow USB accessories and CompactFlash cards to interface with the ancient components (a 512MB CompactFlash card serves as the system's hard drive).</p>\n<p>Intel's 8088 was a cut-down version of the original 8086 with an 8-bit data bus; in the Book 8088 and the IBM PC, it runs at a clock speed of 4.77 MHz. That slow speed and low memory limit means it's best suited to MS-DOS, with its text-based interface and general lack of multitasking support. You <em>can</em> run very early Windows versions on it, up to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0\">version 3.0</a> but, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytbyMSyg09U\">according to retro-tech YouTube</a>, it seems like a bad time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940475#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940475&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"858d0e1ef2d8069264ee0b51c09785b5b3bf9dcfae6c9fdec933c8002033051c","category":"Tech"}
