And how did\nthey land in China?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://grubermotors.com/\">Gruber Motors</a>, the shop brokering the deal, performed some\ndetective work to figure it out. It was discovered that the three\nRoadsters were all intended to be dismantled by an early Tesla\ncompetitor — test mules in last decade’s international EV race.\nAnd now, someone has submitted a $2 million bid in hopes of adding\nthem to their collection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First time I’ve had reason to actually link to Gruber Motors.
