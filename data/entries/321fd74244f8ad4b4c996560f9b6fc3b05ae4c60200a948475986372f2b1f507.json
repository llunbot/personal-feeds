The defendants, known only by their IP addresses so far, allegedly \"engaged in widespread unlawful scraping of data from Twitter\" by \"flooding Twitter's sign-up page with automated requests.\"</p>\n<p>\"The volume of these requests far exceeded what any single individual could send to a server in a given period and clearly indicated that these automated requests were aimed at scraping data from Twitter. These requests have severely taxed X Corp.'s servers and impaired the user experience for millions of X Corp.'s customers,\" the lawsuit alleged.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elonmuskdallaslawsuit.pdf\">lawsuit</a>, which seeks damages of at least $1 million, was filed last week in Dallas County District Court and <a href=\"https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/elon-musks-x-corp-files-lawsuit-against-four-unknown-dallas-residents-data-scraping-twitter/287-d30d1cb0-3dbf-43e6-aae7-d9b437475183\">reported yesterday</a> by the Dallas-based station WFAA.
