The C2 and the 2021 iPad Pro are previous-generation models that still offer great performance and display quality. Apple’s entry-level 2023 Mac mini and AirPods Pro also returned to the lowest prices we've tracked for them, at $400 for the mini and $200 for the AirPods Pro.</p>\n<h3>Apple iPad Pro (2021) 12.9-inch M1 Wi-Fi + cellular, 256GB for <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cjyBdyFpMip\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$1,000</strong></a> ($1,400)</h3>\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/2021-ipad-pro-review-more-of-the-same-but-way-way-faster-thanks-to-m1/\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed</a> the 2021 (fifth generation) iPad Pro, it was \"the best screen we've ever seen in a tablet [and] one of the best screens we've seen in any personal computing device, period.\" The Mini LED display alone could be a good reason to upgrade from previous-generation iPad Pros, particularly for avid consumers of HDR content. Apple's M1 processor took the 2021 iPad Pro to untouchable, \"peerless\" performance levels on a tablet that already led the market in performance, and the inclusion of Thunderbolt 3 connectivity sweetened the deal for productivity. You'll likely need a dongle to support heavier workflows since that's the only built-in port for charging and data transfer.</p>\n<p>The sixth-generation 2022 iPad Pro (the latest model) steps up to the newest M2 processor, but we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/2022-ipad-pro-review-fast-chip-great-screen-tough-sell/\">recommend</a> that those who already have a 2021 iPad Pro stick with what they have, making it a solid deal for new users. Especially with cellular capabilities and $400 off—the largest discount we've tracked on it—the 2021 iPad Pro is a great pickup. If you don't need that size or power, we think the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MjQB51\" target=\"_blank\">10.9-inch iPad Air</a> is the best choice <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/2022-ipad-air-review-m1-other-tablets-0/\" target=\"_blank\">for most buyers</a> seeking a new tablet, and it does so at nearly <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MjQB51\" target=\"_blank\">half the price</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932287#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932287&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"83a1c5ad800b9e88cd656414cf63f5145147e42c2b453a91bc2e042c4322065e","category":"Tech"}
