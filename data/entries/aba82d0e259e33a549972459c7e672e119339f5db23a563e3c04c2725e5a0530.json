{"title":"Bang & Olufsen Announces First Noise-Canceling True Wireless Earbuds","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/29/beoplay-eq-noise-canceling-earbuds/","date":1627546964000,"content":"Bang &amp; Olufsen today announced <a href=\"https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/earphones/beoplay-eq\">Beoplay EQ</a>, the Danish audio outfit's first true wireless headphones with adaptive active noise cancelation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/beoplay-eq-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTo achieve maximum noise cancelation, the buds use adaptive ANC that combines active noise cancellation with passive sealing. Six microphones allow for automatic adjustment of ANC levels and also make use of directional beamforming technology to improve call and speech quality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Beoplay EQ will retail for $399 (£349/€399), so they're $150 more expensive than Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, but apart from the premium look, they do pack some solid features, including 20 hours' battery life when used in conjunction with the charging case, and 6.5 hours of playtime with ANC turned on (versus ‌AirPods Pro‌'s 4.5 hours). They also include a fast charge feature, so 20 minutes in the aluminum case gets you two hours of playtime.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe compact case supports both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, while the buds themselves are more reminiscent of Beats Studio Buds than <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, with a small profile and an ergonomic fit. They're IP54 dust and water resistant, and come with interchangeable ear tips in different sizes. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/beoplay-eq.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWireless specs-wise, they support the aptX adaptive codec and the latest Bluetooth 5.2, and the set-up process is simplified on both Android and Apple devices thanks to the inclusion of Microsoft Swift Pair and Made for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> licenses.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBeoplay EQ come in Black Anthracite and Sand colors and will be available to purchase from August 19 via Bang &amp; Olufsen's <a href=\"https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/earphones/beoplay-eq\">website</a> and in Bang &amp; Olufsen retail stores. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bang-olufsen/\">Bang &amp; Olufsen</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/29/beoplay-eq-noise-canceling-earbuds/\">Bang &amp; Olufsen Announces First Noise-Canceling True Wireless Earbuds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bang-olufsen-announces-first-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds.2305871/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ROMPPl5R7aQ:HFO3nrZZ12M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ROMPPl5R7aQ:HFO3nrZZ12M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ROMPPl5R7aQ\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aba82d0e259e33a549972459c7e672e119339f5db23a563e3c04c2725e5a0530","category":"Apple"}
