To make matters much worse, customers allege they never signed up for OnStar Smart Driver in the first place, claiming the choice was made for them by salespeople during the car-buying process.</p>\n<p>Now, in what feels like an all-too-rare win for privacy in the 21st century, that data-sharing deal is no more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012276#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012276&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
