Instead, this tends to be the price range for people who’ve already spent some time on a mountain bike and have decided they want something a little more serious to take their riding to the next level.</p>\n<p>While budget is still a priority, the bikes in this price bracket are a little more trail-focused. So you can expect to find suspension that’s a bit more heavy-duty and equipment that’s better at handling the rigours of off-road riding.</p>\n<p>This price range is dominated by hardtails, but you can get a good full-suspension bike if you’re prepared to spend close to the £1,000 mark, and it’s not unheard of to see some full-sus bikes under £1,000 among the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">Hardtails</a> tend to be lighter and easier to maintain, but the benefit of having both front and rear suspension is that it’ll give you more confidence and traction on steep descents.</p>\n<p>The industry also seems to have settled in terms of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">wheel size</a>, meaning the majority of bikes at this price will now use <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">27.5in/650b wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>At this price point, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a> are becoming more common, introducing extra versatility to a bike and consequently opening up a far wider range of riding.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-brakes/\">Hydraulic disc brakes</a> are also almost standard at this price. We’d go nearly as far as saying you should avoid bikes that don’t have them, because they offer better and more confidence-inspiring performance than cable brakes.</p>\n<p>A good tip is to look for a bike at this price point that uses the Boost <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/mtb-axle-standards/\">mountain bike axle standard</a>. Upgrading wheels is an easy way to improve the performance of a bike and this standard will open up a whole plethora of lighter and stronger <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-wheels/\">mountain bike wheels</a> to you.</p>\n<p>Every machine here can be pushed into service at any trail centre, in most types of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">cross-country races</a> and for any sort of general off-road exploration.</p>\n<p>No matter which bike you choose in this price bracket, it is going to help get more out of you and your riding – which, after all, is why we ride bikes.</p>\n<h2>Best mountain bikes for around £1,000 in 2023, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Boardman MHT 8.9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"We dubbed Boardman's MHT 8.9 an instant classic when it arrived earlier this year.\" title=\"boardman-mht89-01-1534338647406-pgnpyig5ek7w-1537886266359-hlemk7kc43is-a9bb916\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We dubbed Boardman’s MHT 8.9 an instant classic when it first arrived.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,000 as tested</li>\n<li>A ride that performs far beyond what the price would suggest</li>\n<li>Great kit makes the most of the sorted frame</li>\n<li>Versatile frame means it can switch to commuting duties</li>\n</ul><p>If you’ve got £1,000 to spend on a quick trail hardtail then this absolutely has to be on your shortlist because its ride is capable of outclassing nearly everything else in its category.</p>\n<p>As a rework of Boardman’s fast trail 29er, the MHT is more evolution than revolution. It’s blisteringly fast, with a lot of that pace coming directly from the Boardman’s lack of overall weight. Pop it on the scales and you’d see it actually comes in at around 2kg lighter than most similarly priced bikes.</p>\n<p>Its understated alloy frame is paired with a very capable RockShox Reba RL fork, while a sorted Shimano SLX <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrain</a> with 46t crawler cog should see you up the steepest of inclines.</p>\n<p>The MHT can even lend itself to commuting duties thanks to its rack mounts, low overall weight and hardwearing tyres.</p>\n<p>It’s a different proposition from the full-suspension bikes you’ll find in this list, but if you like going quickly and don’t suffer from a bad back then it could be the smarter choice.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/boardman-mht-8-9-review/\">Read our full Boardman MHT 8.9 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals for the Boardman MHT 8.9</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Voodoo Bizango</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Voodoo Bizango hardtail trail mountain bike\" title=\"Voodoo Bizango - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Voodoo Bizango belies its price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£750 as tested</li>\n<li>Sorted geometry and good choice of components</li>\n<li>Could do with a dropper post</li>\n</ul><p>The Voodoo Bizango offers fantastic performance for its £750 price tag.

It’s also specced with a RockShox Recon RL fork with Motion Control damper.</p>\n<p>On the trail, the great geometry combines with the generous spec to form a bike that feels confident and composed on techy descents, riding predictably and demonstrating that a circa £900 bike needn’t be ridden conservatively.</p>\n<p>With a few spec changes, such as the tyres, the Line 29 will be just as handy riding XC as it is on the descents.

Even more astonishingly then, it not only achieved that goal, but for £850.</p>\n<p>How exactly has Halfords achieved it? Well, it’s certainly not the most refined-looking package, but this doesn’t affect performance on the trail, so we think that’s one compromise worth making.</p>\n<p>The geometry might not be as progressive as pricier options, but it’s by no means a throwback and it impresses on both climbs and descents.</p>\n<p>The dropper post is a big performance gain too, and while the handling over technical terrain isn’t the best available, there’s no getting past how good the kit is on this bike for the price.</p>\n<p>Our only major concern is that the three-size range won’t accommodate the smallest or tallest riders out there.

Just make sure the geometry suits you.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/vitus-sentier-27-review/\">Read our full Vitus Sentier 27 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Vitus Sentier 29</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"A light and dark blue hardtail Vitus Sentier 29 mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus Sentier 29\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> By combining well-chosen parts with balanced geometry, Vitus has created a fun and versatile bike in the Sentier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£850 as tested</li>\n<li>Great-performing, well-chosen spec for the price</li>\n<li>Good geometry and plenty of space make the bike comfortable on a wide range of terrain</li>\n<li>The fork might need upgrading as your abilities improve</li>\n</ul><p>The Sentier’s frame is fairly basic and doesn’t have full-length outer-gear cable routing – the inner gear cable is exposed under the top tube and seatstay. However, it does have internal dropper post cable routing for future upgrades.</p>\n<p>With a 10-speed Shimano Deore drivetrain that uses a SunRace cassette, Tektro brakes and WTB <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless-ready</a> wheels wrapped in Schwalbe tyres, it’s easy to forgive the Sentier for its lack of dropper post.</p>\n<p>The X-Fusion RC32 fork performs okay once it’s into its travel, but struggles with off-the-top suppleness. However, the headline 13.26kg weight makes this one of the lightest bikes in the sub-£1,000 category.</p>\n<p>The geometry isn’t as progressive as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/calibre-line-29-review/\">Calibre’s Line 29</a>, but still looks pretty good for a trail bike. The ride confirms this, with snappy handling making it fun to take sharp turns or just ride mellower trails.</p>\n<p>Going for a slightly larger size than recommended should improve handling if you’re looking to shred, but the Sentier is better suited to tamer trails.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/vitus-sentier-29-review/\">Read our full Vitus Sentier 29 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<section><div>\n        \n<h2>Have you found what you’re looking for? </h2>\n<p>If £1,000 is a bit too much money, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-750/\">the best mountain bikes under £750</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-500/\">the best mountain bikes under £500</a> still offer great performance and are ideal if you’re just starting out or buying for someone who is.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, if this list has whetted your appetite and you think you could stretch your budget a little further, check out our list of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-2000/\">the best mountain bikes under £2,000</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-3000/\">the best mountain bikes under £3,000</a>. </p>\n<p>Still need a bit more info to help you decide?
