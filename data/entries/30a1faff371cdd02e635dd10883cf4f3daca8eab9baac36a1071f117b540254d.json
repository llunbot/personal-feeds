Gemini Nano is able to provide instant insight to users about websites that might be risky, even if it's a scam that hasn't been seen before.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle says that Gemini Nano is able to distill the varied, complex nature of websites, making it quicker for Google to adapt to new scam tactics.
