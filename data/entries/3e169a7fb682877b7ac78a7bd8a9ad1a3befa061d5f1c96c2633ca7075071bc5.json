After Apple matched the donations, the original money was returned to the employees, and the matched money was kept. The employees also wrote off their fake charitable donations on their tax returns, earning them additional money.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBetween July 1, 2018 and April 6, 2021, the employees collected approximately $152,000 from Apple's program and overreported $100,000 in charitable contributions as tax deductions. Apple detected the fraud and brought it to the attention of the district attorney's office. From Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen:\r<br />\n<blockquote>This case underscores our unwavering commitment to rigorously prosecuting individuals who defraud the tech community and misuse vital charitable programs and state resources. We commend Apple for coming forward and actively collaborating with our Office to uncover this elaborate fraud. We encourage others in the tech community to do the same. It's the holidays. Give - legally - to help the needy, not to help yourself.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThe six former Apple employees who participated in the scheme have been charged with grand theft, conspiracy to commit felony grand theft, perjury, and tax fraud. Due to the amount of money involved, they face charges under California's aggravated white-collar crime enhancement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf convicted the six are facing jail time, fines, and fees, including restitution for the money they collected.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/apple-employees-charity-scam/\">Former Apple Employees Used Charity Scam to Steal Over $150,000</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/former-apple-employees-used-charity-scam-to-steal-over-150-000.2444725/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e169a7fb682877b7ac78a7bd8a9ad1a3befa061d5f1c96c2633ca7075071bc5","category":"Apple"}
