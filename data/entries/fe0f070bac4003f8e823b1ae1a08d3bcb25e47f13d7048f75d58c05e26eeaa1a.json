I know how much cycling means for Belgian people. I am not afraid, I am ready to make a positive contribution to the team’s future.’</p>\n<p>As a professional cyclist, Pridham completed eight editions of the Tour de France Féminin and two Giro Rosas.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10125/cbd-what-is-it-and-will-it-improve-cycling-performance\">CBD: What is it and will it improve cycling performance?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/tutorials/10159/things-we-wish-we-knew-when-we-started-cycling\">Things we wish we knew when we started cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/wahoo/10132/wahoo-systm\">RIP Sufferfest, hello Wahoo SYSTM: Ride with the pros on revamped training app</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nCommenting on what she would bring to the team, Pridham noted, ‘If I can just bring some small touches, some more modern things into the organisation, that could already make a big difference. The important thing is that all riders and staff feel they are part of a successful team.</p>\n<p>‘We will have fun with Lotto Soudal, but with the riders we need to go to war as well. And we can win the battle.’</p>\n<p>Pridham, who immersed herself in managing and directing after a 15-year career as a pro rider, will bring something new to Lotto Soudal, according to the team's general manager, John Lelangue.</p>\n<p>Lelangue interviewed five other candidates for the role but says he was immediately convinced Pridham was just the person they needed after his first interview with her. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"rdavidson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fe0f070bac4003f8e823b1ae1a08d3bcb25e47f13d7048f75d58c05e26eeaa1a","category":"Cycling"}
