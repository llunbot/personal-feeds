Wild Rye Freel</a> emerged as our top-rated women’s mountain bike shorts, taking into account the fit, features, comfort, as well as the brand. Wild Rye may be lesser-known than many of its mainstream competitors, but they have quite the following, and for good reason. The trail-oriented Freel shorts are their flagship model that helped put the brand on the map.</p><p></p><p>These shorts felt perfect from the first time they were tried on, with a very flattering fit. The waist sits comfortably at a mid-height with a snap and zip closure, and while they don’t have adjustments, they do have belt loops. Thankfully, they come in 10 waist sizes, 0-18, so it’s easy to get the right fit. The inseam length hangs just above the knee with a baggy flair that easily accommodates knee pads. The ethically and sustainably sourced WRDuraFlex material feels high quality and durable, with 4-way stretch, clear attention to detail in the seams and trims, and UPF 50 to boot. The Freel shorts look and feel like a well-made piece of clothing built to last through whatever the trail throws at you.</p><p></p><p>Riding in the Freel shorts just feels natural. They are pedal friendly and they move nicely with the body. Even the pockets are well done with an easy access zippered hip pocket and two open hand pockets on the front that are deep enough to be functional and secure while riding. The fabric shrugs off light rain and splashes from puddles well enough that they look clean at the end of rides in sloppy conditions. Importantly, they look cute off the bike and look good when worn either with or without knee pads on the trail. </p><p></p><p>Wild Rye is female-owned and they put a lot of emphasis on being conscious of impact. They are a Certified B Corp, Climate Neutral Certified, and a 1% for the Planet member. They also offer a “pre-loved” section where you can sell used Wild Rye items that are not available for return. The website also has a shorts comparison page that allows you to compare all the different fits and features of their shorts so you can see them all laid out and make an educated decision based on your needs and wants. We found their customer service to be great, and they generally just put off good vibes. </p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for versatile trail-riding shorts that come in a range of colors and prints, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F141271%2Fwild-rye-freel-mountain-bike-shorts-womens\">Wild Rye Freel</a> is our top recommendation.

Instead, they are made from a stretchy “performance denim” material that moves with you and allows for great freedom of movement. The material is mostly cotton and elastane but includes 13% recycled cotton and 11% recycled polyester. The Jorts have an athletic cut and the updated gusseted inner thigh reduces crotch seams and adds stretch where it’s needed. They have a short, 5.5-inch inseam, and the Diesel (black) colorway is also available with a 9-inch inseam if you want a little more leg coverage. </p><p></p><p>The Jorts feature typical jean pockets in the form of two mesh-lined front hand pockets and two back pockets. The back pockets fit a phone comfortably and it stays pretty solid but not entirely secure. Denim is a bit warmer overall and doesn’t dry out quite as quickly as more technical fabrics, but the shorter length of the Ripton Jorts helps keep you cool on warmer days. While these shorts may not be the best for a huge trail ride, they are perfect for the local dirt jumps, cruise rides with the girls, or that quick before/after work shred. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fripton-cut-off-jorts-womens-rpo0006\">Ripton &amp; Co. Jorts</a> are versatile and stylish so you can ride and go out on the town without a wardrobe change. They come in multiple denim colors including Mineral, Slate, Smoke, and Diesel, and either cut-off or hemmed styles with most offered in whole waist sizes between 24 and 36. They also happen to be quite affordable with prices ranging between $65 and $69 depending on the color/style. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fripton-cut-off-jorts-womens-rpo0006\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ripton-Co-posing-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ripton-Co-posing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Posing in the Ripton &amp; Co.

These shorts have been updated since then with a longer inseam, two zippered hip pockets (up from one), new low-profile waist adjustments, and a tougher but still very lightweight material. </p><p></p><p>The Dirt Roamer shorts feature 86% recycled polyester with easy-to-use dual waist adjusters and beautifully welded seams to reduce bunching and friction spots. The Fair Trade Certified™ sewn material is super light, and dreamy soft while maintaining amazing stretch. These shorts are so light and airy that it almost feels like you aren’t wearing anything while riding. The material moves incredibly freely with the body and each pedal stroke and goes virtually unnoticed on the trail. They come in sizes 0-22, so it should be easy for most people to get the right fit. The well-designed waist adjustment straps are very low-profile and secure and work well to take up some additional slack if needed.</p><p></p><p>In addition to breathing well and drying fast, the soft, stretchy material makes it easy to pull up your kneepads and the 12.5-inch inseam length and size of the leg opening means they pair well with them too. The two well-placed zippered side pockets are easy to access and fit everything most people will ever carry while riding, plus they open on top inside to pair with pockets on Patagonia’s matching liner shorts (sold separately). Patagonia products consistently feel high quality and are made with excellent attention to detail.</p><p></p><p>Patagonia has been a sustainability leader for as long as most people can remember and they continue to lead the charge both from a corporate standpoint and with the products they make. They are a 1% for the Planet member and support a number of activism organizations listed on their website with ways for customers to get involved based on their location. They offer mail-in repairs for most products and are often at events doing immediate repairs. They have a page with DIY videos on how to repair your own products as well as properly care for certain items to extend their lifespan. It is also easy to find used gear or trade-in gear through their website and their Worn Wear program to keep products in use longer.</p><p></p><p>Sustainability aside, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpatagonia-dirt-roamer-bike-short-womens\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer</a> shorts are an excellent choice for anyone seeking a well-designed, lightweight women’s mountain bike short for their two-wheeled adventures.

One of their latest women’s mountain bike shorts is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fcollections%2Fwomens-shorts-skirts-bibs%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-summit-pro-shell-shorts-19212201%3Fvariant%3D42471287586987\">Pearl Izumi Summit PRO Shell</a>. These super lightweight and minimalist shorts are made from a seriously stretchy material and feature the most venting of any shorts we tested earning them our top recommendation if ventilation is a priority. </p><p></p><p>The Summit PRO Shell shorts have an adjustable waist belt that pulls tension across the front half of the shorts with a metal hook clasp that stays secure while riding. We found they fit true to size and they are available in sizes 2-14, plus the waist adjustment works well to fine-tune the fit. The slightly less expensive Summit Shell shorts come in a wider range of sizes. They have a generous 12.75-inch inseam length that works well with or without knee pads, with ample coverage to protect from the sun and avoid the dreaded pad gap. Still, they are exceptionally pedal friendly as the 91% recycled material is incredibly lightweight, stretchy, and feels great against the skin. </p><p></p><p>Along with the ultra-lightweight material, the Summit PRO Shell shorts feature laser cut venting along the front inside of the thighs for amazing breathability and airflow. Two zippered hip pockets position items toward the back of the thigh for “pedaling comfort”, and while that is true, the angle makes the zippers somewhat challenging to zip with one hand while riding. </p><p></p><p>Pearl Izumi’s website provides detailed information and has lots of pictures of each product. They offer a 60-day “fit guarantee”, a lifetime warranty against factory defects on all products, as well as a crash replacement of 30% off a future purchase. Listed on each product page is an interesting sustainability meter, “Pedal to Zero”, that tells you how many miles you have to pedal to offset the climate impact of their products. The Summit PRO Shell shorts will take 18.61 miles to offset their impact. Their sustainability page also shows they have some pretty impressive goals to reach by 2025 as a company. </p><p></p><p>If you’re seeking a lightweight and well-ventilated pair of women’s mountain bike shorts for riding in hot weather or those all-day epics, we think the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fcollections%2Fwomens-shorts-skirts-bibs%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-summit-pro-shell-shorts-19212201%3Fvariant%3D42471287586987\">Pearl Izumi Summit PRO Shell</a> shorts are a great option to consider. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fcollections%2Fwomens-shorts-skirts-bibs%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-summit-pro-shell-shorts-19212201%3Fvariant%3D42471287586987\">Check Price at Pearl Izumi</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The lightweight and well-ventilated Pearl Izumi Summit Pro Shell women's mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pearl-Izumi-Summit-Pro-Shell-ventilation-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you find yourself on all-day epics that may include sunset light on a mountain top, the Pearl Izumi Summit PRO Shell may be the shorts for you.

The versatile Glidepath shorts fit well, are comfortable, and their technical fabric is tough and water-resistant.</p><p></p><p>Everything about the 7Mesh Glidepath shorts makes them feel like a high-quality product. The material, waist adjustment, pockets, and the overall fit combine to make these shorts one of our favorites. While not the softest material, it has a good amount of stretch and shifts easily with the pedal stroke and with the body on descents while having a tougher feel than lighter materials. The durable water repellant (DWR) proved to resist water very well on drizzly test rides making these a great option for inclement weather, variable conditions, or riding in wetter climates.</p><p></p><p>We found the cut to be very flattering on the hips and behind. It’s worth noting that their sizing is based solely on hip and thigh measurements, so it is important to reference their size chart or try these on before you buy. 7Mesh admits that they don’t have the largest size range, but they on their website they include links to other brands that do. The Glidepath shorts feature a zip and snap closure with a multi-position front belt closure made from stretchy soft material to fine-tune the fit. The longer 15” inseam is made to fit easily over knee pads for technical trail riding and it always seemed to be positioned perfectly at the top of the knee/kneepad while pedaling. The zippered hip pockets sit slightly higher than other shorts but fit a phone nicely and are super easy to access. The front hand pockets are deep enough to stash certain items without them falling out, and they are lined with a fine mesh to add some ventilation. </p><p></p><p>7Mesh perfects their products in-house in Squamish to be sure they are up to par before sending them to manufacturing. They offer Crash Replacement for free within 30 days and after that, they will repair your busted gear for a small fee. The Bluesign® approved and Oeko-Tex® Standard 100 certified fabric is PFC and PFAS-free. 7Mesh strives to be environmentally responsible but also to be socially conscious through diversity, equity, and inclusion, and they provide lots of information on their initiatives on their website if you’d like to learn more. Even the name, 7Mesh, is a tribute to the local indigenous tribes “and represents [their] commitment to contribute to progress on indigenous issues” in Canada. </p><p></p><p>If you’re seeking a high-quality pair of technical mountain bike shorts that can stand up to abuse and changing conditions, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2F7mesh-industries-glidepath-short-womens\">7Mesh Glidepath</a> is a fantastic option to consider.

Crafted from a thicker, heavy-duty material, these durable shorts are designed to take abuse while riding hard-hitting terrain. They aren’t the lightest or the most breathable, but these are the shorts we recommend if you’re spending your days at the bike park or shuttling rowdy descents.</p><p> </p><p>The Mischief shorts have a relaxed fit and are made from a Bluesign-certified 4-way stretch woven material. They have a relatively long inseam length that hangs down around the knee with ample space for knee pads and enough length to maintain good leg coverage and prevent pad gap while riding. The zip and snap closure is secure and velcro waist adjustment tabs on the outside of the waistband make it quick and easy to fine-tune the fit during your riding day. A stretchy mesh panel just below the back of the waistband helps a little heat and moisture escape, but these shorts are comparatively a bit warmer than models made with lighter materials. The heavier material helps keep you a bit warmer on cool days or when you aren’t exerting yourself very hard, along with the benefit of being a bit thicker and more protective against trailside branches or the occasional washout in a loose corner. </p><p></p><p>One thing that stands out about the Mischief shorts is the excellent pocket layout, and there is ample space for carrying snacks and essentials. The zippered pocket on the right thigh is perfect for access when you are sitting on the chairlift and the front hand pockets have zippers as well to keep your valuables secure when you’re riding rough terrain. The hand pockets are also lined with mesh so they could be used as a little extra venting if they aren’t carrying anything. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Ftroy-lee-designs-mischief-short-shell-womens\">Troy Lee Designs Mischief</a> shorts strike a nice blend of technical and durable for long days at the bike park or trail rides where you want a bit of extra protection or warmth.

Originally born from a Kickstarter campaign, the company has grown over time and has gained a strong footing in the market. One of their stated missions is “to offer women of all shapes and sizes the best selection of technical apparel”, and that is reflected in the large size range and variety of inseam lengths offered. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshredly-all-time-zipper-snap-mid-rise-11in-short-womens\">Shredly All-Time</a> is one of two baggy mountain bike shorts in their line that is available in 5-inch, 11-inch, and 14-inch (tested) inseam lengths to suit varying needs or preferences. </p><p> </p><p>One of the first things that stands out about the Shredly All-Time shorts is the super cute-looking style with a variety of cuts and a great range of artistic and thoughtful prints (and the newly added Noir – solid black for the masses). Offered in a range of inseam length options with a zip and snap closure and partial elastic waistband, or a full elastic waist (the Limitless model comes in sizes 0-24), these shorts are super comfy with a relaxed yet flattering fit. The 14” length we tested sits nicely over knee pads and works well with or without them, making them a versatile option that could be worn for either big days in the saddle or long days at the bike park. </p><p></p><p>The 91% recycled polyester/spandex <em>ecoMove</em> material is light enough to feel good riding in warm weather while still feeling durable enough to withstand the inevitable encounters with the dirt. The 4-way stretch fabric along with the stretchy waistband ensures these shorts move very freely with the body while riding. Two hand pockets, a zippered hip pocket, and a cargo pocket on the right thigh ensure you have plenty of room to stash your essentials whether you’re on or off the bike. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshredly-all-time-zipper-snap-mid-rise-11in-short-womens\">Shredly All-Time</a> shorts in the 14-inch length we tested are a great option for people who ride in knee pads all the time, taller women, or those who prefer a longer length. The other inseam options make sure there’s something for everyone, and the variety of colors and prints add some serious style points. Shredly also makes a variety of tank tops, short and long-sleeve jerseys, and gloves in matching prints and complimentary colors so you can finish off your kit. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshredly-all-time-zipper-snap-mid-rise-11in-short-womens\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fshorts%2Fshredly-mtb-womens%23image%3D217282%2F913684%2Fshredly-all-time-11-zipper-snap-mid-rise-shorts-women-s-.jpg\">Check Price at EVO</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding in the Shredly All-Time 14&quot; women's mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shredly-All-Time-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Shredly’s variety of prints, colors, and cuts are enough to make anyone smile.

With a slimmer, stretchy fit and a broad stretch waistband like a yoga pant, the fit is flattering and impressively comfy, making them feel like you could wear them all day. They also come in plain black or a couple of fun prints including TLD athlete Micayla Gatto’s Rosewood which features her original artwork.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other models in the TLD line, the Luxe shorts have a shorter inseam and a much slimmer fit. They strike us as a great option for women who prefer a shorter length, typically don’t ride with knee pads (as there would likely be a gap), and are seeking a flattering fit and high level of comfort. The 4-way stretch material of the shorts and waistband hugs the body nicely while allowing for impressive freedom of movement on the bike. The size range is limited to five sizes between XS-XL, but the supple stretch of the material and waistband is quite accommodating. </p><p></p><p>The Luxe shorts feature laser cut venting on the panels along the inner thighs and their shorter length helps make them versatile and light feeling even though the material is fairly hearty. Though they only have two pockets, the zippered “phone-specific” pocket on the back/side of the right hip fit securely holds a phone and can fit other things like chapstick, a small snack, and even a pair of gloves. Trust us, we tried. Its placement is different but the position behind the thigh keeps contents out of the way but still accessible. The small zippered pocket at the back of the waistband works well for a credit card and/or car key, so you can potentially bring everything needed for a smaller ride without a pack.</p><p></p><p>While Troy Lee Designs does not boast their sustainability as loudly as other brands, they certainly are making an effort with the materials they use.

With a generous inseam length and technical fabric, the Essential MTB shorts have you covered for any type of riding.</p><p> </p><p>The Essential MTB shorts are made from a nice lightweight but durable material with a bit of stretch and a durable water-repellant finish. We found them to have a flattering cut that really hugs the hips and behind along with a dual snap and zipper waist closure and external velcro adjustment tabs on both sides to dial in the fit. The legs have a fairly slim fit, but the 13-inch inseam length and leg opening is designed to “fit perfectly over POC VPD knee pads”. While we didn’t test them with POC brand knee pads, we can confirm they work well with other brands or without kneepads too.  </p><p></p><p>The POC Essential MTB shorts have 3 zippered pockets – two hand pockets, and a smaller pocket on the back of the raised waistband for a card or car key. The zippered hand pockets, while secure, don’t have the best design, in our opinion, as they hold the contents on top of the thigh which isn’t the most comfortable while riding or particularly accessible either. Still, there is enough storage to stash all your goodies while riding. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fpoc-essential-mtb-short-womens\">POC Essential MTB</a> shorts are a solid option that covers the essentials (pun intended).

A panel of stretch mesh venting just below the back of the waistband helps reduce sweat on the lower back/behind. A zippered fly is secured under a flap of fabric with a metal hook clasp and ladder strap that serves as the waist adjustment system. Ample silicone beads on the inside/back of the waistband add texture to help keep the shorts in place while riding. </p><p></p><p>The Airmatic shorts fit somewhat snugly through the hips with ample space for the thighs and a longer inseam that works well with or without knee pads. The three zippered pockets provide adequate space for all your goodies, and the one on the right thigh works great for a phone. The light, lavender color we tested looks great when new, but it is somewhat prone to staining and we found that it is somewhat see-through. Thankfully, they come in darker color options like Slate Blue and Black.

What started as a fairly modest line of mtb apparel has steadily grown into a larger range with various models of shorts, pants, jerseys, jackets, accessories, and even knee pads. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingwomensmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226091%2Frapha-trail-bike-shorts-womens\">Rapha Trail Shorts</a> are their flagship model intended to be a versatile option suitable for most styles of riding.</p><p></p><p>Like many Rapha products, the Trail shorts aren’t exactly inexpensive. In fact, they are the priciest model we tested by a small margin. That said, they are made from a quality Bluesign and Okeo-Tex-certified fabric that is a blend of 88% nylon and 12% elastane. The shorts come with a number of color-matched stick-on patches so you can do minor repairs at home and they offer a free repair service for damage you aren’t able to fix yourself. While pricey, it’s clear they want you to get your money’s worth. </p><p></p><p>Compared to most of the other shorts we tested, the Trail Shorts have a unique cut. The low profile waistband rises quite high on the waist, and the upper part of the shorts is very form-fitting around the hips and buttocks. The waist is secured with a zipper fly and a locking snap, and while the snap certainly doesn’t open on its own, it is a little fiddly to deal with until you get used to it. There is a little bit of stretch to the waistband, but you’ll definitely want to be sure you get the correct size to avoid pressure on the lower abdomen. The legs are a bit roomier and the long inseam ensures they work well whether you wear knee pads or not. </p><p></p><p>Two zippered pockets, one on each thigh, are a great size and provide easy access with their backloading design. Each pocket has a small sleeve inside that fits a phone and prevents it from flopping around while you pedal or descend rough terrain. While these shorts have some great features and clear attention to detail, our athletic-bodied tester didn’t completely get along with the fit.

An adrenaline junkie with a racing background, she enjoys all types of riding but has a taste for steep, aggressive, technical trails. Kira has been mountain biking for 13+ years and working in various fields in the outdoor industry for over 20. She has worked in retail soft and hard goods in the snowboard and mountain bike industries all over the western US and New Zealand. Her riding and work experience combine to give her unique insight into product quality, technical features, and design from the inside out. She has spent years traveling the US, Canada, and Australia with her mountain bike and swapped gear knowledge with athletes all along the way. Her ongoing search for the best and highest quality mountain bike gear means that she loves to try new brands and products as much as possible. As a mountain bike coach with a retail background, she also understands the range of needs of people from a variety of backgrounds, skill levels, and riding styles. Among her friends, her expertise and experience make her the go-to source for product recommendations, especially when it comes to mountain biking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best women’s mountain bike shorts on the market in 2023, we chose 12 models to put to the test. Over the course of several months, Kira put each pair of shorts through their paces on the varied terrain of the greater Lake Tahoe and Reno, NV area. From steep and aggressive skidders, flow trails, all-day epics, and casual after-work spins in a wide range of spring weather conditions, these shorts have definitely seen it all. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action.jpeg\"><img width=\"1440\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action.jpeg\" alt=\"Review author Kira Deschaux testing the best women's mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action.jpeg 1440w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Essential-MTB-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Going to extremes to put the POC Essential MTB shorts through their paces while testing the best women’s mountain bike shorts.

They are technical pieces of apparel that you wear when you ride. Yes, you can wear any old shorts you’d like when mountain biking, but there is a reason there are specific shorts for the job. And, not only are there specific shorts for mountain biking, but like everything else in the sport, different models are designed to cater to different types of riding and needs. No matter the type of riding you do, we recommend mountain bike specific shorts because they are made for the task. Reasons to wear baggy mountain bike shorts include zippered or sealed pockets, technical fabrics that stretch, resist abrasion, dry quickly, and, of course, style. Here are some things to consider when searching for your next pair of shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Type of Riding Do You Do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As there are many different styles of mountain biking, women’s mountain bike shorts are made in varying cuts, designs, and fabrics to meet the needs of riders across the spectrum. If you are riding downhill, you’ll likely want a longer inseam for more leg coverage and compatibility with knee pads, as well as a tougher material that can stand up to the rigors of aggressive riding. If you’re more of a trail or XC rider, there are lightweight and well-ventilated options that barely even feel like they are there. Aggressive trail and all-mountain riders will often seek the happy middle ground between the burly downhill options and the lightweight XC models. Many women’s mountain bike shorts can also easily span across multiple riding styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"7Mesh Glidepath women's mountain bike shorts fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A proper fit is the first and most important step in finding the right mountain bike shorts. The 7Mesh Glidepath shorts shown here fit pretty much perfectly. (photo: Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like anything else you wear while riding, getting the right fit is the most critical piece of the puzzle when buying mountain bike shorts. They need to fit comfortably, with enough space to wear a chamois underneath (if you wear one) and have enough width or stretch to be able to pull up your knee pads (if you wear them). Even if you don’t wear either of those, you still want your shorts to move with your body and be comfortable while exerting yourself. Comfort is key because we have enough to think about when we are focusing on the features and trail ahead, we don’t want to be distracted by ill-fitting clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People come in all shapes and sizes, so trying shorts on is the best way to ensure that they fit appropriately for your body type. Likewise, shorts come in multiple sizes, of course, and most brands have detailed size charts on their websites that are helpful in determining what size will fit you best. For women’s mountain bike shorts, these size charts often include both waist and hip measurements. Some brands offer their shorts in a larger number of sizes. Patagonia, for example, offers the Dirt Roamer shorts in sizes 0-22, which should help to ensure a more precise fit. Wild Rye and Shredly offer their shorts in a similar size range. Other brands, like 100% and Troy Lee Designs, offer their shorts in fewer total sizes, XS, S, M, L, and XL, though they still aim to fit a wide range of body shapes and sizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"100% Ridecamp women's mountain bike shorts worn with knee pads\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Ridecamp-Knee-Pads-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you ride in knee pads, you may want to consider shorts with a longer inseam to help prevent pad gap. (photo: Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Inseam Length</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How long shorts are is an important factor to consider, as different models have different cuts and some are even offered in multiple inseam lengths to suit varying needs and preferences. Riders who wear knee pads often prefer a longer inseam length so that the shorts hang down low enough to cover the top cuff of the pads to avoid what is called “pad gap”, or skin showing between the pad and shorts. Similarly, those with longer legs or who prefer the extra coverage or look of a longer inseam tend to gravitate towards shorts with 12-inch, or longer, inseams. While they provide less coverage and protection from the sun or the ground in the event of a crash, many women may prefer a shorter inseam for style reasons. Thankfully, there are options to suit all preferences, and some brands even offer their shorts in multiple lengths. Shredly, for example, sells the All-Time shorts in 5-inch, 11-inch, and 14-inch inseam lengths to cover all the bases.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"7Mesh Glidepath women's mountain bike shorts, technical fabric, water beading\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7Mesh-Glidepath-Technical-Fabric-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Most mountain bike shorts are made from technical fabrics that are stretchy, tear-resistant, and quick drying.

(photo: Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Technical Fabrics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main things that sets mountain bike shorts apart from other types of shorts is the materials used in their construction. Most often, this is a blend of polyester or nylon and elastane or spandex. One of the most important performance benefits is that these materials tend to have 4-way or 2-way stretch so the material moves with your body on the bike. Mountain biking is a dynamic sport, your shorts should be as well. These fabrics are also generally tear-resistant and can be weather resistant if treated with a durable water-repellant (DWR). In general, the fabrics used in mountain bike shorts are also relatively lightweight and quick drying. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Wild Rye Freel zippered phone pocket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wil-Rye-Freel-pocket-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Depending on what you carry, pockets may be an important factor to consider. Fortunately, many mountain bike shorts, like the Wild Rye Freel, have good pocket designs that work well with modern smartphones. (photo: Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pockets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know there is a problem in the women’s clothing industry with a lack of sufficient pockets, but mountain bike shorts tend to not follow that trend. YAY! While the number and placement of pockets on a pair of mountain bike shorts isn’t a make or break factor, it is definitely worthy of consideration depending on what you carry on a ride. Almost all baggy mountain bike shorts have at least one pocket, with most having 2-4 in various configurations. Sometimes these pockets are zippered, and other times they are not. How many pockets a pair of shorts has and their orientation can make the difference between carrying a pack or not, and may play a role in how comfortable you are while riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With pockets, we think about ease of access when riding and what is essential to have in the pocket. Things we carry on a ride: phone for easy access to maps and taking photos (and let’s be real, text messages too), chapstick with SPF, and a snack, always a snack! Sometimes this list includes keys and a wallet (or card) if trying to ride without a pack. That’s a lot of stuff to be hauling around, but two well-placed pockets can usually get the job done. Of course, your individual needs may vary, but at the very least, a zippered pocket that can fit a modern smartphone is the minimum we look for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The placement of pockets is also a factor. Thankfully, many, but certainly not all, brands have recognized the need for well-designed pockets that hold their contents securely, are easy to access, and don’t allow their contents to flop around while riding. Others may include open hand pockets that add a bit of style and enhance functionality off the bike when grabbing food, drinks, or running errands post-ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts.jpeg\"><img width=\"994\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts.jpeg\" alt=\"Troy Lee Designs Mischief women's mountain bike shorts posing shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts.jpeg 994w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tro-Lee-Designs-Mischief-shorts-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you’re riding chairlifts and wearing a full-face helmet, then ventilation is probably less important than a durable, more protective fabric. (photo: Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ventilation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the type of riding you do and the temperatures you ride in, ventilation may or may not be an important consideration. Downhill riders who ride lifts or shuttles to the top of their descents are typically less concerned with the ventilating properties of their shorts than those who spend lots of time pedaling to the top of the hill. Likewise, those who live and ride in more temperate climates may care less about ventilation and breathability than those who ride frequently in hot temperatures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some shorts come with ventilation in the form of laser-cut holes or mesh panels while other shorts are made with lightweight materials that are super airy and breathable on their own. Models like the Patagonia Dirt Roamer and Pearl Izumi Summit PRO Shell are super light, breathable, and quick drying, and are our top recommendations for riding in hot weather or on super high-intensity rides. Shorts like the Troy Lee Designs Mischief and the 100% Airmatic, on the other hand, and made from heavier materials that are better suited to days at the bike park or when riding in cooler temperatures. Again, what works best for you will depend on your specific needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Shredly All-Time women's mountain bike shorts style\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-Style-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Baggy mountain bike shorts are a style in and of themselves, but there are loads of options to suit your tastes. Shredly offers a huge range of cuts and prints, including this subtle topo map design. (photo: Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On their own, baggy mountain bike shorts are a style choice. They signify that you ride dirt. Across the brands we tested there are a lot of different looks with some that focus more on sweet colors and patterns and others that take a more subdued approach. The way different models fit also plays into style with some leaning towards more form-fitting and others trending baggier. How you like your shorts to fit will depend on your personal style and also your riding style. With so many options, most people should be able to find a pair that fits and looks how you want them to. When you look good you feel good, and when you feel good you can perform better on the bike.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brand</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people are brand loyalists, and there is nothing wrong with that. If you have a brand and aesthetic that you like, go for that matching kit! There are quite a few brands out there, however, and, especially for women, there are a ton of different fits. While brand loyalty is fine, we feel that ensuring the shorts fit your body is much more important than the brand itself. If there is a pair that just feels right but maybe doesn’t match the rest of your kit (or your partner’s favorite brand), we say go for it. Having the right fit will enhance your comfort and performance more than any brand’s logo. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding a singletrack in the Wild Rye Freel women's mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wild-Rye-Freel-Action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Many brands are taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of the products they make. Wild Rye, who make the Freel shorts pictured here, is one such brand that’s trying to make a difference. (photo: Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Environmental Impact</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While most people participate in the sport of mountain biking for the enjoyment of being outside, virtually every product we buy related to riding bikes has some sort of environmental impact. Within the mountain bike industry, many brands are starting to come around and are trying to make positive changes in this regard. Some brands use materials made from recycled content or are reducing harmful chemicals used to treat their fabrics, while others support environmental sustainability projects or advocacy, among other things. As consumers, we have the power to speak with our wallets, so if the environmental impact of the products you wear is important to you, you can choose to support the brands that are making an effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Warranty, Crash Replacement, or Repair</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bikers love a warranty, right? Let’s face it, everything we use when mountain bike is prone to damage, and our shorts often take a beating from trailside bushes, trees, mud, dust, and the occasional crash. We’re not going to baby our mountain bike shorts, but we still want them to last a long time and get our money’s worth. Many shorts have warranties against manufacturing defects or offer exchanges/replacements if you get the wrong size. More recently, a number of brands offer crash repairs to help extend the life of your product rather than just throwing it away. Rapha, for example, includes color-matched patches to fix small holes in their mountain bike garments, and if it’s too difficult to repair it at home, they offer a free repair service. Likewise, Patagonia has DIY repair videos on their website and they have a product repair service as well as the Worn Wear program where you can trade in used gear for credit towards future purchases. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the world of mountain biking, shorts are relatively inexpensive compared to many of the other things we buy. Still, the price of shorts varies pretty dramatically among the models we tested from $69 up to $158. Any of the shorts in this review will get the job done better than non-mountain bike specific shorts, and most will likely last you a couple of seasons or more barring any catastrophic crashes or serious mistreatment. The biggest differences are that less expensive models tend to be made from less technical materials and have more basic designs than their more expensive counterparts. The Ripton &amp; Co. Jorts, for example, are made from stretchy “performance denim” and are essentially just cut-off jean shorts. While they may not fit everyone’s idea of mountain bike shorts, they are surprisingly functional, versatile, have a unique style, and are relatively affordable. Still, we found the highest performance and best features in the more expensive models we tested. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-800x533.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shredly-All-Time-riding-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Review author, Kira Deschaux, spent months and many hundreds of miles testing the best women’s mountain bike shorts on the market.

First, the shorts are designed with mountain biking in mind. Most shorts have athletic cuts, articulated waists for enhanced comfort in the seated pedaling position, and high crotch gussets to prevent getting snagged on your seat. They are made from technical fabrics that stretch with your body, resist tearing, sometimes resist water, and dry quickly. Some shorts have ventilation, and most have pockets designed to hold items comfortably and securely while riding. They also come in varying styles and designs intended to suit different styles/types of riding. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why Should I Wear Baggy Mountain Bike Shorts?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There’s certainly no rule that says all mountain bikers must ride in baggy shorts. In fact, many cross-country riders or racers choose to ride in spandex/lycra shorts for various reasons. That said, the majority of mountain bikers tend to wear baggy shorts these days. Not only do they provide a little modesty, but they also provide leg coverage and protection from the sun and serve as an additional layer of protection from scrapes and abrasion. If you wear knee pads, many of the longer inseam models interface with them well for added protection and a clean, gap-free look. It’s also a style thing, as many people simply prefer the way that baggy shorts look, and the variety of cuts, colors, and prints allow you to express yourself out on the trail. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What About a Padded Liner or Chamois?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Padded liner shorts, also known as a chamois (pronounced: <em>chammy</em>), are used by many, but certainly not all, riders to enhance comfort while riding. Comprised of a tight-fitting spandex or mesh material with a chamois pad for your underside, they create a cushioned surface between your sit bones and your bike saddle. When used with baggy mountain bike shorts, these thin liners are simply worn underneath. All of the shorts we tested for this buyer’s guide are sold without a padded liner short, although several can also be purchased with one for an additional fee. While an included liner short can add value to a purchase, they are typically not the highest quality, in our experience. In general, we have found that it’s best to spend a little more on a higher-quality padded liner short for maximum comfort. This ensures that you can get one that fits properly and provides the desired level of cushioning.  </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"mountain bike helmets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Yakima StageTwo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0066-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Hitch Bike Racks of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-womens-mountain-bike-shorts/\">The Best Women’s Mountain Bike Shorts of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Kira Deschaux","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"eeb2c4cc91854eb8d08e7b01bba7478075c1b410ea360ccc8f9bcfec5f96f4c3","category":"Cycling"}
