There is no other sign from Sky that the offer relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>We think it's time to treat yourself to something new 👀<br /><br />Sky Mobile customers: if there's one good choice you make today, let it be registering your interest to to get all the info on the upcoming announcement, trust us 🎁<br /><br />👉 <a href=\"https://t.co/BolP4S9xxo\">https://t.co/BolP4S9xxo</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/r7E3MbBIR6\">pic.twitter.com/r7E3MbBIR6</a></p>— Sky (@SkyUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyUK/status/1433731525208649728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 3, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome carriers have been known to provide discounted offers to customers who sign up to a contract for a next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> model before it is officially announced, and this marketing appears to be in line with those similar promotions in the past. It is also possible that the announcement relates to something else entirely, but the September 14 date is sufficient proof for some observers that it relates to the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the ‌iPhone 13‌ is set to be unveiled next week on September 14 as rumors suggest, invites would likely be sent out later today.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sky/\">Sky</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/uk-carrier-teases-iphone-13/\">UK Carrier Teases 'the Next Generation' Ahead of iPhone 13 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-carrier-teases-the-next-generation-ahead-of-iphone-13-launch.2309948/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y27Q6WL-Y38:tHK__8T3Mxc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y27Q6WL-Y38:tHK__8T3Mxc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Y27Q6WL-Y38\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df659de2b05b24325a5b4aeeeecdf2d1cb422af32b5ad1c4ded82d716582d8b8","category":"Apple"}
