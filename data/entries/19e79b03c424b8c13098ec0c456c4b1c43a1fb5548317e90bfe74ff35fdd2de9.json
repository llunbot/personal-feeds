[...]</p>\n\n<p>The antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option\nthat would have forced Google to sell off Android, the people\nsaid. [...] The antitrust enforcers are set to propose that\nGoogle uncouple its Android smartphone operating system from its\nother products, including search and its Google Play mobile app\nstore, which are now sold as a bundle, the people said. They are\nalso prepared to seek a requirement that Google share more\ninformation with advertisers and give them more control over\nwhere their ads appear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs hard to say from Bloomberg‚Äôs second-hand reporting‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâfrom people familiar with the matter‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhat exactly the DOJ is specifically going to ask for. But based on this report, I have to say, neither of these proposals makes much sense.</p>\n\n<p>With Chrome, effectively what the DOJ is saying is that Google, as the monopoly search engine, should be disallowed from making its own web browser (which itself holds a monopoly share on web browsing‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhich share would be overwhelming if not for Safari). But Chrome, in and of itself, isn‚Äôt very valuable to anyone other than Google itself. The value Chrome holds to Google is inextricably tied to Chrome‚Äôs default integration with Google search and other Google web apps.</p>\n\n<p>If Google were forced to sell Chrome, who‚Äôd make the default web browser for Android? Android can‚Äôt ship without a default browser. And the DOJ wants Google to ‚Äúuncouple‚Äù Android from the Google Play store? Allowing Google to keep Android but not make its own web browser or app store is just nonsense. It might make some measure of sense to declare that Google has to sell the <em>desktop</em> version of Chrome‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe apps for Windows and Mac‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut then what happens to ChromeOS, which is not a monopoly, but is a significant competitor to Windows, MacOS, and iPadOS?</p>\n\n<p>Chrome is not a standalone business. Android is not a standalone business. They‚Äôre both just appendages of Google that serve only as distribution channels for the advertising Google shows in search results, and the money it makes from advertising and game commissions in the Play Store. It‚Äôs like saying I have to sell my left foot. It‚Äôs very valuable to me, but of no value to anyone on its own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/241118/p27#a241118p27\">Techmeme‚Äôs roundup</a>ü•âü•â.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/18/doj-mehta-chrome\">¬†‚òÖ¬†</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"19e79b03c424b8c13098ec0c456c4b1c43a1fb5548317e90bfe74ff35fdd2de9","category":"Tech"}
