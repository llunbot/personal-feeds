In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/\">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection of such stories. March's list includes fascinating papers on such topics as how the brain responds to speaking Klingon (or Dothraki, or Navi), the discovery of creepy preclassic Salvadoran puppets, the effectiveness of \"dazzle camouflage,\" and how male blue-lined octopuses manage not to be cannibalized by their chosen mates.</p>\n<h2>Wind Cave’s rocks fluoresce under black light</h2>\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"431\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cave1-640x431.jpg\" alt=\"Several fluorescence measurements of a zebra calcite in Wind Cave were taken using portable spectrometers.\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cave1-640x431.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cave1-1024x689.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cave1-768x517.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cave1-980x660.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cave1.jpg 1200w\" />\n      Several fluorescence measurements of a zebra calcite in Wind Cave were taken using portable spectrometers.\n        Credit:\n          Joshua Sebree\n      \n<p>South Dakota's Wind Cave gets its name from the flow of air moving continually through its many passages and equalizing the atmospheric pressure between the air inside and outside—almost like the cave is \"breathing.\" Its rock and mineral formations also boast a unique chemistry that fluoresces when exposed to black light, according to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RMhmcEpZnGc\">talks presented</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076978\">spring meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. That fluorescence could shed light on how life can thrive in extreme environments, including that of Jupiter's moon, Europa.</p>\n<p>University of Northern Iowa astrobiologist Joshua Sebree and several students have been mapping new areas of Wind Cave (as well as other caves in the US), recording the passages, rock formations, minerals, and lifeforms they encounter in the process. They noticed that under UV light, certain parts of Wind Cave took on otherworldly hues, thanks to different concentrations of organic and inorganic fossilized chemical compounds. Those areas seem to indicate where water once flowed, carrying minerals into the cave from the surface 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, according to their analysis of the fluorescent spectra. Sebree et al. found that Wind Cave was likely carved out by waters rich in manganese, producing zebra stripes that glow pink under UV light, revealing the calcites that grew within as a result of those waters.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/research-roundup-2400-year-old-clay-puppets-this-is-your-brain-on-klingon/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/research-roundup-2400-year-old-clay-puppets-this-is-your-brain-on-klingon/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c376fcf02dd51aa3858ce95530b79976e95225878ee5aec21e5d163e1ab91afe","category":"Tech"}
