Good vibes. Nice, approachable, and friendly. A pleasure to be around. Popularized in Latin American surf culture.</em></p>\n<p>Our bicycles are built with versatility in mind. Whether you’re bikepacking, shredding local trails, grinding some gravel, or cruising around town with a basket full of groceries, this bike can be with you for life, adapting to life’s changes and your interests. Throw a rigid fork on it, maybe some drop bars, go singlespeed, mount a rack, or a basket, and just enjoy riding the darned thing.</p>\n<p>It starts with a hand-crafted titanium frame. Designed to run a 130mm suspension fork, or build it rigid for a bikepacking machine. It’s got the mounts for bottles and racks for the longer days, and geometry to support you regardless of how long you are riding. A frame large enough to fit a frame bag and a reach long enough for some swoopy bars to top off the bike. The Buena is ready for whatever you throw at it!</p>\n<p>Why Colt likes it: It’s the perfect bike for riding the Colorado Trail, loaded or unloaded.</p>\n<p>Why Mark likes it: It’s the only mountain bike I need. From after-work rides to weeklong excursions, this is the bike I reach for every time.</p>\n<p><img width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-1-2.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-1-2.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-1-2.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-2-2.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-2-2.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-2-2.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<h3>Frame Details</h3>\n<p>Tubing: The finest U.S.-made titanium tubes on the market.

We operate on a small batch, “community-supported bicycle” model.</p>\n<p>Starting a bike brand is an expensive endeavor. The bicycle community is about the strongest community we’ve ever known, especially here in our hometown of Durango. What we’re doing isn’t all that different than community-supported agriculture (CSA). Farmers need money to get started, so they sell their crops in advance. As for Buena Onda, we’ll be putting out small batches of bikes every quarter. To get a bike, you’ll put down a 50% deposit, then when the bike is finished, we’ll send it to you. By supporting our brand via this ordering process, we’re offering low introductory pricing as a reward for helping us get off the ground.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.buenaondabikes.com/buenabike\" target=\"_blank\">More info about ordering and pricing</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-5.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-5.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_Buena_Onda_Presale-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Local</h3>\n<p>Buena Onda effectively uses 4 local Durango, CO businesses to bring these bikes together. From our welder, local bike shop, and branding artist, to the guy who makes our vinyl masks, we’re trying to keep it local. Even our Buena Bars are bent just a few hours south in Albuquerque.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.buenaondabikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">See more at Buena Onda Bikes and learn more about their first small batch presale!</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/introducing-buena-onda-bikes/\">Introducing Buena Onda Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e16ff70c5e34cafa6e576a9b5047d802327f01dba8cea42ab5da903f9f692fd3","category":"Cycling"}
