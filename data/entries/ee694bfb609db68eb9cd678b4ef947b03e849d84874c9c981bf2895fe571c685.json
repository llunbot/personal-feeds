Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>HEALDSBURG, Calif.—Earlier this summer, Ars got its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-best-audi-ev-so-far-we-drive-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/\">first drive</a> of Audi's new Q6 e-tron on some very wet roads in Spain. Then, we were driving pre-production Q6s in Euro-spec. Now, the electric SUV is on sale in the US, with more power in the base model and six months more refinement for its software. But the venue change did not bring a change of weather—heavy rain was the order of the day, making me wonder if Audi is building its new electric vehicle on the site of an ancient rain god's temple?</p>\n<p>Of all its rivals, Audi appears to have settled into a nomenclature for its vehicles that at least makes a little sense. Odd numbers are for internal combustion engines, even numbers for EVs, although it also appends \"e-tron\" on the end to make that entirely clear... and give francophones something to snicker about. (Yes, the e-tron GT does not fit into this schema, but nobody's perfect.)</p>\n<p>The Q6 e-tron is also the most advanced EV to wear Audi's four rings. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/audi-debuts-its-next-ev-platform-with-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/\">Built on a new architecture called PPE</a> (premium platform electric), at its heart is an 800 V powertrain with a 100 kWh (94.4 kWh useable) lithium-ion battery pack that powers a permanently excited synchronous motor driving the rear wheels, and in the case of the quattro versions, an asynchronous motor. The electric motors have 30 percent less energy consumption than those used in the Q8 e-tron, and are smaller and lighter.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/heres-what-we-learned-driving-audis-new-q6-and-sq6-electric-suvs/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/heres-what-we-learned-driving-audis-new-q6-and-sq6-electric-suvs/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
