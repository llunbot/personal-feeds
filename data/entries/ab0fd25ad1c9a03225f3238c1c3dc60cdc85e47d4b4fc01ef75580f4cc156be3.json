The headliner is likely to be a pair of new iPad Pros with M3 chips, OLED displays, slightly larger screens, and refined designs. Riding shotgun will be a refreshed 10.9-inch iPad Air with an M2 chip, plus a brand-new 12.9-inch Air meant to give large-screened iPad fans an option that doesn’t cost as much as the iPad Pro.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019298#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019298&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab0fd25ad1c9a03225f3238c1c3dc60cdc85e47d4b4fc01ef75580f4cc156be3","category":"Tech"}
