Larger wheels require the chain to articulate less. Bending a chain causes friction between the plates. By making the wheels larger the chain needs to bend less every time it runs through the derailleur. Additionally, friction is reduced by using high quality bearings, and low contact seals. And lastly, a large wheel will have a lower rotating speed than a small wheel at a fixed chain speed. Although the effect of that last one is minimal.</p><div id=\"attachment_273176\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-273176\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike.jpg\" alt=\"kogel kolossos oversize derailleur cage pulley gravel bike\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1094\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike-297x203.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike-800x547.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike-120x82.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike-768x525.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29154127/kogel-kolossos-oversize-derailleur-cage-gravel-bike-1536x1050.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-273176\">The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/01/02/kogel-kolossos-oversized-derailleur-pulley-cage-offers-colossal-stiffness-low-friction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kogel Kolossos</a> Oversize Derailleur Pulley on a Shimano GRX Gravel setup</p></div><p><strong>Muc-Off:</strong> The larger the pulley wheel diameter over stock allows the chain articulation angle to be reduced, resulting in a reduction of friction as the chain articulation angle has a direct impact on power loss.

These include aspects such as efficient tooth profiles and also specific materials and coatings for the wheels that reduce friction and increase performance.</p><p>Bearings can be optimised for the specific oversize application giving scope to reduce frictional losses not considered in standard bearings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>absoluteBLACK: </strong>The simple answer is power saving in the drivetrain. Most cyclists are familiar with the wattage savings that are possible to achieve with different chain lubricants. However, the lesser known things are the savings (and their principles) possible to achieve on the derailleur cage itself despite the fact that it is an “unloaded” part of the chain.</p><p>Many cyclists are led to believe that “free spinning pulley bearings” are the source of most gains/savings in oversized pulley wheel cages but unfortunately that is not accurate. Free spinning without load is not relevant. What matters is how the bearings operate under real load conditions. Or, in other words, what is their coefficient of friction under the load of the chain.</p><p>Moreover, bearing friction represents only a very small portion of overall savings. Meaning, both good pulley bearings consume less than 0.3W altogether. Better bearings can improve that by about 0.1W range. The measurable gains come from the cage’s spring tension preload modification, where up to 1.2W can be gained by changing the cage design to accommodate it.</p><p>However, the biggest saving comes from the size of the pulleys. Larger pulleys reduce the rotation angle between chain link plates around pins during the operation (on the pulleys) hence why it reduces the friction on the chain itself. Or, in other words, the chain articulates less when engaging with a larger pulley, and therefore, encounters less friction. The value of that saving is dependent on the chain lubrication that was used.</p><p>Our HOLLOWCAGE has however another very important advantage that separates us from other products of its kind. It silences the drivetrain. As it’s known, common polymer pulleys are fairly loud and aluminium pulleys are even louder as the material radiates the sound more than a polymer.</p><p>We created a new generation of pulleys, which are able to reduce the sound level by 12-14dB when compared to stock DuraAce pulleys thanks to our patent pending solution incorporating special xring rubber bands to dampen the chain impact on pulleys. This corresponds to roughly 60% of the noise reduction. Practically speaking, the cage (and by this drivetrain) becomes very silent.</p><p>An interesting fact is that over 80% of noise from a whole drivetrain comes from the top pulley engaging with the chain. Should you buy it? We were always up front saying that you should first invest in better wheels, tyres, a great chain lubricant and, for example, oval chainrings (as those upgrades will give you bigger savings all together) before you invest in an oversized pulley cage.</p><p>Our system should be purchased when you have already made other upgrades as it’s the ‘cherry on top of the cake’ of the upgrades you can make. It would be the final step in drivetrain optimization which all together can provide you over 10 Watts of “free” power that is simply saved (not gained) by reducing the frictional losses in your drivetrain.</p><p><strong>Are we likely to see even bigger oversized derailleur pulleys anytime soon?</strong></p><p><strong>Kogel: </strong>I doubt it. Maybe someone will develop a 20 tooth wheel, just to one-up the other players on the market. We have seen this happen in mountain bike cassettes recently. The main problem that is stopping Kogel from going larger than our current wheel size is ground clearance. As wheels get larger, the derailleur cage needs to be longer, especially on road derailleurs where the upper pulley runs in line with the pivot point.&nbsp;</p><p>Mountain bike derailleurs have an offset upper pulley, which allows us to keep the cage length the same or even slightly shorter than the stock derailleur. There might be an opportunity to run a larger lower pulley, but that is not something we have on the drawing table right now.</p><p><strong>Muc-Off: </strong>With larger and larger pulley wheels there are diminishing returns when considering overall efficiency. For example, there is a point where the extended length of an oversize derailleur cage may create issues in optimizing chain tension.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3.jpg\" alt=\"muc off lops oversize derailleur pulley upgrade parts closeup of lower pulley wheel\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/muc-off-lops-lightweight-oversize-precision-shifting-derailleur-pulley-3-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>absoluteBLACK: </strong>Everything is possible, but it makes very little sense to go even bigger. As mentioned earlier, the bigger the pulley the smaller the rotation (bending) angle between the chain link plates around the pin when engaging the teeth. However, from 17 tooth size onward the gain becomes exponentially smaller making very little sense to go over 18-19 tooth. In addition, there is a very tight limit on the size of the top pulley to preserve great shifting because the derailleur itself is not designed to handle much more. This is why you usually see a smaller top pulley and a bigger lower pulley.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Absolute Black carbon-ceramic Hollow Cage low friction upgrade\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail.jpg 1280w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail-297x186.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail-800x500.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail-120x75.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail-768x480.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail-696x435.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail-1068x668.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19061747/Absolute-Black-carbon-ceramic-Hollow-Cage-low-friction-upgrade_detail-672x420.jpg 672w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></a></p><p><strong>Are oversized derailleur pulleys appropriate for road and off-road use?</strong></p><p><strong>Kogel: </strong>Absolutely, yes!
