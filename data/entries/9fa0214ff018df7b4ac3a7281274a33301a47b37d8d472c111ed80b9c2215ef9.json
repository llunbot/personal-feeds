I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it on Twitter/X and Facebook, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><strong>DCR Posts In The Past Week:</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s all the latest posts on the site:</p>\n<p>Monday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/week-review-27th-2024.html\">Week in Review – Oct 27th, 2024</a><br />\nTuesday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/trainingpeaks-acquires-indievelo.html\">TrainingPeaks Acquires IndieVelo Indoor Cycling App</a><br />\nWednesday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/coros-review-amoled.html\">COROS Pace Pro In-Depth Review: Now With AMOLED and Maps!</a><br />\nSunday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/wahoo-teases-new-cycling-gps-also-expands-kickr-bike-features.html\">Wahoo Teases New Cycling GPS, Also Expands KICKR Bike Features</a><br />\nSunday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/fit-file-garmin-marq-damascus-coros-pace-pro-insta360-ace-pro.html\">FIT File: A $3000 Garmin and a $350 COROS walk into a bar…</a></p>\n<h3><strong>YouTube Videos This Week:</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s what hit the tubes over on the You of Tube; definitely don’t forget to subscribe there to get notified of videos the second they hit!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet:</p>\n<p><strong>1) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFxpvLLtW6Q\">Garmin removes USB from Edge x40 series:</a></strong> This move was bound to eventually happen, but I had sorta hoped Garmin wouldn’t dork with the x40 series. While there are a handful of positive reasons for MTP, for most people (or at least most techies), it’s a pain in the butt. It removes simple USB mass storage option, and makes it messier to access – especially for Mac people (which, is definitely Apple’s fault in this case). Shane walks through all the changes:</p>\n<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/retail-news/2024/10/30/rei-now-canyon-authorized-service-partner\">Canyon and REI team up to provide service support:</a></strong> Interesting tie-up, that makes a ton of sense. At present, Canyon isn’t selling any bikes through REI, but that’d also be super logical for popular models, especially as a way for the company to increase its footprint in the US:</p>\n<p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.eu.hammerhead.io/blogs/change-logs/karoo-software-build-version-1-516-1983\">Hammerhead Adds Karoo 3 Battery Saving Mode:</a></strong> This can extend the battery life up to 35+ hours, but there are some solid catches here. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnCfoyw4_34\">Shane also walked through</a> some of this situation as well. I’ll be digging into this separately and rolling it into my existing review in the coming weeks. Just didn’t have the time to dig into it this week, given all the other wearable and bike computer stuff in process.</p>\n<p><strong>4) <a href=\"https://www.pelobuddy.com/2024-peloton-hackathon/\">Peloton holds Hackathon, Interesting Outputs Result:</a> </strong>As always with Hackathons, this doesn’t mean any of these things will become actual consumer products, but rather, just ideas that were proofed out. Still, it’s super cool they do this.</p>\n<p><strong>5) <a href=\"https://escapecollective.com/what-i-learned-from-a-day-as-a-food-delivery-rider/\">A Day As A Food Delivery Cyclist:</a> </strong>There have been countless iterations of this over the years, but this is one of the better ones, focused a bit more on the safety and related realities of being a food delivery cyclist, from the perspective of someone in the cycling industry.</p>\n<p><strong>6) <a href=\"https://dronexl.co/2024/10/30/us-drone-maker-skydio-supply-chain-crisis-chinese-sanctions/\">On Tit-for-Tat Government Sanctions in the Drone World:</a> </strong>As I noted last week, the push to remove DJI from the US marketplace via various import bans is only going to get uglier. And this week, we see China reacting by zapping US drone maker Skydio’s battery manufacturer. Of course, the irony here being that as awesome as Skydio drones are, the company is by far the biggest driver of political influence against DJI in the US.</p>\n<p><strong>7) <a href=\"https://zwiftinsider.com/wahoo-firmware-20241028/\">Wahoo KICKR V6/Move/CORE Firmware Removes Virtual Shifting Power Bug:</a> </strong>This is a notable bug that popped up, which means you probably want to ensure your KICKR V6/Move/CORE has been updated. Or at least, your competitors probably hope you do.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"9fa0214ff018df7b4ac3a7281274a33301a47b37d8d472c111ed80b9c2215ef9","category":"Cycling"}
