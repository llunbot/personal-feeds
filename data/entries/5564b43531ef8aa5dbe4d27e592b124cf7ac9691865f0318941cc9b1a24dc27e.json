Around the clock, the plant sucks the heated water back up to power generators. Since last November, this carbon-free, Earth-borne power has been flowing onto a local grid in Nevada.</p>\n<p>Geothermal energy, though it’s continuously radiating from Earth’s super-hot core, has long been a relatively niche source of electricity, largely limited to volcanic regions like Iceland where hot springs bubble from the ground. But geothermal enthusiasts have dreamed of sourcing Earth power in places without such specific geological conditions—like Project Red’s Nevada site, developed by energy startup Fervo Energy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017050#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017050&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5564b43531ef8aa5dbe4d27e592b124cf7ac9691865f0318941cc9b1a24dc27e","category":"Tech"}
