The route isn’t set and that’s part of the fun! </em></p>\n<p><em>In this episode, we go over the rules and talk about the route.</em></p>\n<p><em>I don’t love planning, but every time I look at a map, I’m filled with excitement for the big ride! I’m starting on May 26 in Chicago and I’ll be publishing an episode every day– 10-20 minutes to share stories from the road.” – Lael Wilcox</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/lael-rides-around-the-world-podcast-episode-01/\">Lael Rides Around the World Podcast – Episode 01</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"54ce3e4bcc5adac26cf6f8796f9861463c0cabfc218b7b1faafade96bbd72354","category":"Cycling"}
