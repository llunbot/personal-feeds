{"title":"Deals: Anker Takes 50% Off the Eufy SmartDrop Package Box, Plus More Savings on Charging Accessories","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/23/deals-ankers-eufy-package-box/","date":1692801400000,"content":"Today we're tracking Anker accessory deals on Amazon and <a href=\"https://howl.me/cke1MBLrLCd\">on Anker's own website</a>. One highlight is the Eufy Security SmartDrop Package Box, which is down to <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB099ZNTGY1\"><strong>$199.99</strong></a> on Amazon, from $399.99. We last tracked this deal in July and it's a match of the all-time low price on the product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/anker-box.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon and Anker.

Right now it has an estimated delivery date of August 29 from Amazon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB099ZNTGY1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>50% OFF</div>Eufy SmartDrop Package Box for $199.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the SmartDrop Package Box there are a few other Anker accessories on sale today, both on Amazon and on Anker's website. <a href=\"https://howl.me/cke1MBLrLCd\">On the Anker website</a>, you'll find both individual deals on charging accessories as well as a few bundle offers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShoppers should note that for both websites, <strong>most of the deals below will require you to clip an on-page coupon</strong>. On Amazon, you can do this by simply clicking the box near the green text under the price of the accessory, and then you'll see the price at checkout. On Anker, you can hit the \"copy code\" button then proceed to \"buy now\" in order to get the discount.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBesides the Anker accessories, Jackery is also discounting its high-capacity Jackery Explorer 1000 Portable Power Station. This accessory is available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB083KBKJ8Q%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.1I6C1GZ5WKPY5%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.1I6C1GZ5WKPY5_1692800424855\"><strong>$799.00</strong></a>, down from $1,099.00.
