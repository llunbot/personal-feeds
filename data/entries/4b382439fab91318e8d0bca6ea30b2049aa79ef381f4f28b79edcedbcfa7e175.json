Both will be available on September 22. The 15 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB, the same starting price as last year's iPhone 14 Pro. The Pro Max technically gets a price hike, but only because Apple has axed the 128GB version—a 256GB iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199, the same price as the 256GB model from last year.</p>\n<p>The most noticeable change is a shift from a stainless steel frame to one made out of a brushed \"grade 5 titanium,\" which Apple says makes the phone more durable and lighter. The phone is also a little smaller than past models thanks to slimmer display bezels. The screen sizes stay the same—6.1 inches for the base model and 6.7 inches for the larger iPhone 15 Pro Max one. Apple didn't announce any changes to the phones' actual screens, so expect the same resolution, ProMotion refresh rate, and brightness as before.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964599#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964599&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b382439fab91318e8d0bca6ea30b2049aa79ef381f4f28b79edcedbcfa7e175","category":"Tech"}
