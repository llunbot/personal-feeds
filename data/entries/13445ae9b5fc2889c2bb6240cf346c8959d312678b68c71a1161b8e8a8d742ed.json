The battery can then be easily removed from the devices, with this new process considered to be easier than the adhesive pull tabs that are found under batteries in some previous iPhone models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis news seemingly confirms that the batteries in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus have metal enclosures, which should be revealed in teardowns soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, the electrically-induced battery removal process does not extend to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, according <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/heres-how-apple-is-making-iphone-16-more-repairable/\">to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt was previously reported that Apple was planning to make the batteries easier to remove in iPhone 16 models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/11/apple-makes-iphone-16-batteries-easier-to-replace/\">to comply with EU law</a>.
