The answers might be hiding in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/has-the-%E2%80%9Ctully-monster%E2%80%9D-mystery-finally-been-solved-after-75-years.1491586/\">tunicates</a>.</p>\n<p>Tunicates are filter-feeding invertebrates that include sea squirts and salps. The more common <a href=\"https://www.marinespecies.org/ascidiacea/#:~:text=Adult%20ascidians%20bear%20little%20resemblance,and%20a%20post%2Danal%20tail\">ascidiacean</a> species are sessile and attach to rocks or the seafloor, while the <a href=\"https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/zooplankton/image-key/appendicularia\">appendicularian</a> species swim freely. Yet all of them spawn as larvae that vaguely resemble tadpoles. Motile tunicates tend to grow into something that looks like a larger version of the larva. The others eventually faceplant onto a surface and absorb their own tails while morphing into a sessile, tubelike form with two siphons.</p>\n<p>Despite all this weirdness, there is now strong evidence that tunicates are the closest relatives to vertebrates, but a mystery still surrounds them. How did they evolve, and what did they evolve from? A 500 million-year-old fossil is now telling us more about the evolution of these peculiar life forms.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954196#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954196&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51063e997d89a8768ca371d64ab82927cddd8bfac84ab83dffc799c825864248","category":"Tech"}
