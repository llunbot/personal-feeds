Anthropic makes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/\">Claude</a>, an AI assistant rival to OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a>.</p>\n<p>One reason behind the deal involves chips. The computing demands of training large AI models have made access to specialized processors a requirement for AI companies. While <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/nvidias-dominance-puts-ai-industry-in-dire-danger-groups-warn-doj/\">Nvidia currently dominates</a> the AI chip market with customers that include most major tech companies, some cloud providers like Amazon have begun developing their own AI-specific processors.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Anthropic will train and deploy its foundation models using Amazon's custom-built <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/\">Trainium</a> (for training AI models) and its <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/\">Inferentia</a> chips (for AI inference, the term for running trained models). The company will also work with Amazon's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/annapurna-labs\">Annapurna Labs</a> division to advance processor development for AI applications.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/amazon-pours-another-4b-into-anthropic-openais-biggest-rival/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/amazon-pours-another-4b-into-anthropic-openais-biggest-rival/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6fddab0e68140d855f18dded87ca0d69ce16469e14fb0f9da3a4cf6e6c230b8f","category":"Tech"}
