While the researchers have confirmed all YubiKey 5 series models can be cloned, they haven’t tested other devices using the microcontroller, which is the SLE78 made by Infineon and successor microcontrollers known as the Infineon Optiga Trust M and the Infineon Optiga TPM. The researchers suspect that any device using any of these three microcontrollers and the Infineon cryptographic library contains the same vulnerability.</p>\n<h2>Patching not possible</h2>\n<p>YubiKey-maker Yubico issued an <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories-ysa-2024-03/\">advisory</a> in coordination with a <a href=\"https://ninjalab.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240903_eucleak.pdf\">detailed disclosure report</a> from NinjaLab, the security firm that reverse-engineered the YubiKey 5 series and devised the cloning attack. All YubiKeys running firmware prior to version 5.7—which was released in May and replaces the Infineon cryptolibrary with a custom one—are vulnerable. Updating key firmware on the YubiKey isn’t possible. That leaves all affected YubiKeys permanently vulnerable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046777#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046777&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5325ad247dcdbf4e6184bf9a3ed4dbd6d81ce05e45a1f406d120cc15f28478ed","category":"Tech"}
