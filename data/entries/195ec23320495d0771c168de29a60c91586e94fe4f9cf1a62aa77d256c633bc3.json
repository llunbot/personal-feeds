Previously, the SE was available in 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB variants. But the 256GB model is no longer available in Apple's online store.</p>\n<p>But don't take this to mean that the iPhone SE is going anywhere. In fact, analysts and journalists have published multiple similar reports claiming that the iPhone SE will get an upgrade early next year.</p>\n<p>The reports say that the 2022 iPhone SE will feature the Apple's A15 chip—the same one that's inside the newly announced iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPad mini. The phone would also feature 5G and have Qualcomm's X60 modem, according to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup\">Nikkei</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795930#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795930&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"195ec23320495d0771c168de29a60c91586e94fe4f9cf1a62aa77d256c633bc3","category":"Tech"}
