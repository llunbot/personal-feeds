{"title":"Dan Moren on Apple Books","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/08/apple-job-cuts-in-books-are-turning-the-page-in-the-wrong-direction/","date":1724861482000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sharing a little of my own data here: I’ve self-published my own\n<a href=\"https://dmoren.com/writing/short-stories/\">short stories</a> across most major ebook market places. Amazon\nmakes up the bulk of those downloads and sales — 53 percent and\n66 percent, respectively. Apple comes in a solid second place in\nsales, with 21 percent, and third place in downloads with 11\npercent. My literary agency has also published my novel <a href=\"https://dmoren.com/writing/all-souls-lost/\"><em>All\nSouls Lost</em></a> in ebook across those platforms, and Apple Books\nsales are also in second there, accounting for 18 percent of sales\nto 63 percent for Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect my numbers are probably skewed by the fact that my\naudience — that’s you all reading this, in large part — are\noverrepresented by users of Apple products. That said, to my eyes,\nApple has managed to achieve itself a comfortable, if distant\nsecond place in ebooks without really spending much in the way of\ntime and effort. Which perhaps explains why they’re looking to cut\ncosts and reduce focus — if the business works “fine” as is, then\nwhy invest more?</p>\n\n<p>My disappointment stems from the fact that Apple is better\npositioned and equipped than anyone else in the industry to take\non Amazon head-to-head in ebooks. But doing so would require the\ncompany to do something different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/28/moren-apple-books\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8b5c379be3e81ff00f900fed7d35a19f042edc932f8abc6514604e4493968b12","category":"Tech"}
