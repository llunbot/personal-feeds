Tesla CEO Elon Musk used Twitter to share the news last week, but it has now been <a href=\"https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml\">confirmed by the federal government</a> on its consumer-facing <a href=\"http://fueleconomy.gov\">fueleconomy.gov</a> site. However, given Tesla's lack of a communications department, it's unclear exactly what has changed that allows this electric vehicle to qualify once again.</p>\n<p>Until the end of 2022, the IRS offered a tax credit of up to $7,500 for qualifying plug-in vehicles. The size of the credit was based on battery capacity, and there was a provision to sunset the tax credit for a given manufacturer once it sold more than 200,000 plug-in vehicles. As Tesla only sells plug-in vehicles, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/tesla-sold-200000-cars-in-the-us-so-the-7500-tax-credit-is-going-away/\">it was the first to hit this cap</a>, reaching that milestone in the second quarter of 2018. (General Motors was the only other OEM to also pass this milestone; it did so <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/gm-sold-200000-electric-vehicles-by-q4-2018-reuters-source-says/\">at the end of 2018</a>.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-ev-tax-credit-for-2023/\">All that changed at the start of this year</a>, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now the tax credit applies to clean vehicles rather than plug-in vehicles, allowing a credit for hydrogen fuel cell EVs as well as plug-in hybrid and battery EVs. And there's no more sunset, and Tesla and GM vehicles are not disqualified due to sales success. As before, it's a tax credit, so the filer needs to have at least as large a tax liability as the credit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945670#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945670&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
