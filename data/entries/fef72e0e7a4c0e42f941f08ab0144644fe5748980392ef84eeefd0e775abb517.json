At the same time, PUSH announced the release of the brand new, U.S.-made VT/X shock, adding depth to its growing selection of rear suspension products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lower Prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new VT/X shock is arguably the bigger news, but the price drops are sure to interest a lot of riders who may have been put off by PUSH’s prices in the past. These price changes are relatively significant, too, which PUSH hopes will help increase demand and grow its customer base both at home and abroad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price reductions affect all of PUSH’s primary suspension products, including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/push-industries-nine-one-inverted-suspension-fork/\">Nine-One fork</a>, the Elevensix shock, and the SV-Eight shock. At present, the Nine-One inverted fork is listed on the PUSH website for $600 off at $2,000. The price of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/push-elevensix-s-series-coil-shock/\">Elevensix shock</a> is down from $1,600 to a more approachable $1,300 (including the spring and hardware). And the least expensive shock in the lineup, the SV-Eight, gets $200 more affordable at $665 (plus $115 for the spring and hardware).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PUSH-rear-shocks.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1184\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PUSH-rear-shocks.webp\" alt=\"Screenshot of PUSH's three rear shocks from the PUSH website\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PUSH-rear-shocks.webp 1184w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PUSH-rear-shocks-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PUSH-rear-shocks-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PUSH-rear-shocks-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>With the addition of the VT/X, PUSH now has three shocks in its rear suspension lineup.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>New VT/X Shock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the simpler and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/push-sv8-coil-shock-drops-a-valve-keeps-the-performance/\">more affordable SV-Eight</a> aims to be more of a set-it-and-forget-it shock, the more advanced, high-end Elevensix is custom-designed and tuned specifically for each bike model. The new VT/X fits roughly in the middle of those extremes, both in terms of price and complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PUSH claims the VT/X has a universal fit and great adjustability. It comes in trunnion and standard eyelets in a wide range of metric sizes and tunes. Riders choose their spring (+$95) and hardware kits (+$20) when purchasing the shock. The travel adjust feature gives each shock three stroke lengths with travel chips that adjust the stroke in 2.5 mm increments, should you need to adjust it to fit your bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VT/X uses PUSH’s 8.9 rear shock platform, which has tool-free external adjustments, 25 clicks of high and low speed compression, and 18 clicks of low speed rebound damping. Thus, there should be ample adjustability to dial in the ideal balance of support and plushness. Likewise, the Ascend Mode has 20 clicks of adjustment, so you can find the perfect blend of firmness and traction to suit your climbing preferences. PUSH’s patented Dual Valve Technology should ensure that those adjustments remain independent and don’t impact each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO.webp\" alt=\"the trunnion mount version of the PUSH VT/X shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trunnion-Eyelet-PUSH-VTX-ISO-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With tool-free external adjustments, making changes to the VT/X’s setting should be pretty user-friendly.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, like other PUSH shocks, the VT/X has an independent hydraulic bottom-out piston. This feature increases “<em>compression damping exponentially over the last 15% of travel to ensure safe supporting bottoming control when it counts</em>.” Bolstering durability to meet the demands of modern suspension designs and eMTBs, PUSH gave the VT/X a Melonite QPQ high-strength steel shaft with an oversized shaft eyelet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VT/X is U.S.-made with manufacturing and assembly taking place in-house in Colorado. The new shocks are also covered by PUSH’s Warranty Reset program. This one-year warranty program resets after an annual service by a PUSH Factory Authorized Service Center, extending the factory warranty for another year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PUSH VT/X: Pricing and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The VT/X shock goes for $865 for the damper only. Riders will also need to purchase the appropriate PUSH HyperCoil spring for $95, as well as the correct size PUSH Mount Kit for $20 to complete the package. That brings the total price up to $980 before taxes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VT/X shock and the other PUSH suspension products (now with lower prices!) are available now through the PUSH website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pushindustries.com/\">pushindustries.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/push-industries-lowers-prices-launches-new-vt-x-shock/\">Push Industries Lowers Prices, Launches New VT/X Shock</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"fef72e0e7a4c0e42f941f08ab0144644fe5748980392ef84eeefd0e775abb517","category":"Cycling"}
