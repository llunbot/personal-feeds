In the case of AVG Internet Security for Mac, what has long been a heavily marketed package proves to be worth its salt, albeit at a somewhat steep price for what’s on the table. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AVG Internet Security is easy enough to <a href=\"https://www.avg.com/en-us/internet-security-for-mac#mac\" target=\"_blank\">download from the AVG website</a>, and the software is available as a free download once an AVG account has been set up and a credit or debit card has been saved on file. AVG Internet Security is currently available at a 57% discounted subscription rate as of this writing, and is available as a 60-day free trial with $0 due at checkout for the free tier, $3.89/£2.79 a month for 1 Mac ($46.68/£33.49 for the first year, then $77.99/£59.99 a year), or $4.99/£4.17 a month for 10 devices ($59.88/£49.99 for the first year, then $99.99/£84.99 a year renewal price). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The software, which requires macOS 13 (High Sierra) or later to install and run, is available as a 60-day trial period before billing begins, downloads and installs easily, and once permissions have been assigned to your entire hard drive, you’re good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Find out how AVG Internet Security compares to other <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668850/best-mac-antivirus-software.html\">Mac Antivirus options</a> in our round-up of the best.

The software, combined with macOS’s Gatekeeper functionality, headed off the vast majority of sample malware installations off at the pass, quarantining them quickly and preventing installation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scans on external drives and specific folders are easy to set up and execute, the scheduling feature works well, the software can set up location configurations as you travel, and there are enough customization options for network security, albeit you’ll find more in a dedicated package. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AVG8-Locating-and-removing-malware-on-an-external-drive.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"AVG8 Locating and removing malware on an external drive\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AVG8-Locating-and-removing-malware-on-an-external-drive.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1007w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AVG8-Locating-and-removing-malware-on-an-external-drive.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AVG8-Locating-and-removing-malware-on-an-external-drive.jpeg?resize=768%2C516&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AVG8-Locating-and-removing-malware-on-an-external-drive.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1007\" height=\"676\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Locating and removing malware on an external drive.</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tests with malware and phishing-based websites went well. The software prevented questionable external code from being loaded on suspect websites and blocked phishing sites from loading. It provides warnings when you’re about to click into a website that offers access to a package delivery you don’t remember ordering that somehow got lost, for which the sender needs your personal information to get it along…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few places for improvement with AVG Internet Security for Mac, but not many. During testing, the software was able to route out and quarantine an impressive array of software, but still allowed a fake version of Adobe Flash Player to be installed. This software was eventually removed via macOS about 20 minutes later after a menu to uninstall it appeared. You can still override the macOS Gatekeeper and AVG security features and install malware such as Genio if you’re determined to do so, albeit AVG Internet Security does a good job of removing these following later scans. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/avg-9-phishing-website-blocked.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"avg 9 phishing website blocked\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/avg-9-phishing-website-blocked.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 628w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/avg-9-phishing-website-blocked.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/avg-9-phishing-website-blocked.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"628\" height=\"417\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If there’s one thing I might change about the software, it’s the fact that while the scheduled scan feature is reliable, it doesn’t activate a main window to readily display that the scan is taking place, and there are both pros and cons to this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy AVG Internet Security for Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some small fixes aside, AVG Internet Security for Mac stands on its own, catches an impressive amount of viral, phishing, and malware activity for a consumer package, and does its job well, all while wrapped in a bright, friendly user interface that’s easy to navigate. Granted, given the subscription pricing and packages, a VPN client wouldn’t be out of the question, and the price point for a single device moves into questionable territory, but the software still performs well, travels well with its location settings, and this is appreciated. A little more for the money is never a bad idea, but AVG Internet Security straddles this line and is worth your consideration as a consumer package. Have a look at its 60-day trial to see what works, what doesn’t, and what might be right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e203ad94fe6ec0112464179c839361f52c8e03cf1e5f52c2c80e5176eafc1c5c","category":"Apple"}
