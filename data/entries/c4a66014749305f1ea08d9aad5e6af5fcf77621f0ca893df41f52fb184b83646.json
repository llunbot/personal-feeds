{"title":"Halo and Destiny developer Bungie reboots classic FPS franchise Marathon","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941819","date":1684967441000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p><em>Marathon</em> trailer. </p></div>\n<p>It's been more than 25 years since the last game in the storied Marathon first-person shooter franchise came out, but developer Bungie is (sort of) returning to its roots by rebooting the IP with a new game simply titled <a href=\"https://www.marathonthegame.com/y3vmGPNRxH3RNTqLkq5PFXZy\"><em>Marathon</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The game was revealed as a PlayStation 5 title in a short cinematic trailer during Sony's not-E3 \"PlayStation Showcase\" stream Wednesday afternoon. That said, it is also coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S. Bungie says it will support cross-play and cross-save between those platforms, just like the developer's current flagship title, <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>\n<p>The cross-platform nature of it wasn't a foregone conclusion though, as Sony closed an acquisition of Bungie in July 2022. This is Bungie's first non-<em>Destiny</em> title in 13 years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941819#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941819&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c4a66014749305f1ea08d9aad5e6af5fcf77621f0ca893df41f52fb184b83646","category":"Tech"}
