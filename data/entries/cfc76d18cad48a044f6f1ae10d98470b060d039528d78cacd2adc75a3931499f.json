(photo/MAHLE)\" /></p>\n<p>For the past few years, MAHLE SmartBike Systems has made a name for itself producing lightweight e-bike motors, including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/worlds-lightest-mahle-x20-e-bike-drive-system/\">X20 hub drive motor system</a>. As one of the lightest and most compact e-bike motors on the market, the MAHLE X20 has proven to be a popular choice for <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scott-addict-eride-is-worlds-lightest-e-bike-mahle-x20/\">lightweight e-road</a> and e-gravel bikes, with brands like Scott, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wilier-filante-hybrid-aero-road-e-bike/\">Willier</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-orbea-gain-x20-road-gravel-ebikes/\">Orbea</a>, and more using the unobtrusive system.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, MAHLE enters the eMTB market with the launch of the M40, its first full-power mid-drive motor. This complete e-bike drive system includes the powerful M40 mid-drive motor, two battery size options, a top tube-integrated display, and a wireless handlebar remote. By the looks of it, the MAHLE M40 is ready for action and poised to take on the more established mid-drive competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>MAHLE M40 Motor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the e-bike motor power wars have been heating up with the DJI Avinox, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-specialized-levo-4-emtb-boast-up-to-111nm-of-super-power-control-genie-adjustability/\">Specialized’s new 3.1 motor</a>, and the upcoming power-boosting <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-performance-line-cx-r-motor-cx-motors-power-torque-app-update/\">update to the Bosch Performance Line CX</a> taking power and torque to new heights. MAHLE appears to be jumping right into the fray with the M40, which boasts an impressive 105 Nm of torque and a peak power of 850 W. For reference, those power specs match those of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dji-avinox-105nm-ebike-motor-evolves-drone-tech-into-mega-power-at-2-5kg-lightweight/\">DJI Avinox</a>, making the new M40 one of the most powerful options available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M40 Motor Specs</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Torque:</strong> 105 Nm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Peak Power:</strong> 850 W</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Motor Weight:</strong> 2.5 kg</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Power‑to‑Weight Ratio: </strong>340 W/kg</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Support Ratio:</strong> up to 400 %</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1.webp\" alt=\"The Mahle M40 motor on an electric mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Drive-unit-1-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>MAHLE’s first mid-drive motor looks quite polished and ready for action.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a claimed 2.5 kg for the motor, the weight of the M40 is also nearly identical to that of the DJI Avinox, making it one of the lightest full-power drive systems on the market. According to MAHLE, the multi-sensor system uses its flagship speed sensor capable of “<em>detecting speed variations within less than 3 cm</em>.” That works alongside cadence and torque sensors to provide “<em>a powerful yet natural riding experience with strong controlled support that adapts seamlessly to every riding situation.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional motor functions include what MAHLE calls Motor Dynamic Overrun. This reportedly “<em>reduces the braking effect of the motor and enables a smooth overrun after pedaling</em>.” The Hill Brake sounds like a useful feature with an “Auto-Hold” that can prevent the bike from rolling back when stopped on a steep incline.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1.webp\" alt=\"The full M40 system includes the motor, remote, display, charger, and two sizes of batteries.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1.webp 1620w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sistema-M40-1-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The complete MAHLE M40 drive system includes two sizes of batteries that share the same shape (different length, obviously) and connections for interchangeability.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>MAHLE M40 Batteries</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand claims that one of the standout features of the M40 motor is its “o<em>ptimized energy consumption, particularly at high support levels</em>.” MAHLE says this enables the use of smaller batteries, which provides brands with more design freedom and results in lighter, nimbler bikes. MAHLE is offering two sizes of new 48V batteries, which they claim are developed and manufactured in Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the two battery options, the iM5 Battery is smaller with 534 Wh of capacity. MAHLE says that the iM5 battery and M40 motor together weigh just 5 kg, “<em>making it one of the lightest combinations on the market</em>.” The iM8 battery has 800 Wh of capacity, allowing for a range of up to 150 km or 2,500 m of vertical gain. MAHLE says the batteries are fast charging and that both sizes are identical in shape (but varying in length) and connections, making it possible to swap between the two depending on your needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"The Mahle Trio wireless handlebar remote for the M40 drive system.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trio.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"The Head Unit+ display for the M40 drive system.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HU-1.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The Trio remote and the Head Unit+ display for the M40 drive system.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>MAHLE M40 Display and Remote</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Head Unit+ display looks similar to many of the more advanced top-tube-integrated units that are becoming increasingly common. The 1.9-inch color screen looks clear and easy to read while showing relevant ride information. MAHLE says it is customizable and “updatable and can be expanded with future functionalities and improvements.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wireless Trio Remote looks similar to other handlebar-mounted remotes from brands like Bosch or Specialized. It appears to tuck in discreetly next to the left grip with an intuitive button layout that makes it easy to change to assist modes while you ride. MAHLE also states that its digital ecosystem supports connectivity between your bike, smartphone, laptop, or Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie.webp\" alt=\"A mountain biker doing a wheelie across a field on a bike using the Mahle m40 drive system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mahle-m40-wheelie-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With specs rivaling the DJI Avinox, we might see the MAHLE M40 on bikes in the near future.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>MAHLE M40: Pricing and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With weight and power specs rivaling the highly acclaimed DJI Avinox motor, the MAHLE M40 seems like it could potentially become a disruptor in the electric mountain bike market. Like any other e-bike drive system, however, it is not sold separately and can only be purchased on a complete eMTB (or frame) that has been specifically designed around it. It remains to be seen which, if any, major brands choose to use the M40 motor, but MAHLE included a list of launch partners, all of which are smaller brands incorporating the M40 into new bike designs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given MAHLE’s existing relationships with many mainstream brands through its X20 hub-drive motor, it certainly seems like a possibility that we’ll see the M40 drive system on more bikes in the near future. Which brands and when remain to be seen, but we’ll keep you posted when we know more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://mahle-smartbike.com/m40/\">mahle-smartbike.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mahle-enters-the-emtb-market-with-powerful-new-m40-mid-drive-motor/\">MAHLE Enters The eMTB Market With Powerful New M40 Mid-Drive Motor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cfc76d18cad48a044f6f1ae10d98470b060d039528d78cacd2adc75a3931499f","category":"Cycling"}
