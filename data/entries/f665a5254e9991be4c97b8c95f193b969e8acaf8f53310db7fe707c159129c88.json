This year, for the first time, the premium US brand equips a pro team from head to toe – or more accurately tyre to bar – with its equipment.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The TotalEnergies UCI ProTeam team have lost <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/peter-sagan-announced-retirement#:~:text=I%27ve%20decided%20that%20I,serving%20as%20his%20final%20objective.\">Peter Sagan, who has retired</a> from top-flight road racing, and with him bike sponsor Specialized, but they have gained what might now be the most envied (pun intended) bike in the pack.</span></p>\n<p><span>James Startt photographed the bike of TotalEnergies’ Alan Jousseaume at the four-day Tour de la Provence at the beginning of February.</span></p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"The down tube of TotalEnergies' Enve Melee frame\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Totale_Energies_Enve06_Rouleur_02_20242K.jpg?v=1708518253\" />The Melee frame is the centrepiece, developed after Enve’s first foray into framebuilding with the US-made Custom Road. <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/desire-journal/enve-launches-its-new-melee-road-racing-bike\">The Melee, launched in 2022</a>, takes its design cues from the Custom Road according to Enve, but instead of customisation it prioritises “efficiency and speed”. It is a monocoque that's Asian made, with Enve clearly prioritising those two characteristics for its manufacturing too.</span></p>\n<p><span>The frame, which has a claimed weight of 850g, was developed to be fastest with <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/desire-journal/real-world-fast-enve-launches-its-new-ses-wheels-line\">Enve’s own SES wheels</a>, with its tube shapes designed to work best with the Enve rim shapes – a compatibility that’s highly valued by pro teams. Enve has a long history of being at the cutting edge of aerodynamic design, first working with British F1 engineer Simon Smart in 2009.<img alt=\"TotalEnergies Enve Melee bike from the front\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Totale_Energies_Enve08_Rouleur_02_20242K.jpg?v=1708518787\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>Something that raised eyebrows when the Melee was unveiled was its tyre clearance: space for 35mm rubber seemed at odds with the “speed” part of Enve’s claim – granted that wide tubeless tyres are generally more efficient. Although tyre clearance even for the most speed-orientated race bikes has been gradually increasing, even the brand new Factor Ostro VAM only has room for 32mm.</span></p>\n<p><span>The frame the team will be using is of course – in accordance with UCI regulations – exactly the same that Enve customers can buy for £5,500 and comes in seven sizes and five fork rakes. At the moment just the colourway – the black with sky-blue highlights that has been up for grabs since Team Sky became Team Ineos – is exclusive to the team, with the consumer version coming only in the silver ‘Damascus’ for the time being.<img alt=\"Enve bar and stem\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Totale_Energies_Enve04_Rouleur_02_20242K.jpg?v=1708518531\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>The team can choose between one-piece or two-piece front ends: Jousseaume has opted for the </span><span>Integrated Aero Stem and SES AR Handlebar – which completely conceals the cables as the one-piece cockpit does. It has a -7° rise and comes in lengths up to 130mm. Jousseaume has gone long, as most pros do, but unlike many of his counterparts, isn’t running it completely slammed. The 25-year-old Frenchman, who is 1m 77cm tall, is a puncheur/climber and clearly prefers the slightly more upright position for the mountains – though it’s still an aggressive position.<img alt=\"Enve SES 4.5 wheel with white Enve decal\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Totale_Energies_Enve05_Rouleur_02_20242K.jpg?v=1708518614\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>As for the wheels, Jousseaume is running Enve SES 4.5s, the second deepest option that the team have available to them but which still have a sub-1,500g claimed weight. The choice is between the US-made SES models that include the 2.3, 3.4, 4.5, and 6.7 – there’s a wheel for every type of parcours and wind condition.</span></p>\n<p><span>The tyres are Enve SES tubeless 29mm and feature a little ‘Race Day’ logo with a chequered flag that suggests a pro team edition which, like the legendary Continental Competition Pro LTD tubular, probably isn't readily available at your local bike shop.</span></p>\n<p><span>As you’d expect, Enve’s tyres are wind tunnel tested and feature a more accentuated tread pattern towards the outsides, designed to turbulate the airflow so that it doesn’t separate from the rim.<img alt=\"Selle Italian SRL Boost Kit Carbon saddle\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Totale_Energies_Enve09_Rouleur_02_20242K.jpg?v=1708518704\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>The only part of the bike apart from the groupset and bottle cages that isn’t made by Enve is the saddle – a Selle Italia Flite Boost Kit Carbonio. Why no Enve saddle? Enve has in the past partnered with Selle Italia but at the moment there’s no link-up for TotalEnergies.<img alt=\"TotalEnergies Enve Melee bottles and bottle cages\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Totale_Energies_Enve03_Rouleur_02_20242K.jpg?v=1708518880\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>Even though Enve currently produces two bottle cages, TotalEnergies is using Tacx Deva cages and Shiva bottles bearing the name of Tacx’s parent company, Garmin.</span></p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"Shimano Dura-Ace drivetrain on a TotalEnergies Enve Melee bike\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Totale_Energies_Enve02_Rouleur_02_20242K.jpg?v=1708519027\" />Jousseaume is running 54/40 chainrings with the Shimano Dura-Ace 9200 chainset – the bigger chainrings are favoured more frequently by pro riders now that 12-speed cassettes offer a broader spread of ratios without the fear of running out of gears at either end. The pedals are also Dura-Ace.</span></p>\n<p><span>Jousseaume was a DNF at Tour de La Provence, but this is just the start of Enve's journey in professional racing.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"f665a5254e9991be4c97b8c95f193b969e8acaf8f53310db7fe707c159129c88","category":"Cycling"}
