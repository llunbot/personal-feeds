The other signatories, a majority of whom were engineers, declined to publicly disclose their names because they did not want to jeopardize employment at Blue Origin or harm their prospects in the aerospace industry for other jobs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799633#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799633&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"50b3711b371cb1dbb610fdf2c198251008ea76b16f2bc9d2be522af3992a97fe","category":"Tech"}
