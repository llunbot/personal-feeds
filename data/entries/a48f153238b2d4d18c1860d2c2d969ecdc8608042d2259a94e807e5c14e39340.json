only available aftermarket as separate bars and stems, so the new US-made SES AR One-Piece is a new, sleeker, more aero offering for the fast gravel/all-road rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design includes a compound flare to the bar, with the upper part of the bend vertical, while the lower 50mm flares out at 18 degrees. This means that the brake levers are in a standard position, rather than the sometimes-uncomfortable outward angled position they adopt on some flared gravel bike bars, which was outlawed by the UCI this winter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to many other integrated cabling systems, the Enve In-Route routing system feeds the brake hoses and – if they’re there – electronic shifting wires through the stem and into the front of the headset spacers, then down into the bike’s frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"Enve SES AR cockpit\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/ENV-AR-InRoute-OnePiece-01-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Enve</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the SES AR One-Piece bar/stem fits the range of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/enve\" target=\"_blank\">Enve</a> bikes, only a limited number of third party frame-makers have adopted Enve’s system.
