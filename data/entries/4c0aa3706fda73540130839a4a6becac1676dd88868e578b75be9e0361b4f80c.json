The first iOS 17.1 beta landed for developers on September 27, 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1961587/ios-17-features-not-available-at-launch-september-2023.html\">big iOS 17 features are scheduled for release this fall</a>, so they’ll come in these updates. Collaborative playlists in Apple Music, the new Journal app, PDF form autofill, NameDrop to Apple Watch, and more are all on the way. What’s more, Apple often makes some interface tweaks and adds minor unannounced features in these updates, so the first few iOS 17 updates are worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 10/17/23:</strong> The release candidate of iOS 17.1 is now available.

The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">process for installing a beta</a> has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click Sign Up on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/&amp;xcust=1-1-1674501-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/1674501/ios-16-5-features-sports-news-siri-install.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Beta page</a> and register with your Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in to the Beta Software Program.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Enroll your iOS device</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the Settings app, tap <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the <em>Beta Updates</em> section, select the <em>iOS Public Beta</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in <em>Software Update</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public beta test for iOS 17 started on July 12, and we suggest most users wait for it–as buggy as public betas can be, the early developer betas of major new OS releases are often even more error-prone and incomplete.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.1: How to install the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. Beginning with iOS 17, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the Apple Developer App <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-developer/id640199958&amp;xcust=1-1-671198-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\" target=\"_blank\">from the App Store</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to sell applications to the App Store you’ll need to pay $99/£79 per year for a paid account. Sign up to the Apple Developer Program (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/&amp;xcust=1-1-671198-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">here</a>) or through Apple’s Developer App. You can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/&amp;xcust=1-1-671198-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\" target=\"_blank\">compare the free and paid accounts here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some developers have an Apple ID registered for developer access that is different from the Apple ID associated with their personal Apple account and data. To use a different Apple ID for beta access than is used throughout the rest of iOS, open <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> &gt; <em>Beta Updates</em> and select the Apple ID at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about iOS 17 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17 superguide</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4c0aa3706fda73540130839a4a6becac1676dd88868e578b75be9e0361b4f80c","category":"Apple"}
