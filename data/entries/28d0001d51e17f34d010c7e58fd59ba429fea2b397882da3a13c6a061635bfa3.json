The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/pro-cycling-and-racing\" target=\"_blank\">pro cycling</a> has been ramping up in frequency, with Marianne Vos winning Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Wout van Aert victorious at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-log-marianne-vos-omloop-het-nieuwsblad\" target=\"_blank\">both on their debuts</a>, can you imagine?).

from OluKai are created for everyday casual wear. They’re lightweight with a mesh design for breathability and feel ideal for being on the go. I wear them when I’m walking my sister’s dog, Ozzy, through non-muddy areas and they’ve been nice to wear and good to my feet thus far. But that’s not Ozzy pictured above, that’s actually Apollo, my other sister’s dog. The trainers are easy to slip on and off – not only ideal because I hate bending down to take shoes off, but something I think could benefit those with bad backs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Robyn-In-the-Drops-trainers-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OluKai is a brand inspired by Hawaii, its founder being born there, but has headquarters in California and does not manufacture in Hawaii.

Donna Tartt’s <em>The Secret History</em> had been on my list for a while – it’s over 500 pages, I wanted to take the time for it – and I loved it so much. The book is brilliantly written with interesting characters, and with it being from 1992, might make you sound academic should you bring it up in conversation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> is next on my to-read list (I haven’t seen the TV series so no spoilers), and I’m also looking to read more non-fiction self-help books. <em>The Mountain is You</em> by Brianna Wiest is about self-sabotage and how to stop those behaviours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next time!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/olukai-trainers\">In the Drops: OluKai trainers, Barebells Coco Choco bars and reading books</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"28d0001d51e17f34d010c7e58fd59ba429fea2b397882da3a13c6a061635bfa3","category":"Cycling"}
