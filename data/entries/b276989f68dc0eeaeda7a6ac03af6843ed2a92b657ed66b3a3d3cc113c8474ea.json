Gurman is expecting new Mac hardware to be unveiled during Apple's keynote on June 5, including an all-new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/gurman-15-inch-macbook-air-wwdc/\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> model. \"Read into that as you will,\" he added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced the ‌Mac Studio‌ in May 2022, offering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-ultra/\">M1 Ultra</a> chip configurations. Despite the launch of a range of Macs with the ‌M2‌, ‌M2‌ Pro, and ‌M2‌ Max chips, Apple has not yet refreshed the ‌Mac Studio‌. Gurman believes that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/new-mac-studio-models-planned-gurman/\">two new Mac Studio models are in the works</a>, but is unsure of when they will launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe has previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/21/no-apple-silicon-mac-pro-wwdc/\">cast doubt</a> over the possibility of update being announced at WWDC, suggesting that Apple is more likely to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/05/apple-may-not-launch-m2-ultra-mac-studio/\">wait until the M3 generation</a> to update the ‌Mac Studio‌ as to avoid cannibalizing the Apple silicon <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>. Even so, updated ‌Mac Studio‌ models with ‌M2‌ Max and ‌M2‌ Ultra chip options are not out of the question for WWDC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ and MacBook Pro models with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a> chip are also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/new-macbook-airs-with-m3-chip-report/\">rumored to be in development</a>, but the first ‌M3‌ Macs are not expected to launch until toward the end of the year. As such, Gurman's latest information about new Mac trade-ins does not necessarily that indicate direct successors for all of the aforementioned devices are on the immediate horizon. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wwdc-2023/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/apple-to-accept-trade-ins-for-new-macs-at-wwdc/\">Gurman: Apple to Begin Accepting Trade-Ins for Three New Mac Models on Day of WWDC Keynote</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-to-begin-accepting-trade-ins-for-three-new-mac-models-on-day-of-wwdc-keynote.2390724/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b276989f68dc0eeaeda7a6ac03af6843ed2a92b657ed66b3a3d3cc113c8474ea","category":"Apple"}
