The decision by Warren Buffett's conglomerate came as a surprise to many, given Buffett's long-standing endorsement of the company. The move was part of a broader strategy by Berkshire to raise its cash position to a record $277 billion, indicating a cautious approach towards the current economic environment and concern about the technology sector's resilience. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" technology companies in the United States (Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla) today collectively lost nearly $900 billion in market value due primarily due to concern about their volatility. Nvidia experienced a sharp decline of over 8% following reports of delays for its next-generation AI chips. Amazon and Microsoft also saw their shares tumble by 8.3% and 5%, respectively, amid growing concerns about the reliability and profitability of their cloud computing services.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, some analysts still see cause for optimism about Apple's position in the market. In its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/apple-q3-2024-earnings-takeaways/\">most recent earnings report</a>, Apple detailed a steep increase in services revenue at $24.2 billion, up from $21.2 billion a year ago. The introduction of Apple Intelligence later this year is also expected to support growth.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-leads-tech-sector-market-loss/\">Apple Leads Tech Sector's Massive $900 Billion Market Loss</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-leads-tech-sectors-massive-900-billion-market-loss.2432971/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dbd7421f62448b8e72af063f17e5b77ef37210e7a70127cb226be84c856eff28","category":"Apple"}
