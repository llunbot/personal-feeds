(credit: Andrew Cunningham)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Big news for the assuredly huge pool of Linux users who also love Microsoft's software: Microsoft has <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/11/02/edge-ignite-nov-2021/\">released the first stable version</a> of the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser for Linux. The move follows about a year of early availability in the Dev and Beta channels and nearly two years of stable-channel availability for Windows and macOS.</p>\n\n<p>The Linux version of Edge is compatible with most major distributions. Microsoft offers both .deb and .rpm installers (for Debian and Red Hat-based distributions, respectively) <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?r=1\">on its download page</a>, and the browser can also be installed via the command line or your package manager of choice.</p>\n<p>In our brief testing of the stable version of Edge running on Linux Mint, the browser seems to offer most of the same features as Edge running on Windows or macOS, including syncing for passwords, extensions, bookmarks, and open tabs. If you're a Linux user who has to use Windows for work, it's handy to have a version of the browser that can sync that data back and forth. The Linux version of Edge lacks the Internet Explorer compatibility mode (also missing from the Mac version) that some businesses use to get around updating outdated internal websites, but most of the other features seem to be here.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809554#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809554&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"218cbc7bce07eafb4807872199ac550132c18b8c96f6f276a64521893fc395d6","category":"Tech"}
