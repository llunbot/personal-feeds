Now in its fifth generation, Liv says the new Avail Advanced has been re-engineered for “the smoothest, most efficient riding experience” and cycling long distances.</p>\n<p>Behind this claim are the two new framesets for the Avail Advanced Pro and the more affordable Avail Advanced, alongside a handlebar and seatpost designed to minimise vibrations and room to fit 700x38mm tyres.</p>\n<p>The new range features five bikes, opening with the Liv Avail Advanced 3 costing £2,299/€2,400 and extending up to the Liv Avail Advanced Pro 0 for £5,999/$6,500.</p>\n<h2>Two new framesets</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Liv Avail Advanced Pro 0.\" title=\"LIV AVAIL\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Liv Avail Advanced Pro 0 features the top-spec frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Joy / Liv</i></span></div>\n<p>Liv says the redesigned Avail Advanced Pro and Avail Advanced frames feature high-performance grade raw carbon fibre.</p>\n<p>The front triangles are moulded using “a proprietary manufacturing process called Modified Monocoque Construction”.</p>\n<p>The frames are said to have new tube shapes and “dynamic feature lines”. These are intended to embody the Avail’s new design identity, which Liv describes as “Vitality”.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Liv Avail Advanced collage showing fork and head tube.\" title=\"Liv Avail 2024\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Liv has redesigned the Avail Advanced’s fork and increased tyre clearance to 700x38mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Joy / Liv</i></span></div>\n<p>The framesets use different forks. The Avail Advanced has an Advanced Grade Composite fork and the Avail Advanced Pro frameset an Advanced SL-Grade Composite fork.</p>\n<p>The Advanced SL-Grade Composite Fork optimises strength and stiffness, and “boosts your climbing abilities”, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>Both forks are said to handle shock absorption at the front of the bike, while the slim, dropped seatstays are claimed to introduce vertical compliance “to effectively dampen road shocks and vibrations from the rear wheel”.</p>\n<p>The frames also share an oversized bottom bracket area, which integrates an 86mm-wide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a>.</p>\n<p>Liv says asymmetrical chainstays provide additional stiffness on the driveside and stability on the non-driveside. The frames and forks use flat-mount <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a> with 12mm thru-axles front and rear.</p>\n<h2>Efficiency and stiffness claims</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Woman riding Liv Avail Advanced.\" title=\"LIV AVAIL\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Liv says the Avail Advanced Pro has a 19 per cent improvement in stiffness transmission efficiency.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Joy / Liv</i></span></div>\n<p>Regular readers of BikeRadar will know brands often claim their latest bikes outperform their older models, but with data to back up such statements proving elusive.</p>\n<p>For the launch of the new Avail Advanced range, Liv has bucked the trend by providing insights into why its latest bikes are more efficient and stiffer than their predecessors.</p>\n<p>The Avail Advanced Pro has a 19 per cent stiffness transmission efficiency, while the Advanced has an 8.2 per cent improvement in efficiency. Liv says the stiffness of the bikes was assessed using the protocol outlined by the German cycling magazine <em>Tour</em>.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

Slender seatstays introduce vertical compliance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Joy / Liv</i></span></div>\n<p>Liv tested medium framesets and says its testing determined how much the complete framesets flexed torsionally under load.</p>\n<p>It states that increased frame stiffness means better power transmission as well as improved cornering.</p>\n<p>Both framesets are said to weigh less than their predecessors.</p>\n<p>The Avail Advanced Pro frameset is claimed to weigh 128.4g less, while the Avail Advanced loses a claimed 104.9g.</p>\n<p>Combining the stiffness results and weight savings leads Liv to conclude that the Advanced Pro has a 30.18 per cent improvement in its stiffness-to-weight ratio, while the Advanced sees an 16.21 per cent improvement.</p>\n<p>Liv also states the Avail Advanced Pro is 7.12 per cent more efficient than the new Avail Advanced.</p>\n<h2>D-Fuse technology</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

new Avail Advanced models.</p>\n<p>D-Fuse technology was first introduced in 2014 for cyclocross bikes, and is now used across Liv’s range, including <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes/\">endurance bikes</a>, such as the Avail.</p>\n<p>The Liv Contact SLR and SL D-Fuse handlebars use lightweight carbon and are tailored to women’s hands with ergonomic D-shaped tubes and an 8-degree flare.</p>\n<p>Live says the handlebars improve comfort across different terrain and have “increased pulling stiffness” for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-improve-your-sprinting/\">sprinting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-become-a-hill-climbing-star/\">climbing</a>.</p>\n<p>The D-Fuse SLR and SL seatposts offer up to 7m of flex to act as a shock absorber, according to Liv.</p>\n<h2>Aero stems</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img

facilitate aero integration, hiding cables and hoses from the wind.</p>\n<p>The Avail Advanced Pro uses the new Contact SL AeroLight Stem, which enables you to route cables beneath and inside the steam.</p>\n<p>Liv says the design enables you to incorporate extra cable length so you can adjust the height of your handlebar without worrying about short cables.</p>\n<p>The Contact SL AeroLight Stem is also said to streamline aerodynamics by integrating the stem cap, spacers and head tube, as well as aligning the face plate with the Contact SL D-Fuse <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">handlebar</a>.</p>\n<p>The Avail Advanced has the new Contact Aerolight Stem, which is said to
