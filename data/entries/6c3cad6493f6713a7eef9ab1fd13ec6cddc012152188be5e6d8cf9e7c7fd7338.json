It's not clear if other banks in Morocco will be coming on board with support for Apple's digital payment method, but it's likely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe support means that CIH Bank's customers will be able to add their Mastercard credit cards and bank cards to the Wallet app by tapping the plus button in the top-right corner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to update its regional website to officially confirm the launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEver since its launch in the United States in 2014, ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌ has slowly expanded to more countries worldwide while at the same time expanding the list of financial institutions that support the feature. ‌‌Apple Pay‌‌‌ can be used anywhere contactless payments are accepted with a compatible <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch.
