Filling out that frame is a shield-type spherical mirrored polycarbonate lens with a brown base and light mirror coating. Non-slip bits at the nosepiece and the ends of the arms promise a secure fit.</p><p>Adidas is limiting production to just 150 pieces, all of which will be available through the brand’s website starting August 23, 2021, but only to members of the Adidas “Creator Club”.</p><p>Oh, and you’re wondering what these might cost? That’d be a whopping US$415 / £300 / €350 (sorry, Australia, no soup for you). </p><p>More information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.adidas.com</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"James Huang","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f469fed9c54bf863296f993f0815f5bcd0dacda6e49808969d6e07bcf9c1bd69","category":"Cycling"}
