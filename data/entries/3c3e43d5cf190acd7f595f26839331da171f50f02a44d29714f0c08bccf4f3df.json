Weighing just under 15.5kg, the Diodra S3 is built around an EU-made laminated bamboo frame paired to an all-in-one motor &amp; battery in the rear hub, with either Gates belt or conventional chain drive. And for riders looking for an even lighter pedal-powered runabout, there’s a regular M8 commuter bike option with an Alfine internally-geared rear hub instead of a hub motor…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Diodra S3 lightweight, simple bamboo ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Diodra S3 lightweight simple bamboo ebike, made-in-EU, city commuter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_European-city-commuter-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Diodra)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed and manufactured in Romania, Diodra isn’t precisely a start-up. Instead, it’s the latest evolution of a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=bamboo\" target=\"_blank\">bamboo</a> commuter bike project that’s been brewing since around 2018. Previously under the name Veltra bikes with rim brakes. The concept remains, but the bikes have become much more refined in this latest iteration. What you get now is a simple single-speed disc brake frame made primarily from laminated bamboo frame, with split stays that you run a belt or chain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, all you have to do is pick either ebike or bike. From either the self-contained ebike powertrain in a rear hub, or an 8-speed Shimano geared hub without a motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside.jpg\" alt=\"Diodra S3 lightweight simple bamboo ebike, made-in-EU\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_EU-made_non-driveside-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>Diodra S3 commuter ebike</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diodra S3 ebike build is the standout model, at a claimed 15.45kg for a size M. A custom Taiwanese-made 500W brushless motor and 300Wh of batteries powers the 46x16T single-speed – all inside the rear hub. Stepped down to 250W and speed limited to 25kph to comply with EU rules. There are 3 pedal-assist modes, with the eco mode said to deliver an 80km range. Diodra tucks all electronics – from the torque sensor to wireless Bluetooth communication to the charging port – into the hub making for an incredibly sleek setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control.jpg\" alt=\"Diodra S3 lightweight simple bamboo ebike, made-in-EU, mobile app control\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_mobile-app-control-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And a custom-developed smartphone app controls it all – for Android or iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania.jpg\" alt=\"Diodra S3 &amp; M8 lightweight simple bamboo ebike/bike frame, made-in-Romania\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike-frame-made-in-Romania-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame itself is made of a lightweight hollowed-out laminated bamboo structure. Then, bonded to a 7075 aluminum headtube and aluminum seattube with an attached bottom bracket. Out back, machined slider dropouts dial-in chain tension, mount the rear brake, and allow for chain or belt compatibility. Diodra claims this construction delivers all the durability a city bike needs, plus “exceptional vibration absorption” from the natural characteristics of the bamboo. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"Diodra S3 &amp; M8 lightweight simple bamboo ebike/bike geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diodra-S3-lightweight-simple-bamboo-ebike_geometry-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bamboo frame comes in three stock sizes (S-L), rated for riders up to 100kg.
