In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, you can only view the current day and the next 10 days, but in ‌iOS 17‌, you can view current day, the next 10 days, and the weather from the previous day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-yesterday-weather.jpg\" alt width=\"3060\" height=\"3000\" />\r<br />\n10-day forecasts show the chance of rain each day and offer a \"daily summary\" instead of a forecast.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe main Weather interface has been updated with large \"My Location\" text for the weather forecast in at your current location, with the city underneath. In ‌iOS 16‌, it simply said the city, which could be confusing when navigating through multiple saved cities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome of the weather modules have been relocated, with rain and hourly forecasts shown first. News and alerts are shown lower in the app, and there is a new \"Averages\" weather module that displays how the current temperature deviates from the historical average on that day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-weather-averages.jpg\" alt width=\"3060\" height=\"3000\" />\r<br />\nApple has added a moon module that shows the current status of the moon, the time until the next full moon, moonset and moonrise times, and a moon calendar, plus the wind speed module is a larger size that shows information on gust speed at a glance. The wind module also displays a daily comparison and a wind scale.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-moon-position.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1961\" />\r<br />\nDaily comparisons are included for UV index, humidity, the \"Feels Like\" index, and visibility, and there are options to change units for wind speed, precipitation, pressure, and distance. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple does not appear to have made any changes to the data that is used for the Weather app, despite complaints of its inaccuracy following the incorporation of the Dark Sky app.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-weather-app/\">Here's What's New in the iOS 17 Weather App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-whats-new-in-the-ios-17-weather-app.2392134/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"45352c22ba8dc7047592ce3e1669befbf7fc8a805f367fe1275df32f6d7f4b74","category":"Apple"}
