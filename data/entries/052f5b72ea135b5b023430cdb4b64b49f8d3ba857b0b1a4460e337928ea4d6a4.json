Instead, OpenAI hopes greater exposure on iPhones will\nhelp it sell a paid version of ChatGPT, which costs around $20 a\nmonth for individuals. Apple would take its 30% cut of these\nsubscriptions as is customary for in-app purchases.</p>\n\n<p>Sometime in the future, Apple hopes to strike revenue-sharing\nagreements with AI partners in which it gets a cut of the revenue\ngenerated from integrating their chatbots with the iPhone,\naccording to Bloomberg, which first reported details of the deal.\nOpenAI leaders have privately said the Apple arrangement could be\nworth billions of dollars to the startup if things go well, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-cements-control-as-he-secures-apple-deal?rc=c48ukx\">The\nInformation previously reported</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I enjoy how Ma threw in a link to his own report from two weeks ago, but didn’t link to <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/13/gurman-openai-apple\">Gurman’s scoop</a> — posted a full day earlier — <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash\">at Bloomberg</a>.
