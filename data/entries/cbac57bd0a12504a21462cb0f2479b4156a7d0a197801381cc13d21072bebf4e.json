By \ntraining models on a diverse dataset spanning visual and \nlinguistic information, the MM1 models were able to excel at tasks \nlike image captioning, visual question answering, and natural \nlanguage inference. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mckbrando/status/1768658016600305903\">Summary thread on Twitter/X from team member Brandon McKinzie</a>, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39722498\">Hacker News thread</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/240316/p18#a240316p18\">roundup of commentary from Techmeme</a>.
