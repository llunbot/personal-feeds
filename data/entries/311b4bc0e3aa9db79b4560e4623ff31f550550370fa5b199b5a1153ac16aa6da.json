But one thing that most sources have agreed on is the basic idea that it will once again appear in a single size, based on the chassis of a standard iPhone model from the past two to three years: most likely the iPhone 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That now appears to be out of the window. Images of 3D-printed dummy models have been posted by the Apple blog <a href=\"https://www.macotakara.jp/rumor/entry-47785.html\" target=\"_blank\">Macotakara</a>, and these clearly show two sizes: one based on the iPhone 14, and another larger model based on the iPhone 14 Plus. This is a new concept and, if accurate, would come as a major shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE has historically been Apple’s cheapest smartphone, but it has also been one of the smaller entries in the range: with the mini no longer an option, this is the handset customers go for if they find modern smartphone design too bulky for their tastes (or pockets). The 3rd-gen SE is smaller than the iPhone 14 in every dimension and weighs about 16 percent less, so the expected 2025 redesign was already going to involve a certain amount of upscaling. So creating an SE Plus would be a major rethink of what the SE is supposed to offer.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone SE\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1959w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/22_93d972.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple has never offered two variations of the iPhone SE.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But the move makes sense if you think about the importance of Apple Intelligence. Apple still sells the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 but neither supports its AI platform. Every sale of one of those handsets is another customer who won’t be contributing training data and helping the company to catch up with ChatGPT and will be missing out on the marquee iPhone feature of 2025. So the ideal would be to replace them as soon as possible with something of similar price and spec, only with the ability to run Apple Intelligence. The next SE fits the bill perfectly, but only if it comes in two sizes so there’s something to replace the 14/15 Plus as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next spring, then, Apple unveils the 4th-gen SE in two sizes, based on the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. This, coupled with the in-house 5G modem and A18 processor, and support for Apple Intelligence, is enough to generate plenty of media coverage and customer interest, without pushing up the price too much. But it also maneuvers Apple into a position where it can safely remove the entire 14- and 15-series iPhone families from its store, and from then on sell only phones that support its AI system. Neat, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe. I only said it makes more sense than you’d think, not that the plan is foolproof. Clearing out all the unsold iPhone 14s and 15s still represents a major logistical headache, and the SE brand has been somewhat tainted since the unpopular 3rd-gen launch. It remains to be seen whether customers will be prepared to pay as much for an SE as they would for an 18-month-old “full fat” iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that matter, there are doubts over the leak itself. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/sketchy-rumor-iphone-se-4-plus/\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors</a>, for one, describes the rumor as “highly dubious given previous reports and Apple’s typical strategy for its budget iPhone line.” Which is true, as I discuss above. And dummy models should never be taken as firm evidence of anything. Anyone can knock up a dummy model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, I wouldn’t dismiss the idea out of hand. It would be a radical move, but that’s what the SE line needs.
