You'll notice a slight change aesthetically since the previous generation that gives the seatpost a little more breathing room for soaking up vibrations.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/lapierre_xelius_sl_8.0_frr_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>There's a new stem with a -5.7° angle that helps aerodynamically by housing the newly integrated cables and hoses – for mechanical groupsets it's semi-integrated.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/lapierre_xelius_sl_8.0_frr_4.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Although the Xelius SL is seen as a climber's bike and used as such by Groupama-FDJ and FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope, it's also the go-to for rougher surfaces and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/cycling-spring-classics\" target=\"_blank\">cobbled classics</a> with a bit more flex and several vibration damping features. That's why there's now clearance for 32mm tyres, though we rode on 25s.</p>\n<h2>Lapierre Xelius SL 8.0 first ride review</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/lapierre_xelius_sl3_vence1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>From the first few pedal strokes, the signs are encouraging. Its new lighter weight, more compact geometry and stiff lay-up – riding a size L meant the construction of this frame is slightly stiffer than the smaller versions – brings a good balance of stability and agility on flatter sections.</p>\n<p>Of course, given its design and purpose it comes as no surprise that the Xelius is comfortable. The very few imperfect roads on offer provoked but a slight rumble through the frame.</p>\n<p>Once the roads hit the mountains it cameinto its own, whether putting the power down or easing my way up, though it really shone when out of the saddle.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/lapierre_xelius_sl3_vence7.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It's clearly not the stiffest bike around and deliberately so, when standing on the pedals it blends comfort and stiffness at exactly the level I'd want it, not putting up a fight but keeping all momentum in the right direction.</p>\n<p>It descends confidently too with the new aerodynamic improvements – and the big bloke on the saddle – helping to gather speed nicely without too much push.</p>\n<p>Even in the wet, sweeping bends were super easy and that's something that doesn't come naturally to me after previous incidents hitting the deck, so for most riders it's probably about as free flowing as you'd like.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/lapierre_xelius_sl3_vence12.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10325/lapierre-xelius-sl-2022\">2022 Lapierre Xelius SL3: Versatile race bike range gets new lay-ups and across the board refinements</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9815/david-gaudu-and-groupama-fdjs-new-lapierre-xelius-sl\">David Gaudu and Groupama-FDJ's new Lapierre Xelius SL</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4343/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: the best bikes on the market from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nWhile we wait to see what the full verdict on the new Lapierre Xelius SL range is in the new year when we get one for a full test in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cyclist </em>magazine</a>, it's clear the time and effort put into this generation has paid off.</p>\n<p>Between conversations with Lapierre's professional partners and feedback from both previous Xelius models and the aero-focussed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/9015/lapierre-aircode-drs-80-review\" target=\"_blank\">Aircode</a> bikes, it's been refined into a super versatile racer.</p>\n<p>To be the machine for both <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/paris-roubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/1448/mont-ventoux-the-giant-of-provence\" target=\"_blank\">Mont Ventoux</a> is pretty special, if even if FDJ riders didn't necessarily excel in those races. For us regular cyclists having one that can do both well is a blessing. Where are your genres now, cycling industry?</p>\n<p>When Thibaut Pinot flies to victory up Alpe d'Huez on Bastille Day next year – albeit on a higher specced model – we'll see how good it really is.</p>\n<p><em>Image credits: Lapierre</em> </p>\n  </div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f406e731ff8f54189d8845f50d0f3072bb8af37aefa81c05ccfad470c7a9cfa2","category":"Cycling"}
