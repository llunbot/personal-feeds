During part of that stay, Bowser tells The Guardian, he was paid $1 an hour for four-hour shifts counseling other prisoners on suicide watch.</p>\n<p>From that money, Bowser says he “was paying Nintendo $25 a month” while behind bars. That lines up roughly with a discussion Bowser had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKJiGTJtWrA\">with the Nick Moses podcast</a> last year, where he said he had already paid $175 to Nintendo during his detention.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000726#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"01c9aaf35de3606a92f31b14dac5d7a5b2886b5fe1a30f00050b92c93bcb4eb7","category":"Tech"}
