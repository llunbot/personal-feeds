If you're secretly shopping for a holiday gift or planning a surprise party, you might want to temporarily obscure your actual location in Apple's Find My app on your iPhone without completely turning off location sharing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/FindMy-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nHere's a clever trick that lets you keep sharing enabled while displaying a different location – all by using another Apple device you own.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo hide your actual location, you'll need to own an iPhone and an iPad, or two iPhones or two iPads (i.e. not a Mac) signed in to your Apple Account with Find My enabled. This method works by telling Find My to use a stationary device's location instead of your iPhone's.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStart by leaving the device you want to use as your displayed location (like an iPad) in a convincing spot – perhaps your home or office. Then, take your iPhone and follow these steps:\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n    <li>Open the Find My app and tap the <strong>Me</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen.</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Scroll down to find \"Use This iPhone as My Location\" and make sure it's toggled off.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/turn-off-find-my-share-location.jpeg\" alt=\"find my\" width=\"5472\" height=\"3078\" />\r<br />\n    </li><li>Grab your other Apple device and open Find My.</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Tap the <strong>Me</strong> tab, then select \"Use this [device] as My Location.\" \r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/use-ipad-find-my-location.jpg\" alt=\"find my\" width=\"1488\" height=\"1022\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Toggle on the switch next to <strong>Share My Location</strong>. Your shared location will now show where this device is stationed, not where you actually are with your iPhone.</li>\r<br />\n    <li>When you're ready to resume normal location sharing, simply return to your iPhone's Find My app and toggle \"Use This iPhone as My Location\" back on.</li>\r<br />\n</ol>Remember that this trick only works as long as your decoy device stays put and powered on. Lastly, we trust that you'll use this tip responsibly – like keeping that upcoming surprise party under wraps!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/hide-your-iphone-find-my-location/\">Hide iPhone Find My Location Without Raising Suspicion</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hide-iphone-find-my-location-without-raising-suspicion.2443050/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"723379ef3f20abad7648af370dc55837b20950c69bd2259b555c5a83966dc9a2","category":"Apple"}
