That’s why it’s important to get yourself one of the best cycling neck warmers; they’ll help you keep the wind chill at bay and breathe easier in frosty conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re tackling a crisp morning commute, braving the winter training miles, or heading out on a long ride in unpredictable weather, the right neck warmer can make all the difference to your comfort. They come in all guises, usually made from lightweight and stretchy fabrics that wick moisture and dry quickly, while some will have an extra fleecy or thermal layer to stave off the cold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, a good neck warmer will offer warmth without bulk, and thanks to their versatile, tubular design, they can be worn in different ways to suit your needs. Pull it up over your mouth and nose, wear it as a headband to just protect your ears from the wind, or double it up for extra insulation. And if it’s not overly insulated they’re ideal for keeping out pollution, dust and dirt from your mouth and nose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">best winter cycling gloves</a>, neck warmers come in a range of thicknesses and materials to suit different conditions. From ultralight and breathable merino wool, to windproof warmers for the harshest winter rides, there’s something for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are our top picks for the best neck warmers for cycling, carefully chosen by the <em>Cyclist</em> team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best cycling neck warmers at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Buff Original EcoStretch: RRP £16.95</strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>GripGrab Freedom Warp Knitted Seamless Neck Warmer: RRP £40</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Velocio Signature Collar: RRP £31</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapha Winter Collar: RRP £38</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MAAP Evade X Lightweight Neck Warmer: RRP £36</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buff ThermoNet Neckgaiter: RRP £21.95 </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>GripGrab Multifunctional Merino Neck Warmer: RRP £30</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Castelli Pro Thermal Neck Warmer: RRP £27</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sportful SRK Neck Warmer: RRP £25</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Altura Merino Blend Neck Warmer: RRP £15</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why you can trust <em>Cyclist</em>‘s advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/03073812/all-city_zig_zag_review_3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"all-city_zig_zag_review_3\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While a good cycling neck warmer seems like a small detail, when the mercury drops, it can make a huge difference to your ride.

The four-way stretch fabric means it moves with you rather than feeling restrictive, and it won’t slide down mid-ride.

While it still has a seamless vertical design, it features different weave patterns to provide a balance of insulation, stretch and breathability. A waffle-like texture at the sides and back adds warmth, while the finer mesh at the front provides adequate airflow and quick drying.

It’s made from remnants of material used for other Velocio garments, which means you get a mid-weight dual-knit Italian performance fabric that balances insulation and breathability. It keeps the chill off without overheating, making it ideal for cool-weather riding rather than extreme winter conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collar does a good job of wicking away moisture and dries quickly, helping you to regulate temperature on longer rides. It also has a small reflective logo at the back for a touch of added visibility, though it’s fairly subtle.

This helps it contour better around the back of the neck and head, so it sits snug and prevents bunching. The fabric itself is a high-airflow mesh that makes quick work of wicking away sweat and drying.

With minimal branding and no reflective details, it won’t make you any more visible on dark rides, but if you’re looking for a simple, naturally insulating cycling neck warmer, it’s a reliable option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> A high-quality and versatile merino neck warmer with a looser fit that would better suit folks with larger heads.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Castelli Pro Thermal Neck Warmer</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-970x536.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-970x536.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-300x166.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-768x424.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-1536x848.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-2048x1131.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-750x414.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Castelli-flat-2-1140x630.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP £27.00 | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CF5Q7SZ9\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thermoflex fabric is warm, stretchy, and luxuriously soft</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fleecy lining adds warmth without unnecessary bulk</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Raw-cut edges for a seamless feel and no irritation</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Castelli Pro Thermal Neck Warmer comes with a premium feel and sleek, minimalist design that you’d expect from the brand. Geared towards chilly winter rides, it’s made from Castelli’s Thermoflex fabric, found in all its warmers. It’s beautifully soft and stretchy, and comes with a brushed fleece lining that provides a decent amount of insulation without adding much bulk.

The bold red colour we tried is particularly eye-catching, and while it’s got a really large Castelli logo printed across the fabric, it’s in a slightly lighter shade of the same colour, so it’s actually very subtle.

Unlike some stretchier options on the market, this one has slightly less give, which is great for locking in warmth, but might be too tight if you have a larger head, or if you want to be able to remove it easily while on the go. In terms of construction, it’s quite similar to the Castelli Pro Thermal, with a simple, tubular shape, single vertical flat locked seam at the back, and raw-cut hems. This means no bulky stitches to irritate your eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Sportful-1140x641.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What really sets the SRK Neck Warmer apart is its wind-blocking capabilities. It may not be a heavy-duty winter warmer, but it does pack an impressive punch when it comes to shielding against chilly breezes, so it’s a great choice for autumn and spring riding. It’s also breathable enough to work well when the temperature’s milder, without causing you to overheat. It’s pretty versatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly to the Castelli, it comes in several bright colour options, including a hi-vis yellow colour if you’re concerned with being easily seen by other road users. The red version we have has a really nice and subtle orange fade. They’ve kept the branding fairly minimal, with a small square of black ‘Sportful’ text and a tiny reflective ‘S’ logo on the side. It’s one of the few neck warmers on this list to have a subtle reflective element, though it’s not large enough to make a huge difference in low light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: A snug-fitting, high quality neck warmer with great wind protection, though the tighter fit won’t suit everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Altura Merino Blend Neck Warmer</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-970x679.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-970x679.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-300x210.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-768x537.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-1536x1074.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-2048x1433.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-750x525.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Altura-flat-2-1140x797.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP £15.00 | <a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/305852557929?_skw=altura+merino+blend+neck+warmer&amp;hash=item47363baa69:g:SJMAAOSwsoNnFmaL&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5338149442&amp;toolid=10001&amp;customid=m7w5npd8fc03nh9m00003\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Merino blend fabric is warm, breathable, and odour resistant</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The most reflective option on this list, so ideal for night-time visibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While it lacks raw-cut edges, it’s excellent value for money</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re concerned about being visible in low-light conditions, then the Altura Merino Blend Neck Warmer is the most reflective choice of the bunch.

Altura goes a step further than the rest, with a large strip of reflective diagonal lines running the full length of one side, next to a bold, vertical logo that’s also reflective.

It’s a pretty solid choice for year-round use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fit is a little on the snug side, which can help keep the warmth in, but again isn’t going to be ideal for some people with larger heads, or who just prefer a looser, more relaxed fit.

Here are some key things to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Material and warmth</strong>: Neck warmers come in a range of materials, and all of them offer different levels of insulation and breathability. Some are designed to keep you warm in freezing temperatures, while others are geared to more mild conditions. Merino wool is a naturally warm, breathable and moisture-wicking fabric that’s great for cold rides and won’t cause overheating. Synthetic fabrics like polyester and fleece are typically lightweight, quick drying, and more affordable. There are also hybrid options that combine merino and synthetic fibres for a balance of warmth, stretch and durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breathability and moisture management</strong>: If you ride hard, you breathe hard, and you’ll sweat even when it’s winter. All that moisture has to go somewhere, and the last thing you want is a neck warmer that traps it against your skin. Look for options with good moisture-wicking properties that will help you to stay dry and comfortable. Thinner fabrics can be less likely to hold onto moisture and prevent the buildup of condensation when you’re breathing through them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fit and versatility</strong>: Most neck warmers are one-size-fits-all, thanks to their stretchy and tubular design, so generally you shouldn’t have to worry about fit. That said, some are designed to sit closer to the face than others. A snug fit can offer maximum warmth, while a loose one can make it easier to adjust around your other clothing. Some will have additional darts or stitches to shape them around the contours of your face, while others are a straight and simple tube. The latter are the most versatile, and can be worn in different ways. In addition to covering your mouth and nose, you could wear them as a headband or a beanie, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Packability and weight</strong>: Most cycling neck warmers are lightweight and easy to stash away in a jersey pocket when you don’t need them. If every gram counts, then thinner fabrics will be more easily folded or scrunched away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Colours and reflective details</strong>: As with any piece of kit, it’s also important that you like the look of it and want to wear it. Many neck warmers will come with an array of colour and patterns to choose from, so shop around to see what speaks to you. A good thing to look out for, especially if you’re riding through winter and likely to get caught out after dark, is reflective detailing. Some neck warmers will have reflective logos or trim, which can help to keep you a little more visible to other road users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is the difference between a neck warmer and a buff?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like you might say you’re writing with a biro, cleaning with a hoover or wearing lycra, a ‘buff’ is actually a brand name that’s become synonymous with tubular neck warmers. You’ll often find the two terms used interchangeably, though we’ve avoided doing that here to prevent confusion. Naturally, Buff is on our list above, but lots of other brands make high-quality neck warmers too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should I get a merino or synthetic neck warmer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer to this depends largely on your personal preference and the riding conditions you’re heading out in. Merino wool is warm, breathable, and naturally odour-resistant. That makes it great for all-day rides and multi-day adventures, because you can wear it for a long time without it starting to smell. Synthetic options, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable and will dry faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-neck-warmers\">Best neck warmers 2025 for cycling: Buffs etc for heat or dust protection</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"82144e633a17ace3ebc97fa0061be0f9c5385efadb609c938f32dc10a95cf820","category":"Cycling"}
