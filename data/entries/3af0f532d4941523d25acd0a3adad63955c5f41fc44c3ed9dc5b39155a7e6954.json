The placeholder page says the device is \"coming soon,\" but it offers no further information, and the price shown is obviously not real.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe listing was spotted by a reader of the <a href=\"https://www.numerama.com/tech/1902583-boulanger-annonce-le-nouvel-iphone-se-avant-apple-par-erreur.html\">French technology news website <em>Numerama</em></a>. It is unclear if Boulanger has received a heads up from Apple that a new iPhone SE is coming, or if the placeholder page was created in light of rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the page does not reveal anything specific, it is yet another sign that a new iPhone SE is seemingly coming soon. Unfortunately, it seems like the rumored timeframe has shifted slightly. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/gurman-new-iphone-se-this-week/\">new iPhone SE was \"coming this week,\"</a> but he has since said it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/\">\"should be announced by next week.\"</a>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-SE-Boulanger.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1216\" height=\"732\" />\r<br />\nWhenever the new iPhone SE is finally announced, it is rumored to feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, and the first Apple-designed 5G modem. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/iphone-se-4-a18-chip-identifier-leak/\">With a rumored A18 chip</a>, along with a rumored 8GB of RAM, the device is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/\">expected to support Apple Intelligence</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to schedule an event in 2025, so the new iPhone SE will likely be announced in a press release published on the Apple Newsroom website.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/new-iphone-se-product-listing/\">'New' iPhone SE Product Listing Appears on French Website</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-se-product-listing-appears-on-french-website.2449242/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3af0f532d4941523d25acd0a3adad63955c5f41fc44c3ed9dc5b39155a7e6954","category":"Apple"}
