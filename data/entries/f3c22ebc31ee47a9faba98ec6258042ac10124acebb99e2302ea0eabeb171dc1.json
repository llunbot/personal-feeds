The partnership aims to bring Kairos Power's initial SMR online by 2030, with additional reactor deployments planned through 2035, though no working SMR has yet been constructed in the US. With the energy demands of AI growing, Google has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/re-opened-three-mile-island-will-power-ai-data-centers-under-new-deal/\">not been alone</a> in encouraging new development of alternative, no-emission power sources.</p>\n<p>\"The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies,\" Google Senior Director of Energy and Climate Michael Terrell said in a press statement. \"This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.\"</p>\n<p>If the Google-Kairos plan succeeds in creating working reactors, it will reportedly enable up to 500 MW of carbon-free power to be added to US electricity grids. For Google, it's a key step toward making its headlong rush into power-hungry (and sometimes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/\">dubious</a>) AI applications seem environmentally clean and ethical at a time when the world has seen devastating <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/\">meteorological effects</a> from climate change.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-and-kairos-sign-nuclear-reactor-deal-with-aim-to-power-ai/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-and-kairos-sign-nuclear-reactor-deal-with-aim-to-power-ai/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f3c22ebc31ee47a9faba98ec6258042ac10124acebb99e2302ea0eabeb171dc1","category":"Tech"}
