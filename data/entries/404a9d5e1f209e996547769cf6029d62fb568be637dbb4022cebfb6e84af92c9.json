Frustratingly, the ads seem to be rather difficult to disable, and some are also outdated ads and/or confusing content.</p>\n<p>The ads, visible on users' home screens when they hover over a game title, can only be removed if you disconnect from the Internet, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-homescreen-now-replaces-unique-video-game-art-with-annoying-ads-you-cant-turn-off\">IGN</a> reported today. However, that would block a lot of the console’s functionality. The PS5 dashboard previously had ads but not on the home screen.</p>\n<p>Before this recent development, people would see game art if they hovered over a game icon on the PS5’s home screen. Now, doing so reportedly brings up dated advertisements. For example, IGN reported seeing <a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/img-5026-1727699908609.JPG\">an ad for <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em></a> “coming soon exclusively in cinemas” when hovering over the <em>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> game. Webheads will of course recall that the Spider-Verse movie came out in June 2023.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053372#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053372&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"404a9d5e1f209e996547769cf6029d62fb568be637dbb4022cebfb6e84af92c9","category":"Tech"}
