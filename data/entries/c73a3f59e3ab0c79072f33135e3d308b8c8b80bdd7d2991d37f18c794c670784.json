and Two) especially receiving attention.</p>\n<p>Rather than continuing with the race to squeeze as many sprockets onto a cassette as it can, Box has reimagined the 9-speed drivetrain for 2023.</p>\n<p>This is said to be a bonus for eMTB riders, and those who want reliable shifting in all conditions, with less day to day fine-tuning of their drivetrains.</p>\n<p>The one-piece cassettes have completely new tooth profiles to boost longevity and performance.</p>\n<p>This means the tooth profiles have been designed to fit perfectly with their own chain, while the leading edge of the teeth is wider, to improve wear. Shifting ramps have also been worked on to make the chain’s transition from one to another smoother.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/box-components-shifter-top-5dc89d8.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"box components shifter top\" title=\"box components shifter top\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The square shifter looks as though it shouldn’t interfere with brake levers too much.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/box-components-shifter-lever-adjustment-b1b6d96.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"box components shifter lever adjustment\" title=\"box components shifter lever adjustment\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>9-speed is back!</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/box-components-shifter-levers-667bda7.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"box components shifter levers\" title=\"box components shifter levers\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Magnesium is used to help keep weight in check.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/box-components-cassette-32330ee.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"box components cassette\" title=\"box components cassette\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The one-piece cassette has 9 sprockets, Box claims this aids reliability.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>At the same time, the hardening process has been improved, with Box claiming double the longevity.</p>\n<p>The derailleurs have a horizontal actuation, which Box says gives lighter <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/how-to-change-gears-on-a-bike/\">gear shifting</a> and fewer ghost shifts. It has also given the clutch a wider range of adjustment and increased torque, while the derailleur gets titanium hardware in the top-level One groupset.</p>\n<p>Finally, the shifter’s body and levers are magnesium, while the internal gears are metal. Add in a no-loss engagement, and Box claims crisp shifts and improved life.

Magura claims you’ll get up to a year’s use out of it, though. This, of course, depends on how often you ride, and how much you drop.</p>\n<p>The system has minimal lag between button press and dropper actuation, and unlike the previous version, the post’s valving remains open for as long as the button is pressed.</p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c73a3f59e3ab0c79072f33135e3d308b8c8b80bdd7d2991d37f18c794c670784","category":"Cycling"}
