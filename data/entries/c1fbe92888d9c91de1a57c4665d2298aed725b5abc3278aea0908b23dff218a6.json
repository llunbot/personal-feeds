If you pause a show that's playing, you can see details on the actors, the song that's playing, and more. If you're using an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as a remote for an ‌Apple TV‌, you can get InSight information right on your phone. Note that this feature only works with ‌Apple TV‌+ content right now.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Enhance Dialogue and Subtitles</strong> - Enhance Dialogue is setting that already exists, but Apple is making it better with machine learning and computational audio improvements. It'll be better at improving vocal clarity over loud music, action scenes, and background noise. Plus Apple updated it so it works with HDMI-connected speakers, when playing content on ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, when using AirPods, and with other Bluetooth audio devices. As a bonus, Apple is also improving subtitles, so they'll appear intelligently such as when content is muted or when a TV show or movie is rewound.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>FaceTime Updates</strong> - When you use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> with your ‌Apple TV‌ with an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ as the camera, you can now see real-time Live Captions during the call. This works in English in the United States and Canada. Semi-related, there is a new option to use SharePlay so everyone can contribute songs to a party playlist by scanning a QR code.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>New Screen Savers</strong> - Apple is adding new screen saver options, including Portraits (shows your Portrait images), TV and Movies, and Snoopy.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Projector Support</strong> - If you have a projector, you'll be pleased to hear that tvOS 18 adds support for the 21:9 aspect ratio used by most projectors.</li>\r<br />\n</ol>\r<br />\nWhat do you think of the new features coming in tvOS 18?
