Based on online reports, the main Continuity feature to be negatively impacted by the updates appears to be Universal Control. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo recap the feature‌‌, if you have a Mac and an ‌‌iPad‌‌ next to each other and signed into the same Apple ID, you can use the keyboard and cursor on one device across both of them. So a Mac's trackpad can be used over on the ‌‌‌iPad‌‌‌ just by swiping across, and the Mac's keyboard will become the ‌‌iPad‌‌'s input device. The reverse is also true of an ‌‌‌iPad‌‌‌ if you have a keyboard and mouse attached to it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBarring a restore of the previous OS, suggested solutions that have worked for some users include: Signing out of one's iCloud account on both devices; disabling, restarting, then re-enabling Handoff/Auto Unlock with Apple Watch; turning Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth on and off again; and toggling checkboxes related to Universal Control features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not commented on the Continuity bugs, but it is likely aware of them and working on solutions. The company is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/ios-16-4-1-expected-soon/\">rumored</a> to be preparing to release iOS 16.4.1 for the iPhone, so it could release iPadOS 16.4.1 and macOS 13.3.1 in tandem. Such minor updates are typically focused on bug fixes and security improvements.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/universal-control/\">Universal Control</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/continuity-bugs-macos-13-3-ios-16-4/\">macOS 13.3 and iPadOS 16.4 Users Report Issues With Continuity Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-13-3-and-ipados-16-4-users-report-issues-with-continuity-features.2385955/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d63b1ba9195cd234e8ae3e37bf5aa8d56e2c1213d6b2849b4ef57b7cf6f40a7","category":"Apple"}
