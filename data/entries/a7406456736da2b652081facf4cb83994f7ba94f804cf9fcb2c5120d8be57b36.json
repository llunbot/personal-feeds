The feature will prevent adult <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users from being subjected to unwanted imagery. All nudity will be blocked, but can be viewed by tapping the \"Show\" button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSensitive Content Warnings work like the Communication Safety functionality that Apple added for children, with all detection done on device so Apple does not see the content that's being shared. Sensitive Content Warnings are an expansion of the Communication Safety options that Apple introduced for children last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCommunication Safety detects and blocks nude images before children can view them, and with ‌iOS 17‌, this too will expand to encompass AirDrop, the systemwide photo picker, ‌FaceTime‌ messages, and third-party apps.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/ios-17-block-nude-photos/\">iOS 17 Can Automatically Block Unsolicited Nude Photos With 'Sensitive Content Warnings'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-can-automatically-block-unsolicited-nude-photos-with-sensitive-content-warnings.2392143/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a7406456736da2b652081facf4cb83994f7ba94f804cf9fcb2c5120d8be57b36","category":"Apple"}
