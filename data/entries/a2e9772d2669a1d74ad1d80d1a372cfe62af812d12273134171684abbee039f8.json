Shackley chats about her role within the super team, what it’s like riding among some of the biggest names in the sport and, ultimately, where she sees herself progressing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She is also candid about the jump from junior level to the WorldTour, the lack of women’s U23 races as well as the issues in the UK racing scene and what needs to be done to nurture youngsters coming up the ranks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview starts at 5:45.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/anna-shackley\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 90 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know Cyclist is also stunning monthly magazine?

When stored carbs are depleted, your body starts to convert fat into ketones. Studies show that ketones are 28% more efficient than glucose, making them a super-efficient fuel source for the brain and the body.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These benefits led H.V.M.N to create Ketone-IQ: a drinkable ketone designed to support energy, focus and endurance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Developed alongside the U.S. military, Ketone-IQ is one of the most powerful ketone supplements on the market. It’s designed to elevate your ketone levels for up to 4 hours – much longer than other products. Plus, it’s vegan, caffeine free, and compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s guidelines. That’s a major win for athletes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ketone-IQ Shots are the best way to get your ketones on the go. They’re portable, convenient, and fit perfectly in your pocket during a ride or a race.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can save 30% on Ketone-IQ using the promo code CYCLIST at  <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST\" target=\"_blank\">https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about achieving your ultimate metabolic potential, subscribe to H.V.M.N’s podcast ‘Health Via Modern Nutrition with Dr. Latt Mansor’ on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube.
