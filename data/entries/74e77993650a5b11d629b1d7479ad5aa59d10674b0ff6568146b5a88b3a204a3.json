[credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\">Microsoft</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>It's not as big an upgrade as the Surface Pro 8, but Microsoft's Surface Go tablet got an update today. The Surface Go 3 retains the same 10.5-inch 1920×1280 screen, the same ports, and the same physical design as the Surface Go 2, but it upgrades the processors, adds 802.11ax Wi-Fi support, and ships with Windows 11 Home by default. The Surface Go 3 starts at the same $400 as the previous model and is <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=ArsSurface2021&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-go-3%2F904h27d0cbwn%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\">available for preorder today</a>; the cellular model will be available in \"the coming months.\"</p>\n<p>The Surface Go's biggest problem has always been that, especially in its cheapest configurations, its processor, RAM, and storage specs have all been dangerously close to the bare minimum it takes to run Windows comfortably. And the Surface Go 3 doesn't do much to address that. The dual-core Pentium Gold 6500Y and quad-core Core i3-10100Y processors <em>are</em> a significant and welcome step up from the Pentium and Core m3 chips in the Surface Go 2, but the entry-level Go 3 still includes just 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. That's a bit more than <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-system-requirements-6d4e9a79-66bf-7950-467c-795cf0386715\">Microsoft's minimum system requirements for Windows 10</a>, but they just barely meet the increased minimum RAM and storage requirements for Windows 11.</p>\n<p>The version of the Go 3 that is available to consumers tops out at 128GB of storage, so you'll need to rely on microSD storage or cloud storage if you need more than that. There is a 256GB version of the Go 3, but it's only available to businesses. And unlike the Surface Pro 8 or Pro X, the SSD on the Surface Go 3 still isn't user-replaceable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797143#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797143&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"74e77993650a5b11d629b1d7479ad5aa59d10674b0ff6568146b5a88b3a204a3","category":"Tech"}
