At only 4″ wide the load stays tight to the bike on singletrack and will not get in your way on those nasty hike-a-bikes. An external compression system keeps the bag snug at various load levels.</p>\n<p>The devil is in the details on our rack attachment system. Although simple in concept, the tight spacing between the aluminum loop and strap prevents slop at the pannier rails. A bomber Voile nano strap with metal hardware provides tension at the bottom and gives versatility in mounting.</p>\n<p>Fiberglass stiffened high density foam frame sheet gives the bag internal structure and works with the external compression system to transfer load to the rack. Made with 200 denier UHMWPE / Polyester woven laminated fabric, the Nanos have a minimum of seams for durability and water resistance, plus double taped lower seams.</p>\n<p>Think of these bags as frame bag supplements that stay on your bike; designed to carry dense and heavy stuff like food, water, and fuel with a low profile form. With a bikepacking mindset you still put your bulky, high water sensitive items like clothing, sleeping and shelter gear in a waterproof handle bar setup, seat pack, or on top of the rack deck.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> These panniers are not compatieble with “T” style racks. They lack the load capacity and means for a lower attachment.</p>\n<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Pair: 18 oz / 510 gm</p>\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 7-11 L Each side; 420-680 cubic inches each side</p>\n<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Challenge Sailcloth 200 denier UHMWPE / Polyester woven with PET film lamination</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/cargo/NanoPanniers\" target=\"_blank\">Revelate</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Doppo-1_CK_Open_House_2048x.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.sim.works/products/doppo-atb-frame-set?variant=12097682243685\" target=\"_blank\">Sim Works Doppo Frame and Fork Back in Stock</a> $2,099</h3>\n<p>Presented by Simworks, this all-terrain bike frame- an update of the original and badge defining model within the Doppo line, was created based on a blueprint with the concept of “walking alone.” Let your rides unfold as chapters in your novel life adventure.

The Spaniard – who works as a nurse when not competing on the bike – still has a long way to travel in her cycling career, we think. And this girl just keeps going, her marvellous engine is matched with a never-say-die spirit. Last year she won the prestigious La Traka in the 200km category. This year she went for the longer course of 360km, a distance she’s never ridden in one hit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vij6FMlLVh0\" target=\"_blank\">Bikepacking Scotland – The Book</a></h3>\n<p>You can find out more at <span><a href=\"https://bikepackingscotland.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\">https://bikepackingscotland.com/books/</a></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAZK0mfTrBk\" target=\"_blank\">I Quit My Car for 30 Days, Here’s What Happened</a></h3>\n<p>Mitch Boyer’s parents had a 1990s Specialized Hardrock lying around so he turned it into the perfect errand bike for Los Angeles.
