The problem is, they can get heavy very quickly, and tend to move around a lot while riding in rough terrain. If you’re carrying all your gear on your bike and only need to carry your water on your back, that solves some problems but a backpack will still sit much further off your back. Hydration vests solve this problem but many have a reduced water bladder capacity. PeDALED’s answer is the Odyssey Hydro Vest, which combines a 1.5L bladder with a cooler bag to keep your water and your core temperature cool. </p>\n<p>Features:<br />\n-Adjustable shoulder straps/fit<br />\n-Front closure with 2 buckles, adjustable in both height and width<br />\n-Reflective bands and logo on the back<br />\n-Large mesh pocket on the back, 2 in the front to carry soft flasks or food<br />\n-3 zippered pockets<br />\n-Insulated cooler bag<br />\n-1.5-liter hydration bladder with hose</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://pedaled.com/eu_en/mens-cycling-hydro-vest-odyssey-black\" target=\"_blank\">PeDALED</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"564730fc4cb38478c65e8e761d10ecf37b9a64a4c7d38fd4eb694732a3dd029c","category":"Cycling"}
