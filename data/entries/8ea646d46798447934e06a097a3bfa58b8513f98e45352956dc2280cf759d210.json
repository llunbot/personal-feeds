{"title":"Google Fires 28 Employees Who Disrupted Workplaces to Protest Israel Cloud Contract","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract","date":1713489315000,"content":"\n<p>Chris Rackow, Google’s head of global security, in a company-wide memo published at The Verge, under the clear subject “Serious consequences for disruptive behavior”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Behavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not \ntolerate it. It clearly violates multiple policies that all \nemployees must adhere to — including our Code of Conduct and \nPolicy on Harassment, Discrimination, Retaliation, Standards of \nConduct, and Workplace Concerns. </p>\n\n<p>We are a place of business and every Googler is expected to read \nour policies and apply them to how they conduct themselves and \ncommunicate in our workplace. The overwhelming majority of our \nemployees do the right thing. If you’re one of the few who are \ntempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our \npolicies, think again. The company takes this extremely seriously, \nand we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take \naction against disruptive behavior — up to and including \ntermination. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It says a lot about how adrift Google was that “We are a place of business” needed to be stated, but better late than never. I can’t believe they let these goofs occupy Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian’s office for 8 hours before having them arrested. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=google%20employees%20arrested&amp;src=typed_query\">They look and act like college students doing a sit-in</a> at the dean’s office, not professional employees protesting their CEO. In college you pay to be there — students are the customers, ostensibly. At work they pay you, at will.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/18/google-fires-28\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8ea646d46798447934e06a097a3bfa58b8513f98e45352956dc2280cf759d210","category":"Tech"}
