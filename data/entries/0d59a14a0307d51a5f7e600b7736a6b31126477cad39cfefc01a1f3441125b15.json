Besides an M4 chip, the new Air is rumored to get a 12MP Center Stage camera, like the one in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2510333/14-inch-m4-macbook-pro-review.html\">M4 MacBook Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting new tidbit: Gurman doesn’t think that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">M2 MacBook Air</a>, Apple’s most affordable laptop, will be replaced by an M3 Air, citing production issues with the M3. Since Apple still makes M2 chips (used in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365408/11-inch-ipad-air-m2-review.html\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2231451/apple-vision-pro-review.html\">Vision Pro</a>) it makes sense for Apple to keep the M2 MacBook Air around. Gurman doesn’t address whether it would get a price reduction, but Apple’s history suggests that it won’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, Gurman reported that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">Mac Studio</a> was originally scheduled to be released at the same time as the M4 MacBook Air, but Apple rescheduled it to a time between March and June. Gurman now states that the Mac Studio release could occur “during the first half of the year,” a statement that’s less specific than before but covers his bases should Apple reconsider a joint release with the M4 MacBook Air. The Mac Studio will be upgraded to the M4 Max and Ultra chips and incorporate <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2064049/what-is-thunderbolt-5-bandwidth-speeds.html\">Thunderbolt 5</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to, as Gurman puts it, “later in the year” when Apple releases the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2552098/m5-macbook-pro-design-processor-specs-release.html\">M5 MacBook Pro</a>. If Apple sticks to previous release dates, it will happen in late October or early November. Besides an M5 chip update, Apple isn’t going to introduce any other new features; the company is saving those for 2026 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also reports that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">M5 Mac Pro</a> “is on track to be ready before the MacBook Pro, though the timing isn’t yet clear.” It will feature the M4 Ultra, which goes by the code name of Hidra. No design changes have been reported, but the upgrade to an M4 Ultra will include Thunderbolt 5 implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the only Mac not mentioned in Gurman’s report is the iMac. Apple waited two years to upgrade the M1 iMac to the M3, but upgraded to the M4 after only a year. In this case, the upgrade was seemingly part of the company’s desire to reduce production of the M3, so it may be back on a two-year cycle and may not get upgraded until 2026. No mention of an iMac with a larger display was mentioned in Gurman’s report, either. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Rumors</a> have stated that a 32-inch iMac could be released in 2025.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0d59a14a0307d51a5f7e600b7736a6b31126477cad39cfefc01a1f3441125b15","category":"Apple"}
