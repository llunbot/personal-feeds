TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has said it will decide this week whether to invest in the chip designer. By holding Arm's shares, chipmakers will hope to have sway over Arm's management.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJapan-based SoftBank has been preparing for an IPO since its plan to sell Arm to Nvidia became <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/02/ftc-lawsuit-block-nvidia-arm-acquisition/\">subject to regulatory scrutiny</a>. California-based Nvidia in January 2022 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/nvidia-abandons-arm-acquistion/\">abandoned</a> the purchase when it became clear that the deal would be blocked by the FTC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe relationship between Apple and Arm is one of the longest in the chip business â€“ Apple was one of the first companies to partner with the firm when it was founded in 1990, prior to the release of Apple's Newton handheld computer, which used an Arm-based chip.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/14/apples-biggest-hardware-flops/\">Apple's Biggest Hardware Flops of All Time</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe Newton was a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/14/apples-biggest-hardware-flops/\">flop</a>, but Arm wasn't. It went on to develop integrated circuit design data that is generally considered to be the \"blueprint\" for semiconductors. Arm licenses its chip designs to over 500 companies, and its architecture is used in 95 percent of the world's smartphones.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arm/\">Arm</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-inks-new-deal-arm-chip-designer/\">Apple Signs New Deal With Arm to License Chip Designs Beyond 2040</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-signs-new-deal-with-arm-to-license-chip-designs-beyond-2040.2400573/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82bdc1cc4e3112329ff803146b0d8b802598d9bff2723e0bdd18e0f2619a9cc3","category":"Apple"}
