The new system brings the Porsche App Center, a kind of app store for the vehicle,  to all of the new models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt continues to support the standard version of Apple ‌CarPlay‌ and Android Auto. Support for Apple's next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ experience is again conspicuously missing from Porsche's new lineup, and the automaker did not mention it at all during its latest announcement—another bleak sign for the delayed feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNext-generation ‌CarPlay‌ will have deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, climate controls, FM radio, and more. It will also support multiple displays across the dashboard, and offer widgets for apps like Calendar and Weather. In addition, next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to match their vehicles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/\">first previewed next-generation CarPlay</a> at WWDC 2022. Until the end of last year, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/\">Apple's website</a> said that the first vehicles with next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ support would \"arrive in 2024,\" but this did not occur.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAston Martin and Porsche <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/\">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> in late 2023, but neither automaker has announced any vehicles with support for it. Apple continued to highlight next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/\">in WWDC 2024 coding sessions</a> for developers and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-statement-on-next-generation-carplay/\">shared a statement</a> in January reiterating its commitment to the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen it unveiled next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ in 2022, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Nearly three years have gone by since Apple shared that list, however, so it is unclear if it remains entirely accurate.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/porsche/\">Porsche</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay/\">2026 Porsches Still Won't Have Next-Gen CarPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay.2454086/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"37e991f9b49d4a6b5b8eae5ab393a8e3ae0d2cb4eba40506ab48081cb8776884","category":"Apple"}
