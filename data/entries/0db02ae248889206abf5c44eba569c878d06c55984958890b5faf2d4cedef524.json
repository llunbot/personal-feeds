It all starts with the Worldwide Developers Conference at the start of the month, where Apple shows off its upcoming OS releases for the fall, and sometimes a new piece of hardware.  That is accompanied by the first developer betas, so we get to go hands-on with the new operating systems and all the new features they bring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While WWDC dominates the releases from Apple for June, we can still expect the usual slate of Apple TV+ programs and Apple Arcade releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s yearly developer conference lasts for a week, but the big moment is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">opening keynote on June 9</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will reveal the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2766625/ipados-19-release-date-compatilbity-features-beta.html\">iPadOS</a>, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS. This year, we’re expecting to see a huge design overhaul made to make each of the different Apple devices look and behave more similarly, so it’s easier to move between them. They might all get a new name to bring them to 26 (to match the year), and there will almost certainly be a number of “powered by Apple Intelligence” features, like an AI-powered battery optimization feature and an AI-powered health coach. There may also be a dedicated Gaming app. For more on the expected OS updates, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 19 guide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">macOS 16 guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be able to watch the keynote on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/events\">Apple’s site</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/apple\">Apple’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We might even get a peek at one of Apple’s new categories of home devices, something many have taken to calling “HomePad.” It’s a small, inexpensive, square iPad-like device that doesn’t have an App Store, it just runs some Apple services to serve as a smart home hub. Apple has introduced new Macs at WWDC in the past, as well, though we haven’t heard any rumors that a release is imminent, so probably not this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
