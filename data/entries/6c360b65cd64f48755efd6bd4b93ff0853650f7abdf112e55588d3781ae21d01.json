Apple has reportedly been planning its own modem since at least 2018, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/\">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn April, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said mass production of Apple's modem <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/iphone-se-4-rumors/\">would begin in 2025 at the earliest</a>, suggesting that even iPhone 16 models launching later next year will continue to use Qualcomm modems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo had previously claimed that the next iPhone SE would have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/kuo-iphone-se-4-oled-display/\">similar design as the standard iPhone 14 model</a> released last year, suggesting that the device would have been equipped with a 6.1-inch OLED display and Face ID. It's not entirely clear if Apple will move forward with launching this device with a Qualcomm modem at some point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current iPhone SE was released in March 2022 with a 4.7-inch LCD display, Touch ID, 5G, a 12-megapixel rear camera, and the A15 Bionic chip. Priced starting at $429 in the U.S., it is one of Apple's more affordable iPhone models. The first-generation and second-generation iPhone SE were released in 2016 and 2020, respectively.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/\">Barclays</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/new-iphone-se-unlikely-in-2024/\">New iPhone SE Considered 'Unlikely to Launch' in 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-se-considered-unlikely-to-launch-in-2024.2393615/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6c360b65cd64f48755efd6bd4b93ff0853650f7abdf112e55588d3781ae21d01","category":"Apple"}
