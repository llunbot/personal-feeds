It comes in six different models which vary in price from £3,999 to £9,599 and, while it looks a lot like a number of other highly integrated <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/1850/best-aero-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aero road bikes</a>, it stands out thanks to a unique tool storage box slung under the down tube, one that isn't actually UCI-legal.</p>\n<p>The Orca Aero comes in a range of different builds, offering a choice of SRAM Red eTap AXS, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sram/9438/sram-force-etap-axs-groupset-review\">SRAM Force eTap AXS</a> and SRAM Rival eTAP AXS or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/9947/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100-shimano-finally-goes-12-speed\">Shimano’s new 12-speed groupsets</a>, Dura-Ace Di2 R9270 and Ultegra Di2 R8170 or R8000.</p>\n<p>Based in the Basque country, Orbea turned its hand to bikes in 1930 and made its debut at the Tour de France in 1934. It has been a renowned name in performance cycling ever since.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orbea_orca_aero_2_0.jpg?itok=0Oi4EJr4\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>2022 Orbea Orca Aero: Aero gains and built-in storage</h2>\n<p>Designed for ‘superior ergonomics’, the new Orca Aero claims to be the perfect balance of aerodynamics, stiffness and weight.</p>\n<p>It features a horizontal top tube and chainstays which Orbea says improves airflow and the fork has been redesigned to minimise turbulence and drag.</p>\n<p>The down tube and seat tube profile have been aerodynamically optimised for 25-28mm tyres but the bike also has clearance for 30mm tyres, making the new Orca Aero more versatile than its predecessor.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orca_aero_m10iltd-19.jpg?itok=ill4AoVI\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>According to the brand, the drag around the rear wheel has been reduced by aligning the upper seat tube junction with the airflow and the new aero handlebar, stem and 50mm carbon seatpost also reduce drag by 2%.</p>\n<p>All of this aerodynamic innovation combines to reduce drag by 15W at 40kmh or 28W at 50kmh according to Orbea.</p>\n<p>The frame weighs 1,150g and the brand promises that it is ‘one of the most efficient, fastest aero frames on the market’, as the bike’s new shorter wheelbase makes it more responsive whilst the shorter chainstays means better acceleration.</p>\n<p>The new Orca Aero features an integrated toolbox positioned behind the front wheel and an aero bottle and cage, all of which are removable to suit tastes, but Orbea says the bike is faster with both in place.</p>\n<p>Of note is that the toolbox isn't UCI-legal, so riders will need to remove this before racing.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/1015/paris-roubaix-all-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix 2021: Route, start list and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/4470/where-paris-roubaix-2021-will-be-decided-part-4-roubaix-velodrome\">Where Paris-Roubaix 2021 will be decided, part 4: Roubaix Velodrome</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10138/paris-roubaix-weather\">Will it rain at Paris-Roubaix 2021?</a></div>    </div></div><div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orbea_orca_aero_7.jpg?itok=-M66tOiA\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>2022 Orbea Orca Aero geometry</h2>\n<p>The Orca Aero’s position is aggressive which Orbea says is to maximise aerodynamics and to generate as much power and speed as possible.</p>\n<p>The bike comes in seven sizes ranging from 47 to 60cm. Reach and stack for a size 55cm are 391mm and 562mm respectively while head tube angles range from 71 to 73.3 degrees across the size range.</p>\n<p>Made from OMX Carbon which Orbea says ‘ensures the best performance’, the Orca Aero comes with over 28 handlebar and stem combinations and the integrated stem is available in seven lengths.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orbea_orca_aero_11_0.jpg?itok=T4IhK0Id\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Orbea has also redesigned the faceplate and computer mount by adding tilt adjustment so a rider can position their computer exactly how they wish.</p>\n<p>The new handlebar is available in four widths, from 360mm to 420mm, and gives up to 15 degrees of tilt adjustment for ultimate comfort whilst riding.</p>\n<p>The slick, minimalistic design comes in three colour options (red wine/carbon raw, silvergreen/black, borealis blue/carbon raw) and there is the opportunity to customise the bike using Orbea’s MyO programme.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\nVideo of LONG LIVE ORCA AERO</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Orca Aero specs, prices and availability</h2>\n<h3>Orca Aero M10iLTD</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orca_aero_m10i_ltd.jpg?itok=JSsd4C9X\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameset:</strong> OMX Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9270 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Shimano Dura-Ace C50</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Autumn</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £9,599 / $9,999 / €9,599</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orca Aero M11eLTD</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orca_aero_m11e_ltd.jpg?itok=UpjLuewB\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameset:</strong> OMX Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Red eTap AXS 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Vision SC 40 Disc Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Autumn</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £8,299 / $8,999 / €8,299</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orca Aero M21eLTD</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orca_aero_m21e_ltd.jpg?itok=wmJg-0jm\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameset</strong>: OMX Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Force eTap AXS 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Vision SC 40 Disc Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Autumn</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £5,799 / $6,299 / €5,799</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orca Aero M20iLTD</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orca_aero_m20i_ltd.jpg?itok=WWQ2xElX\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameset:</strong> OMX Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Shimano Ultegra Di2 R8150 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Vision SC 40 Disc Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Autumn</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £5,799 / $6,299 / €5,799</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orca Aero M31eLTD</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orca_aero_m31e_ltd_pwr.jpg?itok=MLVzQlGs\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameset:</strong> OMX Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Rival eTAP AXS 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Fulcrum Racing 400</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Autumn</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,799 / $5,299 / €4,799</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orca Aero M20LTD</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/orca_aero_m20ltd.jpg?itok=naImz2BK\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameset:</strong> OMX Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Shimano Ultegra R8000 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Fulcrum Racing 400</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Autumn</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,999 / $4,499 / €3,799</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/road-bikes\">Road bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4962499efd98adcef0440b390f88b47c1da7ab599dc2ae1cf11fc2545e79a5b4","category":"Cycling"}
