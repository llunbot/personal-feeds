{"title":"Here Are All the Apple Deals You Can Still Take Advantage of in Time for Christmas","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/all-the-apple-deals-in-time-for-christmas/","date":1639585099000,"content":"We're just ten days away from Christmas, placing us firmly in the last-minute holiday shopping season. Over the past few weeks MacRumors has been tracking all of the best Apple-related deals going on this season, and although many have now expired, there are a few left that you still have a chance of receiving before the 25th.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/Holiday-Deals-1.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShoppers should note that most of the deals listed below are available from third-party retailers like Amazon and B&amp;H Photo. The deadlines for ordering directly from Apple have come and gone for many products due to demand and supply shortages. You can see the full list of items still offering Christmas delivery on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/holiday-shipping\">Apple.com</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn regards to the deals listed below, also take note that while these are all discounted, they may not be the best sales we've ever seen. However, if you missed Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals on these products and need them in time for Christmas, these are the absolute best deals you'll find right now.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, in regards to shipping and delivery dates, remember that these are constantly shifting and being updated across every retailer. What was in stock and delivering before the 25th when this article goes live may completely sell out or be pushed past a Christmas delivery just mere hours later. If you see something you want, now is the time to buy.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Pro</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple's AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case are available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$179.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $249.00.
