{"title":"Reuters on Apple’s Personalized Siri Apple Intelligence Delay","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-says-some-ai-improvements-siri-delayed-2026-2025-03-07/","date":1741386947000,"content":"\n<p>Stephen Nellis, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some artificial intelligence improvements to Apple’s voice\nassistant Siri will be delayed until 2026, the company said\non Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They put 2026 in the headline too (“Apple Says Some AI Improvements to Siri Delayed to 2026”). I don’t mean to be overly pedantic but that’s <em>definitely not</em> what their on-the-record statement says. Apple’s statement reads, “we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year”, by which they mean the next 365 days from now.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s statement doesn’t mention iOS 19 (or MacOS 16) specifically. Apple doesn’t acknowledge future versions like that. But that is what they mean, trust me. And iOS 19 should be announced at WWDC in June, and released in mid-to-late September, if the company sticks to their patterns from recent years. So are these personalized Siri features going to be a 19.0 thing? If not, 19.1, 19.2...?</p>\n\n<p>This year with iOS 18, last year with iOS 17, and in 2022 with iOS 16, the “.0” release shipped in mid-September, the “.1” in late October, and the “.2” in early December. I don’t know where Vegas would set the betting line on when these features will actually ship in iOS 19, but they should have three release windows for iOS 19.0/1/2 in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Hairsplitting, I know, but Reuters is stating 2026 authoritatively and that’s not what Apple is saying. (CNBC has 2026 in their headline too, but not <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/apple-delays-siri-ai-improvements-to-2026.html\">in the text of Kif Leswing’s report</a>.) But it <em>could</em> be 2026 until we see these features without Apple letting today’s new anticipated ship date pass.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/07/reuters-siri-delay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6be4f0cade4696fd0d4472aea1791697cb69e3aa869c9706366712ec2e799b7f","category":"Tech"}
