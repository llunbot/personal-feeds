{"title":"Apple Account Purchase Migration Doesn’t Transfer TestFlight Enrollments","link":"https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/113991894534107860","date":1739481347000,"content":"\n<p>Sean Heber, of The Iconfactory:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It appears that Apple’s new account migration stuff does NOT work\nfor TestFlight access. That by itself is fine - whatever. The\nproblem here is that it appears when someone does an account\nmigration, it kind of half-migrates TestFlight somehow.</p>\n\n<p>People are telling us their new email address to invite but\nTestFlight thinks they’re already a tester with that email\naddress! So you can’t just reinvite them. It seems we have to filter for\nthe user, remove them, then add them as a new tester.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Heber subsequently <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/113991948583471243\">replied to his own thread</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>lol - update. We tried this with a tester. I removed them from\nTestFlight and then re-added with their new email. They got the\ninvite and then the TestFlight app said they can’t be added\nbecause they’re already on TestFlight with the email address that\nwas just invited.</p>\n\n<p>The workaround was to generate a public TestFlight link and use\nthat. My guess is it uses some kind of token as a key for that\nsystem and not their email address. Seems to work around it.\nExcept now there’s a public link. At least I can limit how many\ncan use it and only those who migrated and need a reinvite will\nget this link for now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry/113992059015348611\">His colleague Craig Hockenberry</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you’re hearing from testers about being kicked out of\nTestFlight because of the new account migration stuff, DO NOT\nupdate their email. It’s a lot of work and will not help them.</p>\n\n<p>For now, you MUST give them a public link, even if it’s a\nprivate beta.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>TestFlight enrollment <em>is</em> on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Cdespinosa/113993498493892147\">the list of things</a> that you’re warned are not included with migration (the other two are personalized recommendations and the ability to edit App Store reviews you’ve left with your secondary account), but it sounds like the post-migration TestFlight situation is a little worse than just “not migrated, start over”. You need some actual assistance from the developer of each app you’re testing. (I’m an edge case, to be sure, but I’m enrolled in about 30 active TestFlights across Mac and iOS.)</p>\n\n<p>Still, though, it seems like practical experience with this purchase migration has gone well for almost everyone. I think Apple might have nailed this.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/apple-account-purchase-migration-doesnt-transfer-testflight-enrollments\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ef3bc87464ba96a87153ece229a2d14586a47ef87cdda921a4b52a822d1b918f","category":"Tech"}
