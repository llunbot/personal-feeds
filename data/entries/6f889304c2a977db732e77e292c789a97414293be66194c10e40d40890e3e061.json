In <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-celebrates-105-years-of-americas-national-parks/&amp;xcust=1-1-354056-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s announcement</a>, CEO Tim Cook is quoted as saying, “With every passing year, our national parks only become more precious. We’re honored to play a small role in helping even more people explore the parks, learn about their history, and renew their love and appreciation for the planet we share.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s week-long celebration looks a lot like last year’s: there are special features and collections across most of Apple’s services, and a $10 donation from Apple to the National Park Foundation for every purchase made with Apple Pay. Here’s a summary of what Apple has in store from August 25 through August 29.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>$10 donations to the National Parks Foundation </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For every purchase made using Apple Pay on apple.com, the Apple Store app, or at an Apple Store in the U.S., Apple will donate $10 to the National Parks Foundation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fine print, Apple notes that this is limited to the first 100,000 transactions and there’s a minimum purchase price of $10. In effect, Apple will donate no more than $1 million this way. Apple has almost $200 billion in cash on hand, so this feels more like a marketing gimmick than a sincere effort to bolster the National Parks Foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Watch</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231140/how-to-get-all-of-the-apple-watch-activity-challenge-badges.html\">guide to Apple Watch activity challenges</a>, you can earn a special badge (and animated stickers for Messages) by completing a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile or more on August 28.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Music</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has curated a special “<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/nature-awaits/pl.e4a890520c8e461ba18c18ca29cdec68&amp;xcust=1-1-354056-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Nature Awaits</a>” playlist.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Watch Now section of the TV app, look for the “<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://tv.apple.com/us/room/room/edt.item.60f87ff9-3351-4570-8c0e-1585a7968935&amp;xcust=1-1-354056-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Celebrating our National Parks</a>” collection.
