You have to decide what type of helmet you want, what price bracket you’re looking at and get one that fits both your head and your needs. If being fast is your main priority, then maybe you’ll want a more aerodynamic helmet. If you ride in warmer climates or have a tendency to overheat, ventilation will be key. Sometimes it’s just about budget and getting the best helmet at the price you can afford.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While priorities may vary, there are some things a good helmet always needs. It has to have a reliable and effective impact protection system and needs to fit you well, with some riders suiting different shapes better than others. There’s a lot of options to choose from so we’ve collated the best of our tried and tested road cycling helmets to help you find the right one. Stick around ’til the end to read our in-depth buying advice.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

Using a fabric tape measure is easiest but if you don’t have one to hand, you can use anything that you can wrap around your head and then measure it when laid flat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule of thumb is to measure above the eyebrows, keeping the tape measure level all the way around your head, though it’s worth checking individual brands as this sometimes varies. When you have your measurement, try and find the category where your size sits roughly in the middle. This isn’t always possible but it will allow the most amount of adjustment options to tailor the fit to your preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all helmets will have some degree of fit adaptability, we all have different head shapes so it’s always best to try on a helmet in person if possible as some styles will suit you better than others and an ill-fitting helmet will reduce its safety benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is the best helmet safety system?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"865\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04-970x865.jpg\" alt=\"Helmet safety design on a computer screen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04-970x865.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04-300x268.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04-768x685.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04-1536x1370.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04-750x669.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04-1140x1017.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135355/met_helmets_04.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All helmets must meet certain minimum standards which vary slightly by territory, but these set the bar relatively low, and it’s up to manufacturers to decide how to make their designs as safe as possible. Many cycling helmets feature specific branded safety tech that aims to improve performance in real-world crash scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s much debate on what the best helmet safety system is, with each brand laying a stake that theirs is among the best. Mips is the most established independent crash protection system but that doesn’t make it the safest by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all helmets use an expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam liner with a polycarbonate shell which are designed to break under impact and dissipate the impact away from your head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an additional impact protection system in place builds on this framework. As each brand will understandably say that their system is the best and reviewers can’t test the structural integrity of each helmet, it’s best to rely on independent data like the Virginia Tech scoring system for impartial advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more in-depth break down, read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">best helmet safety systems</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a Virginia Tech score?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Virginia Tech is a public grant research university based in the US that carries out extensive testing on helmets across disciplines ranging from equestrianism to white water rafting to, of course, cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lab produces independent results based 24 impact tests, where the helmets undergo crash simulation, aiming to reproduce the most common cycling-related accidents. The lower the score, the better the helmet’s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A helmet not having a Virginia Tech score isn’t a reflection on its safety however, it just means it hasn’t been tested yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, while the scores are a very useful guide, it’s important to note that any testing protocol relies on specific assumptions about what constitutes good performance, and some helmet makers will doubtless disagree with Virginia Tech’s findings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do more vents mean better ventilation?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03010653/specialized-sworks-prevail-ii-vent-helmet-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Helmet with many vents\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While more vents may seem an easy to way to get better ventilation, there isn’t a direct correlation between the number of ports and their performance. The vents must be the correct size and at the correct angle to allow lots of air into the helmet and they need to be combined with functional internal channels to direct the flow around the head. The helmet also needs efficient rear exhaust ports to dispel the hot air to keep the head cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s often hard to tell on paper how well a helmet’s ventilation system will perform, which is where reviews come in handy, though checking for the above elements will help give you a general idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need an aero helmet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No one wants to turn down free speed and those that prioritise performance above all else would do well to choose a helmet with aero credentials for those marginal gains. If you’re not racing however, it’s worth weighing up some of the compromises that often come with aero lids. They are typically more expensive and sometimes heavier, due to the larger surface area, and there’s usually at least some ventilation penalty compared to a similar ‘non-aero’ helmet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to choose is to pick your top priorities, be they keeping cool, buying on a budget, comfort etc, and finding a helmet that promises the best combination of these attributes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Will spending more money get me a better helmet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More money doesn’t always equal better performance, as much for helmets as for everything else in life, but it can mean you get a better combination of desirable qualities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A brand may not be able to include a top-tier impact protection system while keeping the weight down for an entry-level price but can spend more on R&amp;D for a more expensive product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is typically common with elements like aerodynamics and ventilation that can counteract each other due to the inherent nature of their design so take more time and money to implement cohesively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a helmet that does everything to an exceptionally high standard, then you’ll probably have to pay top dollar as a result, but great helmets can be obtained at more affordable prices if you can select the properties that are most important to you and choose accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other features to consider</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Weight </strong>– anything below 260g for a size medium can be considered lightweight for a road helmet, though weight is largely indiscernible when worn given how small the margins are.</li><li><strong>Strap design</strong> – having individual adjustment points for each chin and ear strap will help you tailor the fit to your head shape and stop the straps sitting uncomfortably.</li><li><strong>Padding </strong>– working out whether you prefer slimmer or thicker padding will help narrow down your helmet choices. If you run warm, finding good sweat-wicking padding is also key to keeping you comfortable on hot rides.</li><li><strong>Ponytail hole</strong> – for anyone with long hair, a helmet with a sufficient ponytail hole is crucial as, without it, your hair can interfere with where the helmet sits on your head or clash uncomfortably with the adjustment system.</li><li><strong>Sunglasses storage</strong> – while most vents can serve as some sort of sunglasses storage, dedicated eyewear ports will usually have added features to help hold the glasses in place making them less likely to fall out while riding.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Got your safety sorted and now want to get ready for your next big adventure?
