Any new product launch from Google is no longer a reason for optimism; instead, the company is met with questions about when the product will be shut down. It's a problem entirely of Google's own making, and it's yet another barrier that discourages customers from investing (either time, money, or data) in the latest Google thing. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/\">wide public skepticism</a> of Google Stadia is a great example of the problem.</p>\n<p>A Google division with similar issues is Google Cloud Platform, which asks companies and developers to build a product or service powered by Google's cloud infrastructure. Like the rest of Google, Cloud Platform has a reputation for instability, thanks to quickly deprecating APIs, which require any project hosted on Google's platform to be continuously updated to keep up with the latest changes. Google Cloud wants to address this issue, though, with a new \"<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-api-stability-tenets-govern-google-enterprise-apis\">Enterprise API</a>\" designation.</p>\n<p>Enterprise APIs basically get a roadmap that promises stability for certain APIs. Google says, \"The burden is on us: Our working principle is that no feature may be removed (or changed in a way that is not backwards compatible) for as long as customers are actively using it. If a deprecation or breaking change is inevitable, then the burden is on us to make the migration as effortless as possible.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783100#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783100&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df0aa474517af4818fab9c4ba4cf653dd4ad454b0166346673d6b4d37b3ac60e","category":"Tech"}
