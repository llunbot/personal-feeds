I’m excited for users to have a choice finally.”</p>\n\n<p>Google — which holds 93% of the global search engine market\nshare, according to analytics company StatCounter — is on\nMicrosoft’s heels. On Monday, the search company said it is\nworking on Bard, a similar chat tool that generates responses from\nweb-based information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/06/bard\">Again</a>, you’d be a fool to count Google out in this race. But shipping talks and bullshit walks. Microsoft is opening up the new Bing to real people now. Not so with Bard.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/07/stern-nadella-bing-openai\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a13a6a128b9cc11da7c4ec32f0c8d5538548d1a68f328a24ba2152c943532cbd","category":"Tech"}
