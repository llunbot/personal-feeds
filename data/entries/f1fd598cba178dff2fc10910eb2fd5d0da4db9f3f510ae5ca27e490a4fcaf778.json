In 2006, the QuickStep-Innergetic team lined up with strongman <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/i-suffered-less-at-roubaix-than-flanders-tom-boonen-in-retirement\">Tom Boonen</a> in their ranks who the year prior had won the E3 Saxo Classic, Paris-Roubaix, two Tour de France stages and capped off the season by securing the World Championship rainbow bands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a race that had been dominated by sprinters it was no surprise that the squad went into the race trying to get the Belgian from an eighth place in 2005 to the top spot as one of the favourites. Towards the pointy end, a small break had already formed with the team’s American rider Guido Trenti involved. Fränk Schleck was driving the pace though and left them behind as they all headed full speed towards the decisive ascent of the Poggio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was here that Alessandro Ballan attacked, but Quick-Step’s Filippo Pozzato followed, and the pair were soon joined by Igor Astarloa and three more fellow escapees as they zipped down the descent towards the finish. They’d set the cat amongst the pigeons for the sprint teams behind but became disjointed at a vital moment in the last two kilometres and started looking at each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the speeding mass nipped on the heels of the last two breakaway riders coming into the final 300m, Pozzatto still managed to keep from their clutches and kicked away once more. He was caught but not consumed by the bunch. If you just looked at the photos, you could assume it was a standard sprint finish. It was anything but. He raised his arms in the air as he crossed the line for victory, with teammate Boonen following suit as he finished fourth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milan-San Remo would be the one race Boonen would never add to his <em>palmarès</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1700\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-970x644.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-768x510.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-1536x1020.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-2048x1360.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-750x498.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-1140x757.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-990384240-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim De Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just two years later, there would be another outlier, which coincided with a moving of the finish line for the first time in 59 years due to road works on the Via Roma. Multiple attacks exploded from the peloton after the Cipressa but a five-man breakaway continued including Paolo Bettini, Davide Rebellin and Thomas Löfkvist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquigas and Française des Jeux began to increase the pace to reel in the riders out in front on the Poggio. The pace combined with repeated attacks weakened the legs of sprinters and things were back together over the top of the climb. FDJ’s Philippe Gilbert tried to launch an attack on the descent with CSC’s Fabian Cancellara on his wheel and they separated a large bunch from the rest of the peloton. More attacks occurred in the front group and Cancellara briefly followed an attempt from Iñigo Landaluze before launching his own effort in the last 3km. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best time-triallists in the world locked in and TTed to the new finish line for victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The two outliers (10% of the time):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2006:</strong> Filippo Pozzato (Quick-Step–Innergetic)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2008:</strong> Fabian Cancellara (Team CSC)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-7-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Solo from the Poggio: 15% of the time</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-933065250-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Poggio is an ideal launching pad for late attacks in an attempt to avoid a bunch sprint. The top of the climb sits 7km from the finish and is only 3.7km in length with an average gradient of 3.7% – hitting a max 8% in the final third. What follows is a technical descent that has seen both sides of the scale, with hard crashes and attacks for glory all intertwined in its legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as the second half of a 1-2 punch off the back of the preceding Cipressa (5.6km, 4.1%). No one has won from an attack there since Gabriele Colombo in 1996 thanks to the flat drag that lies between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last 20 years only three riders have been able to launch a successful solo attack using the Poggio: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vincenzo-nibali-cyclist\">Vincenzo Nibali</a> for Bahrain-Merida in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/milan-san-remo-2022-photos\">Matej Mohorič ft. dropper post</a> for Bahrain Victorious in 2022 and Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Mathieu van der Poel emulating his grandfather Raymond Poulidor in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Poggio and sprint combination…</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There have also been a few instances of riders using the Poggio to break away while still contending in a bunch sprint at the finish. In 2012, Simon Gerrans rode to victory out of an impressive three-man group with Cancellara and Nibali. The same happened for Michał Kwiatkowski in 2017 as himself, Peter Sagan and Julian Alaphilippe engaged in a triple bike throw for the ages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2020 edition Wout van Aert and Alaphilippe broke away on the Poggio for a two-man duel to the line. The following year Jasper Stuyven gapped the field on the climb but was caught by Søren Kragh Andersen in the final kilometre, however he still had enough in the tank to launch a sprint that kept the charging Caleb Ewan at bay by a whisker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Editions won solo from the Poggio:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2018:</strong> Vincenzo Nibali

finish to Milan-San Remo over the past 20 years – happening three quarters of the time – has been a sprint finish, whether it be mano-a-mano, three-up sprints or full bunch sprints. In this timeframe it’s Óscar Freire who was the most successful, winning twice in 2007 and 2010, beating Boonen into third and second on those occasions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most memorable sprint finishes came in 2013 for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-snow\">the snowiest edition</a> of Milan-San Remo. Pummelling rain turned into freezing snow and the race was neutralised, riders piling into team buses towards a new location to restart. It eventually continued despite the numbers of abandoned riders and Ian Stannard would be the one to attack on the foot of the Poggio. He eventually helped form a group with the likes of Sylvain Chavanel, Peter Sagan and Cancellara but it was Gerald Ciolek of MTN-Qhubeka who reigned victorious in the sprint on a day that will be remembered for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best sprinters have won on the Via Roma, including Mark Cavendish in 2009 and Alexander Kristoff in 2014. The most recent edition came down to a sprint finish when, thanks to some impressive work from Van der Poel and Alpecin-Deceuninck, Jasper Philipsen claimed his first Monument ahead of Jayco-AlUla’s Michael Matthews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The likelihood of sprint finishes is dependent on two things: the chance of attacks on the ascent or descent of the Poggio, and the strength of sprinters’ teams after almost 300km in the saddle to neutralise them. In recent years, the increase of attacks has upped in frequency thanks to the types of riders starting now like Tadej Pogačar and Mathieu van der Poel. Despite his attacking abilities Milan-San Remo is one that has evaded Pogačar, who, like Boonen, has this race <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/missing-wins\">missing from his palmarès</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone has a realistic chance of winning through an attack and teams will make it extra-hard on the Poggio to try to dispatch the sprinters. Perhaps Pogačar should change an expected Poggio attack in 2025 to the Cipressa…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the face of more attacks on the Poggio, a sprint finish remains the most common way of winning Milan-San Remo over the past two decades. But is the sprinter’s Classic undergoing a transformation away from this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Editions won by a sprint finish:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2005:</strong> Alessandro Petacchi (Fassa Bortolo)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2007: </strong>Óscar Freire (Rabobank)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2009:</strong> Mark Cavendish (Team Columbia-High Road)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2010:</strong> Óscar Freire (Rabobank)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2011:</strong> Matthew Goss (HTC-Highroad)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2012:</strong> Simon Gerrans (Orica-GreenEDGE)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2013:</strong> Gerald Ciolek (MTN-Qhubeka)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2014:</strong> Alexander Kristoff (Team Katusha)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2015:</strong> John Degenkolb (Team Giant-Alpecin)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2016:</strong> Arnaud Démare (FDJ)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2017:</strong> Michał Kwiatkowski (Team Sky)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2019:</strong> Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck–Quick-Step)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2020:</strong> Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2021:</strong> Jasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2024:</strong> Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-win-milan-san-remo\">How to win Milan-San Remo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f1fd598cba178dff2fc10910eb2fd5d0da4db9f3f510ae5ca27e490a4fcaf778","category":"Cycling"}
