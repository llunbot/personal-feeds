But Hiplok is looking to turn the tables, pulling out all the stops to deliver the world’s first angle grinder-proof <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/08/02/best-bike-locks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">portable bike lock</a> – the new Hiplok D1000…</p><h2>Hiplok D1000 heavy-duty city-proof bike U-lock</h2><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21090546/D1000ATTACKTESTINGBOOT1H.jpg\" alt=\"hiplock d1000\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21090546/D1000ATTACKTESTINGBOOT1H.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21090546/D1000ATTACKTESTINGBOOT1H-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21090546/D1000ATTACKTESTINGBOOT1H-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21090546/D1000ATTACKTESTINGBOOT1H-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21090546/D1000ATTACKTESTINGBOOT1H-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21090546/D1000ATTACKTESTINGBOOT1H-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></p><p>Hiplok says their new D1000 will burn out 12 rotary blades before it gives up on protecting your bike. And to protect against traditional methods like bolt cutters, it relies on a square profile hardened steel core. Since you are never going to get it open any other way, the lock comes with three coded keys with a registration and replacement program, and the whole shebang weighs a moderate 4 pounds (1.8kg).</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092629/D1000POUCHENTRY11.jpg\" alt=\"hiplock d1000\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092629/D1000POUCHENTRY11.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092629/D1000POUCHENTRY11-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092629/D1000POUCHENTRY11-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092629/D1000POUCHENTRY11-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092629/D1000POUCHENTRY11-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></p><p>Respected security equipment test house Sold Secure gives the D1000 its new, highest-level Diamond rating for bicycles and motorcycles. “The future of mobile security,” as Hiplok envisions, appears to be just around the corner <span>— the product goes live today on Kickstarter, with backer deliveries slated for next spring.</span></p><h3>Born of necessity: Why does the Hiplok D1000 exist?</h3><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09110355/download-6.jpg\" alt=\"hiplock d1000\" width=\"1108\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09110355/download-6.jpg 1108w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09110355/download-6-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09110355/download-6-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09110355/download-6-120x67.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09110355/download-6-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1108px) 100vw, 1108px\"></p><p>Fueled by COVID and the urge to distance ourselves from others and get outside, cycling has made huge gains in popularity since the start of last year. Around the world, that’s meant a sharp increase in bike theft. One company that insures bikes even reported a <a href=\"https://www.admiral.com/press-office/lock-it-during-lockdown-warning-as-bike-theft-rises-during-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50% increase in theft</a> claims near the start of the pandemic. And as more bikes continue to get stolen, the methods used to steal them continue to evolve.</p><p>Hiplok got hip to that, identifying the problem it set out to solve…</p><blockquote><p>“<em>The recent surge in demand for bicycles has provided even greater opportunity for the professional bike thief and their modes of attack are becoming more sophisticated,</em>” the company’s co-founders said. “<em>We’re sure you’re aware that motorized angle grinders are now frequently used to steal bikes. They can cut through even the highest-rated locks in seconds <span>—</span> a fundamental problem that has, until now, seemed difficult to solve.</em>“</p></blockquote><p>Extensive R&amp;D went into the Hiplok D1000, and it shows in the finished product’s attention to detail. First of all, the square profile steel stops bolt cutters better than a round shape. With the application of new Ferosafe reinforced ceramic composite material layers, Hiplok adds the uber-material <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=graphene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">graphene</a>, 100x stronger than steel and can be as thin as a single atom, to shut down angle grinder attacks.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092353/D1000LOCKINGRMPAVEMENT11.jpg\" alt=\"hiplock d1000\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092353/D1000LOCKINGRMPAVEMENT11.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092353/D1000LOCKINGRMPAVEMENT11-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092353/D1000LOCKINGRMPAVEMENT11-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092353/D1000LOCKINGRMPAVEMENT11-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21092353/D1000LOCKINGRMPAVEMENT11-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></p><p>The Hiplok D1000 also gets the mechanical security advantage of anti-rotation, double locking tabs. That means the U-shaped shackle doesn’t rotate in the body, so you’d have to cut through it twice to remove it from anything. User comfort and convenience features round it out, like the afore-mentioned key replacement program and anti-rattle construction.</p><h3>Hiplok D1000 – Kickstarter details</h3><p>The Hiplok D1000 goes live on Kickstarter today, with the trusted lock maker turning to crowdfunding to gauge consumer interest in a premium lock while also supporting the ramp up of production using new technologies. Calling it “the future of mobile security”, you can support the campaign and get a new lock from £150 (~$200/175€) if you act fast. Ultimately the D1000 is set to retail for a whopping £250.</p><p>If you’ve got a bike that belongs in the future, why have a lock that doesn’t?</p><p><a href=\"https://hiplok.com/d1000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Hiplok.com/D1000</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8b8cf49bb270f3e089e54ddafadac5528834edb7b9e31054432369380b62f207","category":"Cycling"}
