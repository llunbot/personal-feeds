{"title":"DJI Flip The Gauntlet: ActiveTrack Sports Follow-Me Testing","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/03/dji-flip-vs-activetrack-testing.html","date":1743440098000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>The DJI Flip is the second DJI product (after the DJI Neo) to incorporate its fully built-in autonomous tracking capability. Up till these products, you had to have some form of controller involved in order to actively track/follow you for any distance (even back in the old school days when you could use just your phone, it was still a secondary piece of gear). With the DJI Flip and DJI Neo, you can simply tap the buttons on the drone itself, and then off you go, drone in tow.</p>\n<p>But, is it actually any good at that? And, is the more exposed gimbal (compared to the DJI NEO) a liability?</p>\n<p>Obviously, I set out to put that to the test, as always.</p>\n<p>In this video, I put my DJI Flip through The Gauntlet and its five stages, to see how well it handles. It’s notable to see how this compared to the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/09/dji-neo-gauntlet-activetrack-testing.html\">tiny little $199 DJI Neo from just a month ago</a>, on this same course. Both in terms of obstacle avoidance (and crashes), as well as image quality.</p>\n<p>To see how well this drone holds up, hit the play button up above. Even if you don’t care about drones, I suspect you’ll find it entertaining.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"2ad7dc96662c5f364176151055f0fbf41bb950b01f06faa5e58b3e439edcb6ea","category":"Cycling"}
