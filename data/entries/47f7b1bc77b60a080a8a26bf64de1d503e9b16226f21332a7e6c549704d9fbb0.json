So I was\nwrong, too. […]</p>\n\n<p>We may never know what really caused those rumors to spark,\nbut I wonder darkly if it has to do with some sort of stock\npump-and-dump situation. Satellite provider Globalstar’s\nstock <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/13/heres-why-globalstar-stock-just-crashed-12/\">jumped after Kuo’s report</a>, and now it’s crashing\nback to earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s possible that the iPhones 13 do contain a satellite-connectivity-compatible chip, but Apple made no mention of it as a feature. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/apple-plans-to-add-satellite-features-to-iphones-for-emergencies\">Gurman was circumspect</a> about whether the feature would actually ship, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/\">Kuo seemingly reported it as fact</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/iphone-13-satellite-connectivity\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"47f7b1bc77b60a080a8a26bf64de1d503e9b16226f21332a7e6c549704d9fbb0","category":"Tech"}
