{"title":"Yay! Systems Settings will get an interface tune-up in macOS 15","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2343754/systems-settings-to-get-an-interface-tune-up-in-macos-15.html","date":1716500370000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>With macOS 13 Ventura, Apple performed a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/803390/macos-ventura-system-preferences-settings.html\">major overhaul to the System Preferences</a> interface and changed its name to System Settings. The change was an attempt to better unify it more with the design of Settings in iOS, but it ended up creating consternation with users due to the illogical placement of some settings. Two years after the change, Apple is going to tweak the System Settings interface even further with macOS 15–hopefully for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/23/system-settings-getting-shuffled-again-in-macos-15-among-other-ui-tweaks&amp;xcust=1-1-2343754-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">report</a> by AppleInsider, Apple will tweak System Settings so the settings in the left column are arranged “based on priority and overall importance.” In macOS 15, the first group of the System Settings list (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Network) will remain there, but the group that’s led by the General settings will now come after that first group. The Notification group of settings that currently occupies the second slot will be moved further down the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other moves: Wallpaper and display-related settings won’t be stand-alone settings anymore and will be placed with other similar settings; the Privacy and Security pane will be moved to the group that is currently headed by Lock Screen; and Siri and Spotlight settings are moving to the section of the list with Internet Accounts and Game Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other general interface changes include a refresh for AirDrop and a new monochrome menu bar icon for Siri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AppleInsider also reports that a “new” iCloud account setting that’s separate from the current one in Apple ID will be available in the Internet Accounts section. But the report doesn’t clarify how it will be different from the iCloud settings currently found in <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Internet Accounts</em> in macOS 14.5. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From ‘Apple ID’ to ‘Apple Account’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The System Settings revamp also reflects Apple renaming of “Apple ID” to “Apple Account.” Reports that Apple is considering this name change appeared earlier this year, but the change could reflect more than just a new name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to AppleInsider, Apple Account may also implement new interface elements and animations for the two-factor authentication process. Apple is working on a new feature called Printable Account Recovery Summary, but no details were provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about what we could see in the upcoming Mac operating system, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15 superguide</a>.</p>\n\nMac, MacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"464e1528cc2d43cbaf6117c653f9a25508b82ee33fcd9b0059fba798f856bf96","category":"Apple"}
