You can choose to upgrade certain features at the point of purchase.</p>\n<h2>Bafang hub motor and Samsung battery</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s certainly a striking bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the ‘Tourer Range’ we have in for review.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the Wau X Plus is a 6061 alloy frame. The bike is only available in one size and Wau says it will fit riders from 5ft 5in to 6ft 5in.</p>\n<p>Wau claims a 29kg total weight – our scales max out at 25kg, so we’ll have to take the brand’s word for now.</p>\n<p>The X Plus runs off a Bafang Performance Line <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motor</a> located in the rear hub and a 900Wh Samsung battery powers the system.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The controls mounted to the handlebar operate the motor modes and the indicator lights.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>There are five assistance modes, including a Walk mode controlled by a handlebar remote.</p>\n<p>The default display on the Wau X Plus has a black-and-white screen. Our test bike came with a ‘Smart Colour LCD’ display, which is an optional £159 upgrade at the point of purchase. It includes extra functions such as an odometer, power meter and the ability to adjust the bike’s settings such as the assistance levels.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The display’s tilt can be adjusted.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>A ‘Slow Charger’ is included with the bike, which is claimed to charge the battery fully in up to 12 hours.</p>\n<p>You can upgrade to a ‘Supercharger’, which charges the battery to full in less than six hours for an additional £139.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>What is Bike of the Week?</h3>\n<p>Every fortnight, we’ll bring you a detailed first look at one of the latest bikes (or framesets) to arrive at BikeRadar HQ – from road to commuting, gravel to enduro, and anything in between.</p>\n<p>This is our chance to introduce the bike and everything that makes it unique before hitting the road or trails.</p>\n<p>Head to our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/\">Bike of the Week hub</a> for previous editions.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Smart indicator lights</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lights are integrated into the seatstays.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The X Plus features an integrated front <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">bike light</a>, as well as rear indicator lights on the top faces of both seatstays.

The side lights turn on automatically, but they can be switched off if you wish.</p>\n<p>All the lights are powered by the same battery as the motor.</p>\n<h3>Built-in anti-theft alarm system</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike will make a sound if it detects it’s being tampered with when left unattended.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>There’s a 24/7 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-tracker/\">bike tracker</a> feature on Wau’s smartphone app and you can see when and where the X Plus has been, as well as your previous journeys.</p>\n<p>The app will alert you if the bike leaves a specified area you have set. You’ll still need one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lock/\">best bike locks</a> to secure the bike though, and it’s worth noting you need to pay an annual fee for tracking.</p>\n<p>There’s a dual-lock system to secure the battery, which can be removed or replaced easily, and the battery features a hand-held carrier if you need to take it with you.</p>\n<p>The Wau X Plus is supplied with a key fob that has buttons to lock and unlock the system.</p>\n<p>There’s also a button to arm the system. When set, it’ll sound an alarm if the bike is tampered with.</p>\n<h2>A burly build kit</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 100mm
