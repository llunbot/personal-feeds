{"title":"The Kottke.org T-Shirt, a Fine Hypertext Product","link":"https://kottke.org/23/02/kottke-hypertext-tshirt","date":1675811248000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Kottke:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For much of the nearly 25-year lifespan of kottke.org, the site’s\ntagline has been “home of fine hypertext products”. I always liked\nthat it felt olde timey and futuristic at the same time, although\nhypertext itself has become antiquated — no one talks of\nhypertextual media anymore even though we’re all soaking in it.</p>\n\n<p>And so but anyway, I thought it would fun to turn that tagline\ninto a t-shirt, so I partnered with the good folks at Cotton\nBureau to make a fine “hypertext” product that you can actually\nbuy and wear around and eventually it’ll wear out and then you can\nuse it to wash your car. If you want to support the site and look\ngood doing it, <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/p/EGM9Q5/shirt/kottkeorg-hypertext-tee\">you can order a Kottke.org Hypertext Tee right\nnow</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/07/kottke-tshirts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"5dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ea1ad409e058ba01b29c11646592caa0112828490f2c40ae943aad","category":"Tech"}
