Two of our favorites are the New Mexico Agave Century Plant (Agavaceae neomexicana) and Ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens). If you’ve ever seen either one bloom, you know why we get so freaking excited about them. Each pair comes with (1) ocotillo and (1) agave illustration. And there’s a roadrunner (NM state bird) on the sole for good luck :)</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<p>• 7″ cuff length<br />\n• Recover merino wool 60/40 blend, processed in Spain and/or North Carolina and knit in the USA<br />\n• These are slightly thicker in the best way than our previous summer weight socks<br />\n• Unisex fit: MD fits W7-10 and M6-9; LG fits W10-13 and M9-12.5</p>\n<p>These are back in stock and shipping from Santa Fe from <a href=\"https://shop.theradavist.com/products/socks-cactavist-juniper-heather\" target=\"_blank\">The Radavist Webshop</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/weve-restocked-our-cactivist-socks/\">We’ve Restocked Our Cactivist Socks</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9f62cd00ffeae2a8963e9d4a21e8d244a3be3cac224cfb71f5a1fd84b6bc33c9","category":"Cycling"}
