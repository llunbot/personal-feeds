There have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/22/instagram-feed-changes/\">multiple complaints</a> about the Instagram feed over the years, and in 2018, the company did tweak the algorithm to make newer content show up more often.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInstagram has claimed that its algorithm is designed to surface the moments that people care about the most, highlighting posts based on interaction frequency and timeliness, but many Instagram users will likely be happy to have a chronological option.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/instagram-chronological-feed-2022/\">Instagram Reintroducing Chronological Feed Option in 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-reintroducing-chronological-feed-option-in-2022.2326748/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ia_WCXDnVu0:U285jvzpwuw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ia_WCXDnVu0:U285jvzpwuw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4cffcfd30ebf0fbeb922c544407882a585238ec78ccf09238aa3cdc93aa49465","category":"Apple"}
