Lucinda Brand (Baloise Trek Lions) looked to be fighting with the terrain harder than some, but the world champion was in a solid third place by the end of the second lap.</p><p>With Betsema and Worst trading the lead of the race and Brand holding firm for third, Shirin van Anrooij (Baloise Trek Lions) was enjoying a fantastic ride on her way to fourth, while Ceylin Alvarado (Alpecin-Fenix) fought for fifth place after chasing back from an early pit stop.</p><p>Worst put in her race-winning move on the penultimate lap, dropping Betsema like a stone in the dunes, and taking a 12-second buffer through the bell. Worst looked lighter and faster than everyone else as she stretched her advantage through the final lap, and the Dutch rider celebrated a resurgent victory ahead of Betsema and Brand, who maintains her World Cup lead.</p><p>The Netherlands took the top nine spots at the end of the day, Clara Honsinger (Cannondale/Cyclocrossworld) represented the US and the rest-of-the-world in tenth.</p></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2d6fb4c46111beb6f23094bec7a0f74049739986c126f514d62572b8654451a2","category":"Cycling"}
