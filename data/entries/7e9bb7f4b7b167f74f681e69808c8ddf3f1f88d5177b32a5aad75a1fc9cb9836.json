My home in the northwest suburbs of Chicago lies two miles from the Des Plaines River Trail and about three miles from the North Branch Trail. When the weather cooperates, I'm generally furiously pedaling through the woods on my Trek Checkpoint ALR 5 gravel bike.</p>\n<p>So when Trek offered me the chance to ride its top-of-the-line <a href=\"https://fave.co/3q1lUZo\" target=\"_blank\">Domane+ SLR 9 AXS</a> e-bike, I jumped at the opportunity. Yes, the weather can be dodgy during seasonal transitions, but I'd be facing the changing temps and gusting winds astride a carbon-frame gravel bike with carbon wheelsâ€¦ and a 50 Nm electric motor paired with a 360 Wh battery in the downtube.</p>\n<p>But even as I picked up the Domane+ from a local bike shop, one question kept popping up. Why would I want to ride an electric road bike?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940556#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940556&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e9bb7f4b7b167f74f681e69808c8ddf3f1f88d5177b32a5aad75a1fc9cb9836","category":"Tech"}
