The women’s race will be held on Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/olympic-triathlon-marred-by-shambolic-false-start/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"80e4d1cb9ebfbab559bb53abab3d1122938a41a2594bdaff1a71291e05597d80","category":"Cycling"}
