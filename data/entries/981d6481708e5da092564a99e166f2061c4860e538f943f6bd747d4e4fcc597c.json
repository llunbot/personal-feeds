The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, as Apple claimed during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/\">\"Scary Fast\" event</a> on Monday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if the results are for the new iMac or 14-inch MacBook Pro, both of which are available with the standard M3 chip, but performance should be similar for both machines. The results have a \"Mac15,3\" identifier, which <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/apple-ramps-up-testing-of-new-macbooks-ahead-of-summer-launch\">reported</a> was for a laptop with the same display resolution as a 14-inch MacBook Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard M3 chip is equipped with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, and it supports up to 24GB of unified memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Performance.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWe have yet to see any Geekbench results for the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips available in most new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore details to followâ€¦<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/\">Benchmarks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/\">First Benchmark Results Surface for M3 Chip in New Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-benchmark-results-surface-for-m3-chip-in-new-macs.2409507/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"981d6481708e5da092564a99e166f2061c4860e538f943f6bd747d4e4fcc597c","category":"Apple"}
