Of course, if you were to look at aero data alone to determine the best setup for gravel, you could easily be making decisions that would ultimately hinder you, such as opting for a slick tire on a loose or technical course.</p><div id=\"attachment_193783\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-193783\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d.jpg\" alt=\"enve g-series g23 and g27 rim profiles and specs\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-600x401.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-1068x713.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-629x420.jpg 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-600x401.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-1068x713.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/enve-G23-G27-carbon-gravel-race-wheels-2018-d-629x420.jpg 629w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-193783\">Check out Jason’s review of the ENVE G-Series wheels <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/08/08/review-enve-composites-g23-wide-carbon-disc-brake-gravel-wheelset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p></div><p>Or, when it comes to wheel selection, the purpose-built G23 wheel is lighter, more compliant, and offers superior pinch flat protection, all of which can be of greater benefit than a more aero option. We believe that based on the average speeds for most gravel riders, aerodynamic gains are minimal, and making equipment decisions based solely on that will lead to poor performance.</p><p><strong><strong>Vittoria: </strong></strong>Logical question. Aero advantages are most commonly thought to be just in the direction of motion, but often times can come from slight cross winds as well, especially since Gravel courses tend to be routed through open fields. Also, depending on the profile and width of the rim, the tire shape could still be quite round, allowing the aero shape of the rim to still be of benefit.</p><div id=\"attachment_156500\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156500\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3.jpg\" alt=\"Vittoria Elusion Gravel Wheel\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/VittoriaElusionDiscWheels2017-3-600x400.jpg 600w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-156500\">Check out Jason’s review of the Vittoria Elusion Alloy Gravel wheelset <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/04/04/vittoria-elusion-disc-wheels-optimized-for-gravel-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p></div><div><p>Lastly, consider that an aero profile rim is deeper and thus often times more stiff. This can help keep handling snappy, and allow the tire to be more easy to isolate in terms of deformation (which will then effect grip and compliance).</p><p><strong>HED Cycling: </strong>Yes, deeper rims and aero spokes make sense even with wider and knobby tires. Experience tells me I go faster on aero wheels relative to shallow ones on tires up to 42mm wide, so Vanquish 6 pro wheels are what I wear on my bike. I have not ridden wider tires than 42mm on gravel so I can’t tell you if there is an aero break-point where wide tires and knobs overcome rim aerodynamics.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2.jpg\" alt=\"hed jet 6\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jet-RC6-Black_Rear2-420x420.jpg 420w\"></a></p><p>In addition to anecdotal experience, we (HED) had this same question in 2014 so, when we were at the wind tunnel that year, we did a couple runs to get some data. The chart below shows a quick run with our Ardennes Plus wheel and our Jet 6 wheel at 20 mph with a 35mm Conti CX speed tire. The Ardennes is 25mm deep and the Jet 6 is 60mm deep. Both are 21mm internal and 25mm external at the “brake” track. The Jet measured lower drag. At least with a 35mm somewhat knobby tire, aero has measurably lower drag.<strong><br></strong></p><div id=\"attachment_271073\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-271073\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire.jpg\" alt=\"hed ardennes plus versus jet 6 conti cx tires drag measured wind tunnel data\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10025126/hed-cycling-ardennes-plus-versus-jet-6-drag-conti-cx-speed-tire-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-271073\"><strong>Wind Tunnel Testing.</strong> Triangle Data Set: Ardennes Plus w/ Conti CX 35mm Tire; Square Data Set: Jet 6 w/ Conti CX 35mm Tire</p></div></div><p><em>Got a question of your own?
