We're about to tip over into April, and all signs continue to point to the likelihood of a Starship orbital launch attempt this month. I've heard all sorts of dates, but most recently, SpaceX appears to be working internally toward April 10. That lines up with about when a launch license is expected from the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>\n<p>It probably won't happen that soon, but we are <em>pretty</em> darn close, y'all.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets and a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927547#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927547&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab3f203080927898cfb3fab5325360367dbf9c79ad1d857c9f6d62a7da36315f","category":"Tech"}
