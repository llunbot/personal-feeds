And once again, the iPhone 17 Air looks insane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s one thing to read that the phone is less than 6mm thick—it’s another thing to see it. Well-known leaker <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1915300506437849347\">Sonny Dickson</a> has shared dummies of all four iPhone 17 models—the iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max—and you can instantly see how thin the new phone will be: “unbelievably thin,” as Dickson writes. It look to be about half the thickness of the Pro Max and barely thicker than the power button on the side of the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as sizing, the iPhone 17 Air is larger than the 6.1-inch iPhone and iPhone Pro, but smaller than the 6.9-inch iPhone Pro Max. That puts it around the size of the current iPhone 16 Plus, which has a 6.7-inch display.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iphone 17 air leak usb c comparison\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iphone-17-air-leak-usb-c-comparison.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The USB-C port on the iPhone 17 Air (second from top) appears to be slightly off-center.</p></figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1915300506437849347\" target=\"_blank\">Sonny Dickson/X</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We can glean a couple of other things from the dummies as well. As reported, the Phone 17 Air only has one camera, versus two on the standard iPhone 17 and three on the Pro models. Furthermore, there are just two holes on the bottom of the phone where the speaker goes, presumably for microphones. That means the phone won’t have stereo speakers, which has also been rumored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone also appears to have a slightly off-center USB-C port, which is something we also saw on the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2586390/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge.html\">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> dummies. Presumably, this has to do with engineering and space issues, but it’s out of character for Apple to ship a phone with a visual flaw, so we’ll need to see the final product before we jump to conclusions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can stay up to date with the latest rumors ahead of its September launch in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 superguide</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"42fd5a2d2205c3b5cb89f4b82f90ec15a3dc4933842f73cd2f0a686cf17953de","category":"Apple"}
