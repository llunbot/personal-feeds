AirPods 4 do not have ear tips. They sit at the opening of the ear canal. This design leave a little bit of space between the earbuds and the ear canal.

This design creates a seal for the ear canal that muffles outside sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro feature a shorter stem length than the original AirPods.

If not, your only choice is the AirPods 4. If you do want it, then you need to choose between the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and the AirPods Pro 2. (You can always turn off ANC if you don’t want to use it.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do want Active Noise Cancellation, decide whether you want ear tips or not. If you think ear tips are uncomfortable or don’t like the effect they have on sound, then the AirPods 4 with ANC are for you. If you’re fine with ear tips or want to maximize the effect of ANC, then the AirPods Pro 2 are your pick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe, instead you’re most concerned with fit and you’re fine with either ear tips or no ear tips. The AirPods Pro 2’s ear tips help secure the ear buds in your ear. Apple says the AirPods 4 fit better than ever, but they still sit at the opening of your ear canal and are not as secure as the AirPods Pro 2. The only way to insure a proper fit is to try them on before a purchase. If you absolutely want ear tips, your only choice is the AirPods Pro 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have ruled out the AirPods Pro 2 and are deciding between the two AirPods 4 models, the major difference (beside ANC, which you don’t have to use) is the charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC’s case supports wireless charging and has a Find My speaker for alerts. Ask yourself, is the extra $50 worth ANC, wireless charging, and Find My alerts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to use the AirPods as a hearing aid, the AirPods Pro 2 is your choice. Keep in mind that that this feature isn’t available yet and will require a free firmware update that you can do on a Wi-Fi network at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One last consideration is price. The prices in this article are Apple’s list prices; you can often find price reductions at third-party retailers such as Amazon. In fact, the AirPods Pro 2 are often on sale for $190/£190, just $10/£10 more than the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. If you are okay with ear tips, then the AirPods Pro 2 can be had at a good price.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5b287866b74b184d8b69df1aab31bd6baeb0f0d11d3484dee645aea5a85e9017","category":"Apple"}
