Fuji, most of the hyped imagery around Japan is the neon lights of Shibuya Crossing, the crush of bars in Shinjuku’s Golden Gai, or the irrationally popular Running Man sign along Dotonburi canal. That, and the weird food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But get outside the mega-metropolis of Tokyo, temple-filled Kyoto, and deceptively chill Osaka, and there’s a much more interesting side of Japan to discover. And, naturally, the best way to do that is by bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride &amp; Seek offers just such an opportunity with their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride-seek-adds-japanese-samurai-bicycle-tours/\">Samurai Cycling Tour</a>, a two-parter that starts in northern and central Honshu (basically the middle of Japan), then finishes with a tour around Shikoku Island, the large island just west of Osaka. All in, it’s nearly a month of riding, including bonus loops around Mt. Fuji, but you can break it up into parts as needed. If that sounds like fun, here’s everything you need to know, plus stories from our experience riding the Shikoku Islands stage with them in May 2024…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>About Ride &amp; Seek</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-8.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1296\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-8.jpg\" alt=\"cycle japan ride and seek cycling tour van and guides loading bikes.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-8.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-8-297x192.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-8-1536x995.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-8-120x78.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-8-768x498.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Our guides, Eri and Nate, loading the van for the transfer to the start.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride &amp; Seek is a global cycling tour operator, with multi-day to multi-week tours all over the world. Most have a slight theme based on the location, with the goal being to immerse you into the culture more than you could do on your own. They also handle all on-the-ground logistics and, if needed, can advise on coordinating travel, bicycle transportation, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That logistics part is key, especially in Japan. Not only is the language barrier higher, but finding good hotels in the middle of nowhere is hard. Finding restaurants (any restaurant) that will be open when you need them to be is even harder. And even if they are open, as a foreigner, they may turn you away…not because they don’t like foreigners, but because they’d rather say no than risk providing sub-par service. That, or you needed a reservation so that they could have the food and staff on hand. It’s tricky, but Ride &amp; Seek handles all that and much more for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-51.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-51.jpg\" alt=\"ride and seek support van driving next to cyclists in japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-51.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-51-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-51-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-51-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-51-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a primary team for each location, then contract with vetted locals as needed based on group size. There’s always 1-2 guides riding with the group, and one person (or more, as needed) in support vehicles. For the Japan trip, they covered breakfast and dinner, and we were on our own for lunches most days (see the “food” section further down to see why).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"snack stop on ride and seek cycling tour.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-6.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-6-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"snack stop on ride and seek cycling tour.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-6-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-6-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-6.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They also set up snack stops several times each day, with a mix of local treats, candies, and snacks you’re unlikely to find at home.

Other times it’s a small shop that has local baked goods, jams, jellies, ice cream, and other treats. This is the local knowledge that’s hard to get on your own, which is one of the big perks of an organized tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1271\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-1.jpg\" alt=\"snack stop on ride and seek cycling tour.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-1-297x189.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-1-1536x976.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-1-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-1-768x488.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan has a lot of vending machines that serve both hot and cold coffee, <em>koucha</em> and <em>ocha</em> (black and green teas), but if none are nearby, our guides made pour-over coffee, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-4.jpg\" alt=\"snack stop on ride and seek cycling tour.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-4.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-4-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Snacks are set up at the end of each day’s ride, too, so we could refuel before hitting the <em>onsens</em> (hot baths) and relaxing before getting ready for dinner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-5.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-5.jpg\" alt=\"snack stop on ride and seek japan cycling tour.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-5.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-5-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-5-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-snack-stop-5-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Toilets and vending machines are literally everwhere in Japan, even on the most rural roads.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bathrooms are plentiful, too. Japan has an abundance of public bathrooms, and they’re almost always clean, well-stocked, and many have heated toilet seats with bidets. Oddly, most do <em>not</em> have soap or towels, and hand dryers are sporadic, so it’s a good idea to bring along a small thing of hand sanitizer, or use the one provided by the guides at the snack stops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-11.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-11.jpg\" alt=\"ride and seek daily route previews.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-11.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-11-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-11-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-11-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour-11-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-trip support is excellent, with plenty of documentation. Once we arrived, an information packet had printed details for each day plus common Japanese greetings and phrases, which is a handy reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1784\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"ride and seek app screenshots.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-297x207.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-1536x1070.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-120x84.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-768x535.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-about-the-tour7-2048x1427.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a pre-trip app that has much of the same information if you prefer screen to paper, or just want to have a quick reference to the day’s route while you’re out riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guides also provide daily route files through Ride With GPS, and can help you get them onto your cycling computers, too. You’ll need to create a free RWGPS account in advance, and it’s helpful if you know how to get a route onto your device. Most days offer short and long routes, so you can get more riding and climbing if you want, but typically even the short routes will hit all of the scenic highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Supported, not rushed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1.jpg\" alt=\"riding past samurai statues in japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I liked best about Ride &amp; Seek is that there’s a very loose agenda. You have a breakfast time and a dinner time, and then a whole lot of hours in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were able to ride at our own pace, stop and take as many photos (silly or otherwise) as we wanted, explore the temples and villages, and generally create the experience we wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us, that’s perfect. Even if we weren’t documenting the experience for this story, we like stopping and exploring, as you’ll see in the photos below (plus more on our personal Instas – <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tylerbenedict\" target=\"_blank\">@tylerbenedict</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/collectivewild\" target=\"_blank\">@</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/collective.wild/\" target=\"_blank\">collective.wild</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1900\" height=\"1425\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-2.jpg\" alt=\"cyclists on a curvy mountain road in japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-2.jpg 1900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also perfect because the hammerheads can hammer, and the slower folks can mosey. It means you can bring along friends or family of varying levels and everyone can enjoy the trip. There’s no pressure to keep up, and no expectation to wait up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, everyone should be in good shape and able to comfortably handle 40 to 70 miles/day for 8+ consecutive days, and fix a flat and other little things that may go wrong. As long as you make it to dinner, you can be as autonomous as you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cycling through Shikoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"889\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-3.jpg\" alt=\"aerial view of japan's mountains near osaka.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-3-297x132.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-3-1536x683.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-3-120x53.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-3-768x341.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The view flying into Osaka was a little preview of what was to come.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/where-to-ride-exploring-hidden-japan-by-mountain-bike-in-hakuba-nozawa-onsen/\">mountain biked near Nagano</a>, just east of Ride &amp; Seek’s Honshu Stage of the Samurai Cycle Tour, and it’s rad. For this Shikoku stage, the terrain was completely new to me but, despite being a bit more coastal, it was just as mountainous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our eight days of riding had a claimed 24,800 feet of climbing (7,560m) with an average of just 53 miles per day. That’s a hair over 3k feet of climbing per day, though some days definitely had more than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-22.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-22.jpg\" alt=\"sunrise over Shikoku Island japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-22.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-22-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-22-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-22-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-terrain-22-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan’s population is clustered in the big cities for a reason – it’s impractical to build anywhere else. Their major cities are generally surrounded by either the sea or mountains. Those mountains are so steep, and they get so much rain, that it simply isn’t feasible to build there.

Typically, Japanese do not eat like this – it’s a lot of work. But it’s what you’ll find when staying at traditional-style hotels and ryokans.

And we sought out takoyaki stands when we saw them. It’s pan-fried dough balls with octopus in them, covered in a variety of sauces and seasonings. Very delicious, and a popular snack in Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-88.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-88.jpg\" alt=\"bowls of ramen.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-88.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-88-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-88-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-88-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-88-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A big, hot bowl of pork ramen with the special egg is also a great, filling option. I definitely recommend asking for it <em>oomori</em> (large portion) with an extra serving of pork (a standard serving is usually only 2-3 slices).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112.jpg\"><img width=\"2200\" height=\"1656\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112.jpg\" alt=\"japanese food truck lunch and preparation.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112.jpg 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112-297x224.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112-1536x1156.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112-768x578.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-112-2048x1542.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also strongly recommend looking around. The recommended lunch spot(s) is/are usually a “safe” option, but we found food trucks across the street with way more interesting dishes. This one smoked and seared fresh Bonito right in front of us, then sliced, seasoned, and plated it with pickled vegetables and more. It was amazing, and amazingly cheap…roughly $6 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t be afraid to explore, that’s the reason they leave lunch up to you. Take advantage!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-114.jpg\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1867\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-114.jpg\" alt=\"ninja lager non-alcoholic beer in a bicycle top tube bag.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-114.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-114-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-114-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-114-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-114-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-143.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-143-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"tyler and steve holding ice cream treats from lawsons.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-143-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-143-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-143-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-143-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-143.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"sake tasting.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-205.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"tyler drinking a japanese beer.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-meals-300.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, try the local beverages, and check out the ice cream section at the <em>konbini</em> (convenience stores)…lots of tasty treats there!

Not every store or cafe takes credit cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hotels &amp; Hot Baths</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

Hotels with onsens, of which most had them during our tour, provide robes to wear to and from the baths, and small wash towels that also make great modesty pieces if you’re uncomfortable walking around bare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some outdoor spots with foot soaks, which are co-ed, and occasionally you can find a hot spring feeding into a river that’s public. But most onsens and baths are private and separated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are a highlight of the trip. Soaking after a long ride is amazing, and especially on the cooler days. This trip is offered twice per year, in May and October. The May trip ends just as southern Japan is about to enter its rainy season, so there’s a good chance of sprinkles. We had a couple of days with showers, but nothing serious, and nothing that stopped us from riding. Bring a rain jacket, and soak in the onsen after!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Notes &amp; more photos</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"929\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120.jpg\" alt=\"ride and seek tour guides in japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120-1536x571.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120-768x285.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-guides-120-2048x761.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Our guides: Nate (left, orange-ish jersey) and Eri (right, blue hat).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our guides Nate &amp; Eri were great. Super friendly, happy to help with anything, and had the logistics dialed, bags loaded and unloaded, and hotel check-ins covered before we even finished the ride each day. All we had to do was show up, ride, and enjoy ourselves, which is exactly what you’d want and expect from a full-service guided tour like this. They took turns riding and driving the van, so we got to know each of them…when we could keep up – they’re both rippers up <em>and</em> down the mountain!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-68.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-68.jpg\" alt=\"riding bikes in japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-68.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-68-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-68-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-68-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-68-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a well-structured, expertly-guided cycling tour, I recommend checking out Ride &amp; Seek’s extensive trip catalog. And if you’re interested in Japan, check out their Samurai Cycling Tour. We enjoyed ourselves immensely, thanks both to the guides’ stories and intel, and also because we could explore on our own, too. The route was the right mix of hard and fun, with plenty of short detours to be found if you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-139.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-139.jpg\" alt=\"cafe via shimanami in japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-139.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-139-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-139-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-139-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-riding-139-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Cafe via Shimanami makes great coffee and sells boutique cycling jerseys with regionally-inspired designs from local artists.

They mostly echoed our sentiments, which is impressive considering they ranged in age from late 20s to 82! Plus, everyone’s cycling experience and personal backgrounds varied considerably, too, so the consensus confirmed our opinions in the best way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also made for an interesting week, talking to everyone, making new friends, and sharing our collective photos and stories from each day. It’s always interesting how different people experience the same thing, and I appreciate that there’s always something to learn from others. Sharing meals made that easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Temples and more photos</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-temples-500.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1059\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-temples-500.jpg\" alt=\"temple in japan.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-temples-500.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-temples-500-297x175.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-temples-500-1536x904.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-temples-500-120x71.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ride-and-seek-japan-temples-500-768x452.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We took a LOT of photos.
