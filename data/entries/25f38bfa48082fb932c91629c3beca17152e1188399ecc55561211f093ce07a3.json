{"title":"Amid Antitrust Scrutiny, Microsoft Drops OpenAI Board Observer Seat, and Apple, Reversing Course, Will Not Take One","link":"https://www.ft.com/content/ecfa69df-5d1c-4177-9b14-a3a73072db12","date":1720643728000,"content":"\n<p>Camilla Hodgson and George Hammond, reporting for The Financial Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Microsoft has given up its seat as an observer on the board of\nOpenAI while Apple will not take up a similar position, amid\ngrowing scrutiny by global regulators of Big Tech’s investments in\nAI start-ups.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft, which has invested $13bn in the maker of the generative\nAI chatbot ChatGPT, said in a letter to OpenAI that its withdrawal\nfrom its board role would be “effective immediately”.</p>\n\n<p>Apple had also been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3414cd0d-09e0-4246-a7db-4ef3032af8b8\">expected to take an observer role </a> on\nOpenAI’s board as part of a deal to integrate ChatGPT into the\niPhone maker’s devices, but would not do so, according to a person\nwith direct knowledge of the matter. Apple declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI would instead host regular meetings with partners such as\nMicrosoft and Apple and investors Thrive Capital and Khosla\nVentures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple’s board observer seat, set to be taken by Phil Schiller, was never officially announced. But after <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/07/schiller-openai-board-observer\">Mark Gurman broke the story</a> at Bloomberg, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3414cd0d-09e0-4246-a7db-4ef3032af8b8\">it was confirmed by the Financial Times</a>. So it really does seem like a fast reversal. Or as Emily Litella would say, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZLeaSWY37I\">Never mind</a>”. But I suspect these “regular meetings” will serve the same purpose, and I bet Schiller will be in those meetings representing Apple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also</strong> Reporting for Axios, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/10/microsoft-openai-board-seat-observer\">Ina Fried has excerpts from Microsoft’s letter to OpenAI</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/10/apple-microsoft-openai-never-mind\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"25f38bfa48082fb932c91629c3beca17152e1188399ecc55561211f093ce07a3","category":"Tech"}
