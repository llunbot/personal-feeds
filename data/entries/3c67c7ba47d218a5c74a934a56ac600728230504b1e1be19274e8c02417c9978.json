Lightweight is all relative, especially when talking about affordable ebikes. Rad says the claimed weight of the RadKick belt drive is “under 55lbs”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RadKick comes in two different drivetrains. They come in a 7-speed chain drive flavor, a first for Rad Power. And a single-speed belt drive flavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-belt-drive.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-belt-drive.jpeg\" alt=\"Rad Power Bikes Radkick belt drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-belt-drive.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-belt-drive-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-belt-drive-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-belt-drive-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-belt-drive-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rad decided to offer a belt-driven bicycle for those riders who want a simple, quiet, low-maintenance drivetrain. With the carbon belt drive, it will allow riders to enjoy longer periods between service intervals. A belt drive also eliminates dealing with the mess that can be chain lube. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-at-school-e1723482663942.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"782\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-at-school-e1723482663942.jpeg\" alt=\"Rad Power Bikes Radkick at school\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-at-school-e1723482663942.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-at-school-e1723482663942-297x181.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-at-school-e1723482663942-120x73.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rad-Power-Bikes-Radkick-at-school-e1723482663942-768x469.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RadKick belt drive comes equipped with a responsive torque sensor providing power on request while offering a more natural ride experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Word from the CEO</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Since joining Rad, I have worked closely with our customer service teams, engineers, and quality leaders to reassess our lineup and identify holes that needed to be filled.
