The program, which is available now, is part of the company’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/04/apple-surpasses-60-percent-reduction-in-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions/\">efforts</a> to promote Earth Day on April 22 and lasts until May 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each customer can bring in up to five eligible devices to be recycled and for each they will receive 10% off the price of a new device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offer is available through participating Apple Stores worldwide and applies only to eligible Apple products. Apple provides full details of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/promo/\">Ts&amp;Cs on it’s current offers page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is separate to Apple’s existing Trade-In program by which, if the device is deemed by Apple to have a trade-in value, a store credit will be issued towards the purchase of a new product. Apple’s trade-in scheme applies to devices including iPhones, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac, and the company will even accept the trade in of Android devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, an iPhone 15 Pro Mac is worth up to $630 in trade in value when buying a new product from Apple.
