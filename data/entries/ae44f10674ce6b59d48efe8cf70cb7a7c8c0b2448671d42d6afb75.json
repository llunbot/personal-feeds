The new Blinder lights replace the brand’s range of PWR products.</p>\n<p>Speaking at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/icebike-north-gallery/\">iceBike* North</a>, CEO Hugo Davidson says Knog conducted competitor analysis during Covid to develop the products, settling on a “lumen for dollar” approach with its new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">bike lights</a>.</p>\n<p>The Blinder lights have an aluminium casing, which clips into a low-profile U-shaped mount. All lights have a USB-C charging port.</p>\n<p>The new lights will be available initially as standalone all-in-one units. Lights with external batteries for mountain biking, as well as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike</a> headlights, will follow later in the year.</p>\n<h2>Tesla battery</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lights use a Tesla battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Every light in the revamped range uses batteries that are the same size as Tesla’s 21700 lithium battery.</p>\n<p>The batteries used by Knog have all the same benefits as Tesla’s 21700 battery, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>Knog says run time is the primary concern of most consumers, and the Blinder lights will last 35 to 40 per cent longer than other comparable bike lights.</p>\n<p>The standalone lights are available in 600-, 900- and 1,300-lumen versions. Davidson says the 900-lumen light has a maximum run time of two hours on full beam.</p>\n<p>Davidson says accommodating the moderately larger battery is a negligible trade-off versus the improved run time of the lights.</p>\n<p>Davidson says Knog is the first brand he’s aware of to use the battery in bike lights. He imagines more will adopt the battery in future for its increased capacity.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at £59.95 for the 600-lumen light and rises to £99.95 for the 1,300-lumen light. International pricing is to be confirmed.</p>\n<h2>Beam pattern</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lights use four LEDs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Blinder lights use a combination of LEDs for a direct and wider beam pattern.</p>\n<p>Two LEDs provide a projected beam to light the road or trail immediately in your path, while two other LEDs create a bloom effect to illuminate your wider vision.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/stvzo-bike-lights/\">StVZO</a> versions of the lights will be sold in Germany.</p>\n<p>StVZO lights have grown in popularity beyond Germany and are even specced on bikes such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-cannondale-synapse/\">Cannondale Synapse</a> with its integrated SmartSense system.</p>\n<p>Davidson says Knog may make the StVZO-compliant lights available in other territories.</p>\n<h2>Two mounts</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Blinder comes with two mounts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Blinder lights have an aluminium body, which clips into one of two mounts.</p>\n<p>The first mount has a rubberised band, which can wrap around a handlebar for easy attachment and removal.</p>\n<p>One edge of the U-shaped mount can be pulled easily to remove the light.</p>\n<p>The second mount can be used in tandem with an out-front <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> mount. While it looks similar to the first mount, it has a cam lock to minimise the chance of the light coming loose.</p>\n<p>Davidson says the mount has been tested over cobbles.</p>\n<h2>No cable included</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lights have a USB-C charging port.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Knog Blinder lights charge via a USB-C port. This makes them compliant with EU regulations, which require all new devices such as mobile phones, tablets and bike lights sold in the EU to have a USB-C charging port by the end of 2024.</p>\n<p>The lights won’t ship with cables, instead relying on users already having a USB-C cable.</p>\n<p>Davidson praises the standardisation of cables and charging ports on environmental grounds.</p>\n<p>“I don’t see any reason why we should screw up the environment any more,” he says.</p>\n<h2>Integrated lights</h2>\n<p>There will be versions of the Blinder lights that are compatible with external battery packs in the early autumn.</p>\n<p>These lights will be available with 1,300, 1,800 or 23,00 lumens.</p>\n<p>They could be used with mounted battery packs for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/cycling-at-night/\">mountain bike night riding</a>, but they can also be plugged into an electric bike’s battery.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ae44f10674ce6b59d48efe8cf70cb7a7c8c0b2448671d42d6afb75","category":"Cycling"}
