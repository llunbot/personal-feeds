It's been a big week for rocket failures, with a small launch in Japan going sideways shortly after liftoff, a rare misstep for China's Long March family of rockets, and another Starship flight test. The latter mission was not really a failure, of course, in that the experimental vehicle took a big step toward becoming operational with a nominal first stage performance and good flight of Starship in space.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

Tokyo-based startup Space One failed Wednesday to become Japan's first private firm to put a satellite into orbit after its solid-fuel Kairos rocket burst into flames just seconds after liftoff, <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/japan/science-health/space-one-launch/\">The Japan Times reports</a>. The 18-meter, 23-ton Kairos rocket, carrying a mockup of a government spy satellite, took off from a new space facility in Kushimoto, Wakayama Prefecture. The rocket exploded in midair five seconds after launch, with its remains falling onto a nearby mountainous area<strong>.</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010132#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010132&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9671c6f4bfd7ae16bb9fe7b8c81ca89528d30e63f71073d3f073659135171c1b","category":"Tech"}
