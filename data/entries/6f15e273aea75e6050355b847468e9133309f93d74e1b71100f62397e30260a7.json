The company was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/16/in-person-today-at-apple-classes-resume/\">originally hoping</a> to return to normalcy in its stores in the United States on August 30; however, concerns regarding the health and safety of staff and customers pushed the company to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/today-at-apple-in-person-classes-canceled/\">delay the return</a> to in-person Today at Apple sessions. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn replacement of in-person sessions, Apple has been producing and publishing Today at Apple sessions for YouTube, ranging from photography to drawing and art. Apple customers in Europe can now reserve and participate in Today at Apple sessions by checking the website for date, time, and availability for their local store. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says that it will ask all participants, including kids, to wear a mask, adhere to social distancing, and additional health and safety measures based on local conditions. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/today-at-apple-sessions-in-person-europe/\">Apple Returns to In-Person 'Today at Apple' Sessions in Europe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-returns-to-in-person-today-at-apple-sessions-in-europe.2309405/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LNx0hRQeAkU:I3QtuYcOd5k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LNx0hRQeAkU:I3QtuYcOd5k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LNx0hRQeAkU\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f15e273aea75e6050355b847468e9133309f93d74e1b71100f62397e30260a7","category":"Apple"}
