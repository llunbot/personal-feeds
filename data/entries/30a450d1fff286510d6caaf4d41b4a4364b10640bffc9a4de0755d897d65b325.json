The Turbo weighs a claimed 260g in a 26mm size, with the Turbo RapidAir coming in at a claimed 230g in the same size.</p>\n<p>In terms of tread, the new Mondo appears to use a chevron pattern on the shoulders, before switching to an angular dash and a smooth central strip.</p>\n<h2>Gripton compound but no puncture protection</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Peter Sagan also used the Mondo in Sunday’s men’s race.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Back to the compound, and Gripton T2 prioritises low rolling resistance, according to Specialized, while T5 adds grip and durability, so is typically used on the shoulders of the tyre.</p>\n<p>The Mondo is 2Bliss Ready – that’s Specialized’s way of saying it can be used tubeless – but, unlike the S-Works Turbo, the Mondo’s sidewall makes no mention of a puncture protection belt.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Is this a new flagship road tyre from Specialized.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James York / Matt Grayson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>That’s all we know for now. Could this be a flagship tyre that forgoes additional puncture protection in favour of race-day speed? Or is this a new tyre designed specifically to be used in the wider sizes common at Paris-Roubaix?</p>\n<p>We’ll bring you more when we have it.</p>","author":"George Scott","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"30a450d1fff286510d6caaf4d41b4a4364b10640bffc9a4de0755d897d65b325","category":"Cycling"}
