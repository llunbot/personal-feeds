The\nregulators say employees used their personal devices to discuss\nofficial company business via apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, or\nSignal and that those “off-channel communications” weren’t\n“maintained or preserved.”</p>\n\n<p>Not keeping records of those conversations violates the 1934\nSecurities Exchange Act’s recordkeeping rules, as well as similar\nrules from the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, according to the\nSEC. The CFTC maintains its own recordkeeping requirements, which\nit says were violated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My first thought was, “I’ll bet they regret using encrypted messaging for this.”</p>\n\n<p>My second thought was, “But... depending on what they were discussing, maybe not?”</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes paying a fine — even a stiff one — is a win.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/10/banks-fined-e2ee\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5ffaaf2b05a7f460f457da4da19a25bba4696e2e74f09ca5f17cc701a1acbaf6","category":"Tech"}
