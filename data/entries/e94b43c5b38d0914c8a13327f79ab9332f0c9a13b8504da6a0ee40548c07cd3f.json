Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-30/apple-iphone-15-pro-features-usb-c-port-new-design-thinner-bezels-lkpemg29\">claims</a> Apple went so far as to test the color, but in the final analysis decided against the option because the designers didn't like it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Gurman claims the dark color option could still \"theoretically\" be on the table for this year's model, presumably thanks to the popularity of the current device. Apple  already offers its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a> and SE models in several case color options. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to rumors, the second-generation version of the ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ could also potentially be lighter than the first-generation model.
