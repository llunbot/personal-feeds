In Europe, however, the iPhone 12 remains a notable device, as a number of countries are following France's lead in looking into the device's electromagnetic profile. With a software update coming, it may go back on sale soon.</p>\n<p>What kicked off the unexpected concern about a nearly 3-year-old phone was France's National Frequency Agency (ANFR). On the same day as Apple's fall product announcements, the ANFR informed Apple that <a href=\"https://www.anfr.fr/liste-actualites/actualite/retrait-temporaire-du-marche-de-liphone-12-pour-non-conformite-de-ces-appareils-a-la-reglementation-europeenne\">the iPhone 12 exceeds European Union regulations for Specific Absorption Rate</a> (SAR), the rate at which a human body would absorb radiation from a device. A <a href=\"https://www-anfr-fr.translate.goog/liste-actualites/actualite/retrait-temporaire-du-marche-de-liphone-12-pour-non-conformite-de-ces-appareils-a-la-reglementation-europeenne?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp\">translated version of the ANFR report</a> has the agency calling on Apple to withdraw the iPhone 12, \"quickly remedy this malfunction,\" and if not, \"recall copies already sold.\"</p>\n<p>There are two measures of SAR for a device operating in the same frequency range as an iPhone, <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9509b04f-1df0-4221-bfa2-c7af77975556/language-en\">per EU standards</a>. The \"head and trunk\" value, taken to protect against \"acute exposure effects on central nervous tissues\" when a phone is against the head or in a pants pocket, must not exceed 2 Watts of power per kilogram of body tissue, averaged over six minutes. When the phone is held in the hand or in clothing or accessories, for a \"limbs\" value, it's 4 W/kg.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968361#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968361&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e02a34a916c852750396ddd61f81219f0c87ed8200dbee875ac9e549759a8773","category":"Tech"}
