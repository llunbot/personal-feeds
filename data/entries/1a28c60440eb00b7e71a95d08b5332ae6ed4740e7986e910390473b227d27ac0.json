The change with the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models means that the device should get slightly taller, rather than wider. While the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models have been widely rumored to feature larger display for some time, the aspect ratio of the devices was unclear until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung also provided exact display sizes for the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max. The devices are expected to increase from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/\">iPhone 16 Pro to Feature Taller Aspect Ratio, iPhone 17 to Follow in 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio-iphone-17-to-follow-in-2025.2390880/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1a28c60440eb00b7e71a95d08b5332ae6ed4740e7986e910390473b227d27ac0","category":"Apple"}
