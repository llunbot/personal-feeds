It seems hard to believe that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=rapha\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha</a> has been around for two decades – we’ve only been reporting on bike tech &amp; rumors <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">since 2008</a>. But two decades ago, Rapha’s original merino blend Sportwool jersey set a new benchmark for rethinking road riding apparel. Their simple design aesthetic, forward-thinking technical designs, and focus on the little details, set off a renaissance of smarter high-performance cycling kit. And we all still benefit today from the spark of competition they ignited in the early 2000s…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rapha’s 20 years of “Performance, Progress &amp; Panache”</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-2004-Kings-of-Pain-exhibition-in-London-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-2004-Kings-of-Pain-exhibition-in-London-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Past Forward 20th anniversary, original Kings of Pain exhibition at the Truman Brewery in 2004\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-2004-Kings-of-Pain-exhibition-in-London-jpg.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-2004-Kings-of-Pain-exhibition-in-London-297x123.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-2004-Kings-of-Pain-exhibition-in-London-120x50.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-2004-Kings-of-Pain-exhibition-in-London-768x318.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos/Rapha)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was 20 years ago during the 3 weeks of the Tour de France that Rapha debuted at the Truman Brewery with their <em>Kings of Pain</em> exhibit, focusing on some of cycling’s greatest champions and their willingness to suffer for the beauty of the sport. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-Rapha-Sportwool-cycling-jersey-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-Rapha-Sportwool-cycling-jersey-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Past Forward 20th anniversary, original 2004 Rapha Sportwool cycling jersey\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-Rapha-Sportwool-cycling-jersey-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-Rapha-Sportwool-cycling-jersey-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-Rapha-Sportwool-cycling-jersey-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-Rapha-Sportwool-cycling-jersey-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary_original-Rapha-Sportwool-cycling-jersey-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That set the stage for their simple monochromatic black Rapha Sportwool cycling jersey with their trademark subtle pink details. And of course, the brand’s “<em>ex duris gloria</em>” motto… <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20041016194342/http://www.rapha.cc/features/feature_glory.php\" target=\"_blank\">glory through suffering</a></em>. It was a huge shift from – an<em>d a direct reaction to – the overly bright euro-style</em> plastic-feeling road cycling jerseys of the time, plastered with team sponsor logos. Rapha proposed a better way forward, a simpler cycling kit inspired by history, but remade in a modern way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rapha 20: Past Forward exhibition at the Truman Brewery in London, England</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery_London-Design-Week-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery_London-Design-Week-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Past Forward 20th anniversary exhibition at the Truman Brewery in London Design Week\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery_London-Design-Week-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery_London-Design-Week-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery_London-Design-Week-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery_London-Design-Week-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery_London-Design-Week-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of this year’s London Design Festival from September 14-22, Rapha will again take over the Truman Brewery for a “<em>kinetic installation, housed in an ethereal world of archive product and imagery</em>” paired with a stacked program of cycling industry panel discussions talks, parties, and group rides. It’s a celebration of twenty years of cutting-edge designs. And a look back at the transformative ethos behind the company that has since expanded from recreational road riders to the highest level of professional cycling. And then expanded to take in gravel cycling and mountain biking too.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Rapha’s progressive aesthetic, inspired by mid-century road cycling, futurism, fashion, and modernist typography, disrupted the status quo and forever changed the cycling industry. Since then, this rebellious approach has seen Rapha worn by Tour de France winners and receive accolades from around the world. Today, the brand has transcended the cycling industry to become a global movement.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So on September 14, 2024, Rapha 20 returns to the Truman Brewery to open <em>Past Forward</em>. It’s meant to be an exhibit that celebrates their designs and products of the past two decades. But also to set the stage for their next developments. Plus, Rapha say they will “<em>explore how cycling will continue to change lives, transform cities and be a radical force for social and environmental progress</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery-in-London_pink-architecture-logo-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery-in-London_pink-architecture-logo-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Past Forward 20th anniversary exhibition at the Truman Brewery in London Design Week\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery-in-London_pink-architecture-logo-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery-in-London_pink-architecture-logo-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery-in-London_pink-architecture-logo-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery-in-London_pink-architecture-logo-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Rapha-Past-Forward-20th-anniversary-exhibition_Truman-Brewery-in-London_pink-architecture-logo-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha’s full description of the exhibit:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em><strong>RAPHA20: PAST FORWARD EXHIBITION – G4, Ely’s Yard, The Truman Brewery, London E1 6QR</strong></em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rapha has commissioned creative duo Isabel + Helen to produce the centrepiece of the experience, Rapha in Motion; an installation inspired by the past and future of Rapha’s first merino-blend jersey. Visitors will discover a large-scale kinetic sculpture which brings to life the movement of cycling, and incorporates nods to the product innovation and craftsmanship that has driven the brand from the beginning.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rapha also enlisted top branding agency Made Thought to create the exhibition’s spatial and experiential design, and visual identity. As visitors enter the space, they will embark on an emotive, abstract journey through a selection of Rapha’s archive and definitive moments for the brand.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Completing the show is The Future of Cycling Manifesto, a printed publication that sets the stage for the next 20 years, and explores what the future of cycling could hold. Rapha has spoken to an alliance of contributors to produce a holistic take on how the sport and culture of cycling has changed over the past 20 years and how it could continue to grow, with contributors including Rapha’s founder Simon Mottram and new CEO Fran Millar, EF pro cyclists Lachlan Morton and Alison Jackson, AMANI’s Tsgabu Grmay and Transport to London’s Will Norman. All visitors will be able to take a copy of the manifesto away with them to read in full.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Register in advance </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://rpha.cc/past-forward-exhibition\" target=\"_blank\">‘Past Forward’ exhibit</a> is free with online registration (<a href=\"https://rpha.cc/past-forward-exhibition\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a>), from next week in London on September 14.
