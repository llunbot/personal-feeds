Windows RT failed, partly because a version of Windows that couldn't run Windows apps and didn't use a familiar Windows interface was ignoring two big reasons why people keep using Windows.</p>\n<p>Windows-on-Arm came back in the late 2010s, with better performance and a translation layer for 32-bit Intel apps in tow. This version of Windows, confined mostly to oddball Surface hardware and a handful of barely promoted models from the big PC OEMs, has quietly percolated for years. It has improved slowly and gradually, as have the Qualcomm processors that have powered these devices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032066#p3\">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032066&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"28e49e5288b2e205ec3f785455458e37e393f06e34a3dc5d5b2c7da268774a83","category":"Tech"}
