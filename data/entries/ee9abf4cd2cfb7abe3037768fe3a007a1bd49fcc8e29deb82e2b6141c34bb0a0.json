In the case of the Plus model, this is likely because it is just $100 less than the Pro, so most customers simply opt for the higher-end model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere has been uncertainty in recent months about the intention of the so-called ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Slim\" and its rumored position in the lineup. Last week, YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8c7HWZRO_D8?feature=shared\">first to suggest</a> that the device could be positioned as an \"‌iPhone‌ Air.\" Now, Gurman seems to have supported this idea.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Air\" will represent a new approach to this fourth model in the lineup, offering a device with a substantially thinner design that sits between the ‌iPhone 17‌ and ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro. Gurman compared the device to the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> from 2008, which sat between the regular MacBook and MacBook Pro in the lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>The sales pitch will probably go like this: If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone — but don't really need the performance, screen size or cameras of a Pro model — you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt minimum, Gurman expects the ‌iPhone‌ \"Air\" to be more popular than the ‌iPhone‌ mini and Plus devices from recent years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman added that the thinner design of the ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Air\" will \"just be a step toward something better\" since Apple will eventually want to \"squeeze the power of a Pro model into this smaller design.\" However, he does not expect this to occur before 2027 at the earliest.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/\">Next Year's Slim iPhone 17 Could Be an 'iPhone Air'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-years-slim-iphone-17-could-be-an-iphone-air.2433457/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee9abf4cd2cfb7abe3037768fe3a007a1bd49fcc8e29deb82e2b6141c34bb0a0","category":"Apple"}
