Those cyclists include Johnny Gaudreau who played in the NHL for the Columbus Bluejackets, and his brother, Matthew Gaudreau. Making the tragedy even more painful is the fact that the brothers were in New Jersey for their Sister’s wedding the following day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the reports, 43 year-old Sean M. Higgins of Woodstown, New Jersey was traveling North when he tried to pass a slower-moving sedan and SUV by pulling into the Southbound lane. Higgins passed the sedan, but then the SUV moved out into the Southbound lane as well to give the cyclists room while passing. That’s when Higgins, who police suspect was under the influence of alcohol at the time, decided to try to pass the SUV on the right, plowing directly into the brothers riding from behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is this not an accident as suggested by many headlines this morning (including the <a href=\"https://www.dispatch.com/story/sports/nhl/columbus-blue-jackets/2024/08/30/columbus-blue-jackets-johnny-gaudreau-dead-bike-accident-crashnew-jersey-calgary-flamesnhl/75009208007/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbus Dispatch</a> which has now changed its headline), but it seems the Gaudreau brothers’ deaths were the result of alcohol-fueled road rage, if not worse. According to the police affidavit, as reported by <a href=\"https://6abc.com/post/columbus-blue-jackets-confirm-death-johnny-gaudreau-brother-matthew/15247138/\" target=\"_blank\">6 ABC out of Philadelphia</a>, Higgins admitted to having “five to six” beers before the crash and told investigators he thought the SUV was trying to stop him from passing. Higgins also failed a field sobriety test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higgins has been charged with two counts of death by auto and is currently being held at Salem County Correctional Facility, but if it’s like any other cyclist’s death by auto, he’ll probably get off with a slap on the wrist.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div><blockquote><p>Columbus Blue Jackets statement on the passing of Johnny Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew. <a href=\"https://t.co/V2aFykgKIs\">pic.twitter.com/V2aFykgKIs</a></p>— Columbus Blue Jackets (@BlueJacketsNHL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlueJacketsNHL/status/1829481858968535120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our thoughts go out to the Gaudreau family, and all those before Johnny and Matthew whose lives have been cut short by inattentive, impatient, or outright impaired motorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From the NHL:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NEW YORK (August 30, 2024</strong>) – National Hockey League Commissioner <strong>Gary Bettman</strong> released the following statement on the passing of <strong>Johnny Gaudreau</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The National Hockey League family is shocked and saddened by the tragic passing of Columbus Blue Jackets forward <strong>Johnny Gaudreau</strong> and his brother <strong>Matthew</strong>. While Johnny’s infectious spirit for the game and show-stopping skills on the ice earned him the nickname ‘Johnny Hockey,’ he was more than just a dazzling hockey player; he was a doting father and beloved husband, son, brother and teammate who endeared himself to every person fortunate enough to have crossed his path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Gaudreau often told the story of how his father taught him to skate as a child in his home state of New Jersey and he carried that same youthful passion throughout his 11 NHL seasons. A skilled playmaker, Gaudreau participated in the NHL All-Star Game seven times where he was always a fan favorite, particularly while showcasing his talents in the various skills competitions for which he was so well suited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He will be remembered fondly in Calgary, where he played his first nine seasons with the Flames from 2013-14 to 2021-22, emerging as one of our League’s brightest young stars while compiling the franchise’s fifth-highest career points total. His loss also will be felt profoundly in Columbus, the city in which he chose to settle his family and where he was one of the respected, veteran leaders of a club building toward the playoffs. And both Johnny and Matthew will be mourned at Boston College, where they were teammates the year Johnny won the Hobey Baker Award in 2013-14, and at Gloucester Catholic High School in New Jersey, where both played and where Matthew was the head hockey coach following his own five-year pro playing career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We send our most heart-felt condolences to his wife Meredith; their children, Noa and Johnny; his parents, Guy and Jane; and sisters Kristen and Katie. And we grieve alongside his teammates, members of the Blue Jackets and Flames organizations, his many friends in hockey and countless fans around the world for whom he created indelible memories on and off the ice.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nhl-player-johnny-gaudreau-brother-matthew-killed-while-riding-by-suspected-drunk-driver/\">NHL Player Johnny Gaudreau, Brother Matthew Killed While Riding By Suspected Drunk Driver</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Staff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"79fb8321118f3e6d154552c239569ca716b538e5b5edbc977979e3c67f34f55b","category":"Cycling"}
