We don't always get this right—it's easy to get confused about what someone else might be thinking—but we still rely on it for everything from navigating complicated social situations to avoiding bumping into people on the street.</p>\n<p>There's some mixed evidence that other animals have a limited theory of mind, but there are alternate interpretations for most of it. So two researchers at Johns Hopkins, Luke Townrow and Christopher Krupenye, came up with a way of testing whether some of our closest living relatives, the bonobos, could infer the state of mind of a human they were cooperating with. The work clearly showed that the bonobos could tell when their human partner was ignorant.</p>\n<h2>Now you see it...</h2>\n<p>The experimental approach is quite simple and involves a setup familiar to street hustlers: a set of three cups, with a treat placed under one of them. Except in this case, there's no sleight-of-hand in that the chimp can watch as one experimenter places the treat under a cup, and all of the cups remain stationary throughout the experiment.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/bonobos-know-when-youre-clueless/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/bonobos-know-when-youre-clueless/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aa8248ac7ddac9cb1fd885940c773be2066da869eff869741b1813a3c955487f","category":"Tech"}
