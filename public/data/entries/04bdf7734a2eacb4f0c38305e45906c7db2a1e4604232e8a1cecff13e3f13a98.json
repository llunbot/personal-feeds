The refresh rate of the display adapts to what's happening on-screen, with lower rates used for static content and higher rates reserved for motion like games and video for a smoother, more responsive experience. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to an industry source cited by news aggregator account <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223037718015&amp;navType=by\">\"yeux1122\" on the Korean Naver blog</a>, just like last year, only the Pro models in the ‌iPhone 15‌ series will be equipped with the LPTO panels required for ProMotion, indicating that the feature will remain exclusive to Apple's higher-end models. From the machine-translated blog post:\r<br />\n<blockquote>Apple is said to have already made arrangements to deliver iPhone 15 series display panels to domestic companies, and will soon finalize details and prepare for mass production. What is confirmed here is that only the Pro Series will have a specification that supports LTPO 120 refresh rate, with the basic regular Plus model not having it in its requirements. </blockquote>\r<br />\nIf accurate, unfortunately this means that the always-on display option will also remain a Pro-exclusive feature, since it is the 1Hz refresh rate capability of the updated LPTO panels that enables an idle Lock Screen to stay visible without significantly impacting battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Naver blog's industry source corroborates the thinking of respected display analyst Ross Young, who in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/dynamic-island-all-iphone-15-models-rumor/\">September 2022</a> said that while he expects <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> to feature on all ‌iPhone 15‌ models, production scale constraints will <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1571494237153406976?s=20\">prohibit</a> Apple from bringing LPTO panels to the entire ‌iPhone 15‌ series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple's China-based supplier BOE, which has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/04/kuo-iphone-15-displays-boe/\">won orders for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus</a>, will not have production capacity for mass shipments of LTPO displays for high-end iPhones until 2024 at the earliest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the plus side, all ‌iPhone 15‌ models will be equipped with a more power-efficient OLED display driver chip manufactured based on a 28nm process, compared to 40nm for current models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/22/iphone-15-more-power-efficient-oled-displays-rumor/\">according to one report</a>. The primary benefit of the 28nm chip would be reduced power consumption, which could contribute to longer battery life for ‌iPhone 15‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the latest rumors about the ‌iPhone 15‌ lineup, read our roundups linked below.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/promotion/\">ProMotion</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/iphone-15-no-promotion-always-on-display/\">Standard iPhone 15 Models to Lack ProMotion and Always-On Display Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/standard-iphone-15-models-to-lack-promotion-and-always-on-display-features.2382986/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"04bdf7734a2eacb4f0c38305e45906c7db2a1e4604232e8a1cecff13e3f13a98","category":"Apple"}
