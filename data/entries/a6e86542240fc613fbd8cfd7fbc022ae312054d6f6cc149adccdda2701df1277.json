{"title":"M2 vs. M3 vs. M4 MacBook Air Buyer's Guide: 25+ Differences Compared","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2-vs-m3-vs-m4-macbook-air/","date":1741199800000,"content":"Apple just <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-announces-new-macbook-air-with-m4-and-sky-blue-color-option/\">announced a new MacBook Air</a>, introducing its latest chip, an enhanced camera, and a striking new color option. Simultaneously, it discontinued the two previous generations. So how does the new model compare?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/macbook-air-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBefore the introduction of the latest model, the 13-inch M3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> started at $1,099 and the 15-inch model started at $1,299. The 13.6-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip from 2022 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m2-macbook-air-under-1000/\">remained in the lineup</a> at a price of $999. Now, the 13-inch M4 model starts at $999. It is also worth remembering that it is possible to shave at least $100 off the price of a new ‌MacBook Air‌ directly from Apple with education pricing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe main upgrade offered by the three ‌MacBook Air‌ models are their chips. In benchmark tests, the M3 outperforms the ‌‌M2‌‌ by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. In GPU performance measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‌‌M2‌‌. The M4 outperforms the M3 by about 25% in single-core tasks and 30% in multi-core tasks. In GPU performance, the M4 offers improvement of around 21% over the ‌M3‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a number of other notable differences between the three ‌MacBook Air‌ generations beyond their chips. While these upgrades are fairly small, they are worth bearing in mind when contemplating whether to get the latest model, or a used or refurbished unit for a lower price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRead on to find out about all of the differences between the ‌M2‌, M3, and M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ models to help you decide which model will suffice for you, as well as if it may be worth upgrading. \r<br />\n\r<br

MacBook Airs represent minor upgrades over their predecessors, largely focusing on enhanced performance rather than new capabilities. Their main target audiences are those who have an older ‌MacBook Air‌, such as an ‌M1‌ or Intel-based model, or no ‌MacBook Air‌ at all.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnless you can leverage the specific advantages of the M4 chip and require maximum performance from its highly portable form factor, it is likely not worth buying the M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ over the previous ‌MacBook Air‌ for most users, providing you can get it for a good enough price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, if future-proofing is a major priority because you tend to keep your computer for many years, the extra cash to get the latest model will probably be warranted. The M4 model's significantly improved camera and enhanced support for two external displays may also justifiably swing your buying decision if you make a lot of video calls or have multiple monitors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is certainly not worth upgrading from the ‌M2‌ or M3 to the M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ for the overwhelming majority of customers. Upgrading from an ‌M2‌ 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ to an M4 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ may be more justifiable owing to the display size increase, but there is little that the latest generation meaningfully offers over its predecessor. The two older machines are still highly capable.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/\">M4</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2-vs-m3-vs-m4-macbook-air/\">M2 vs. M3 vs. M4 MacBook Air Buyer's Guide: 25+ Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m2-vs-m3-vs-m4-macbook-air-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2452070/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a6e86542240fc613fbd8cfd7fbc022ae312054d6f6cc149adccdda2701df1277","category":"Apple"}
