Kuo's prediction mirrored an <a href=\"https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=20\">earlier rumor</a> from the same Weibo source, claiming that the existing Blue Titanium color will be dropped from the ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ lineup in favor of a new \"rose\" titanium color.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Kuo believes the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus will apparently be offered in black, green, pink, blue, and white. The iPhone 15 and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus are available in black, green, pink, blue, and yellow. This means that white will replace yellow, with the colors remaining the same.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/iphone-16-series-all-the-latest-rumors/\">iPhone 16 Series Is Just Two Months Away: Everything We Know</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nKuo mentioned that Apple might rename some of the existing colors, similar to how \"White\" on the iPhone 12 was changed to \"Starlight\" on the iPhone 13. Even if the color names remain the same, the actual tone and appearance might still differ. The ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is anticipated to be announced in the fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-16-pro-rose-color-coming/\">iPhone 16 Pro Again Rumored to Come in New 'Rose' Color</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-again-rumored-to-come-in-new-rose-color.2431477/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5aa93590b7a19a5d7df7d272b50b57f33e92e861e33bb4e39cc8eb2254ebd549","category":"Apple"}
