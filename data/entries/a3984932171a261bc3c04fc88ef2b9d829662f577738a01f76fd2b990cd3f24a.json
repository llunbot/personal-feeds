Currently only 128GB and 256GB versions are available, but more are likely to arrive soon. The iPhone 15 Plus is also expected to become available in the coming days, as are the discontinued iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, since these models are now listed in the sidebar of the regional refurb stores but are currently greyed out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll refurbished iPhones from Apple are unlocked and compatible with any carrier. Each refurbished iPhone is equipped with a new battery, a new outer shell, and a USB-C to USB-C cable, making them virtually indistinguishable from brand-new devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRefurbished iPhones also come with Apple's standard one-year warranty, and buyers have the option to extend coverage with AppleCare+.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max in September 2024, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-iphone-15-pro-iphone-13/\">discontinued</a> the iPhone 15 Pro and ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max. Apple continues to sell new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models on its main online storefront.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Felix!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/\">Europe</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-begins-selling-refurb-iphone-15-europe/\">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished iPhone 15 Lineup in Europe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-iphone-15-lineup-in-europe.2446879/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3984932171a261bc3c04fc88ef2b9d829662f577738a01f76fd2b990cd3f24a","category":"Apple"}
