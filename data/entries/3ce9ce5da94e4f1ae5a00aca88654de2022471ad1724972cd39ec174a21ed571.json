The connector was a significant change from the previous 30-pin connector used in Apple devices, offering a smaller, more efficient connection that could be inserted either way up, enhancing ease of use. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/lightning-connector-feature-blue.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn September 2023, over a decade later, Apple caught up with the rest of the industry and removed the Lightning port from its flagship <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> series, replacing it with USB-C, the widely adopted standard used in electronics for connectivity and charging. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnd yet the Lightning port lives on in a variety of hardware still sold by Apple. We've compiled this list of Lightning products in one place so you won't be surprised when your USB-C to USB-C cables don't fit your new purchase. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone SE (2022)</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/iPhone-SE-3.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nApple introduced the third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> in March 2022. The $429 ‌iPhone‌ comes with an A15 Bionic chip, 5G connectivity, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> for those who prefer a Home button. And a Lightning port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 13</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/Apple-iPhone-13-colors-lineup-2022.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1400\" />\r<br />\nIn 2021, Apple unveiled the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>‌ as the successor to the popular ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12, with improved rear cameras, longer battery life, the A15 Bionic chip, and more. It starts at $599, Lightning port included.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/iphone-14-purple-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> now sits in the middle of Apple's ‌iPhone‌ lineup below the ‌iPhone 15‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, but above the ‌iPhone SE‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌. The ‌iPhone 13‌ starts at $599, and is still highly capable for everyday use, if you love Lightning ports. The ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ and ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ Plus are priced at $699 and $799, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPad (9th generation)</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ipad-botw.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nA lower-priced alternative to the latest 10th-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, the ninth-generation ‌iPad‌ has remained on sale since September 2021 and goes for $329 - $120 less than its successor. This device sports the A13 Bionic chip and an older design with a smaller display, but the Lightning port is the same size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPods Max</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/airpods-max-flat.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nIntroduced in December 2020, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> have now been in Apple's product lineup for three years. Apple is expected to replace the Lightning port for USB-C to comply with European regulations and for consistency across its AirPods lineup, but not until late 2024. Staying retro until then, but in a high-tech way.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Pencil (1st generation)</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/11/ipadproapplepencil.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"581\" />\r<br />\nThere are three versions of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> that Apple still sells. This first version was released in 2015, the second version was released in 2018, and the third version was released in 2023. The first-generation has a Lightning adapter and charges by plugging into a lightning port on either an ‌iPad‌ or a charging adapter, the second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ charges wirelessly, but the latest ‌Apple Pencil‌ has a futuristic USB-C port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Magic Keyboard</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/mac-magic-keyboard.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe Magic Keyboard is sold in several variations by Apple, and all with a Lightning port for charging and connectivity. Even the newly announced M3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> is still accompanied by a Magic Keyboard with a Lightning port for pairing and charging, rather than USB-C as rumored.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Magic Mouse</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/magic-mouse-2-lightning.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" />\r<br />\nThe only mouse that insists on doing a backflip to recharge. It's almost a joke, but the $99 Magic Mouse still retains the clownish Lightning port on the underside. It's pretty amazing Apple still has this thing around, and is even prepared to ship new iMacs with one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Magic Trackpad</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/magic-trackpad-colors.jpg\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1348\" />\r<br />\nSurprisingly, a Magic Trackpad with USB-C is still a fantasy. Technically, you could always buy a MacBook, but that works out pricier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Cables and Adapters</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Lightning-to-USB-3-Camera-Adapter.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple also sells a variety of cables and adapters that feature Lightning connections and ports, so keep an eye out if you're shopping Apple's accessories for your legacy devices.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/\">Lightning</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/hardware-apple-still-sells-lightning-port/\">All the Hardware Apple Still Sells With a Lightning Port</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-the-hardware-apple-still-sells-with-a-lightning-port.2410854/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3ce9ce5da94e4f1ae5a00aca88654de2022471ad1724972cd39ec174a21ed571","category":"Apple"}
