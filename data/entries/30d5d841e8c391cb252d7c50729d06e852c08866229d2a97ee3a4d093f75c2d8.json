It uses motors and algorithms on three axes (tilt, pan, roll) to correct unwanted movements. Gimbals are used in professional video production and by iPhone filmmakers to stabilize shots and enable creative camera movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For iPhone film-makers who are also vloggers, however, a gimbal must be able to do even more. And so Insta360 has packed features into the revised Flow 2 Pro ideal for the iPhone, offering versatile tracking via Apple DockKit in over 200 iOS apps, including apps for streaming and video conferencing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flow 2 Pro offers everything mobile filmmakers need: an integrated selfie stick, an extendable tripod, and a practical selfie mirror. The Insta360 app also includes exciting features such as 360-degree panorama, dolly zoom, motion timelapse, time shift, and even a teleprompter for vlogging. The Flow 2 Pro follows every movement in 360 degrees and can be operated remotely using gesture control, Apple Watch or even a second iPhone. And best of all: when folded up, it fits easily into a jacket or trouser pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When folded, the dimensions are still compact at 97.9 by 178.4 by 36.7 millimeters. When unfolded, the dimensions are 121.1 by 282.1 by 54 mm. The weight is low at 357 grams. The built-in battery has a capacity of 1,100 mAh, which should be enough for a maximum runtime of ten hours. This almost worked for us in the test. With a charging time of just two hours, it is also recharged relatively quickly. Thanks to the USB-C connection, the gimbal’s built-in battery can be used as a power bank for the iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 01\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 02\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 05\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 14\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_14.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 17\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_17.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 21\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_21.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 07\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 12\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lots of fun in practice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pack up and go–an exercise that the Flow 2 Pro masters well. It takes a bit of trial and error to get it to lock into position and switch off straight away. But then it is a compact package that takes up roughly the same space as the iPhone Pro Max. The Flow 2 Pro comes with a fabric bag for transport, which also holds accessories such as the iPhone holder and the LED light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flow 2 Pro is quickly ready for use and fascinates with its range of functions. The Flow 2 Pro can also be controlled sensitively with the joystick. Rotating the iPhone from portrait to landscape format is easily achieved with the thumb, as is switching between the front and rear camera. The infinitely variable zoom using the rotating ring through all iPhone lenses offers great creative freedom and enables smooth transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It compensates for walking and climbing stairs very smoothly, as well as panning. The AI functions are the icing on the cake. First and foremost, the tracking: press the front button and the Flow 2 Pro automatically recognizes faces in many apps that use the camera.  Further tracking is not limited to faces, which are recognized automatically, but the selection is made simply by dragging a selection frame. This even works if the object is briefly obscured. This makes the 360-degree photo function seem almost boring, even though it works perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One AI function should not be forgotten: remote control via gestures, as known from action cams, or control via the app on the Apple Watch. Although the image on the Apple Watch is somewhat delayed, it still works well.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360 Flow 2 Pro Accessories\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360-Flow-2-Pro_Accessories.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360 Flow 2 Pro Backpack Mount\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360-Flow-2-Pro_Backpack-Mount.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 25\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_25.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Spotlight 2 Kopie\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Spotlight-2-Kopie.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Insta360Flow2Pro 20\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insta360Flow2Pro_20.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What is always fiddly is pulling out the selfie stick and the tripod legs. The Flow 2 Pro also feels much better in the hand than its predecessor, the Flow Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessories include a short USB-C charging cable for the iPhone, a magnetic smartphone holder, the Spotlight LED light, a backpack holder and a sturdy carrying case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Insta360 Flow 2 Pro?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The gimbal does its job impressively well and provides excellent stabilization even when walking, climbing stairs, or panning the camera. However, the real highlight is the tracking functions. Thanks to Apple DockKit, the Flow 2 Pro enables precise automatic tracking, while objects can also be marked manually. Even if interfering objects get into the picture, the tracked subject remains in focus. This makes the gimbal perfect not only for vlogging, but also for sports and action videos, or even video conferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A product is only really complete when the details are convincing. And this is exactly where the Flow 2 Pro shines in the truest sense of the word with its selfie mirror and intuitive, one-handed controls. Well thought-out extras such as the USB-C ports for powering the iPhone and the optional additional light make the gimbal even more versatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support of other apps thanks to Apple DockKit is no small matter. For example, the professional camera app Blackmagic Cam from Blackmagic can be used seamlessly with the Flow 2 Pro–a real plus for discerning filmmakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"30d5d841e8c391cb252d7c50729d06e852c08866229d2a97ee3a4d093f75c2d8","category":"Apple"}
