{"title":"Take $100 off the A17 Pro iPad mini in this best-ever discount","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575617/the-a17-pro-ipad-mini-sheds-100-off-its-price-for-the-first-time.html","date":1736872728000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest iPad mini is starting the year down to an absolutely amazing price—the best we’ve ever seen in fact. For the very first time, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">A17 Mini is down to $399</a>, a massive $100 under its MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a tablet that got a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2504744/ipad-mini-a17-pro-review.html\">4-star rating from us</a>, with our review appreciating the new fast CPU and the graphics it delivers, as well as the fact that it supports Apple Intelligence and all the goodies that come with it. In fact, that’s the main upgrade we’re seeing in this new iPad mini over previous versions. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> is, of course, the primary benefit of getting this new chip, vastly improving Siri, using it to write content and texts, fiddling with images, and so on as it rolls out throughout 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tablet’s 8.3-inch Liquid Retina Display is as gorgeous as always, delivering vibrant colors and sharp details, which is great for reading, writing, streaming content, and so on.  We also loved that this new model has a baseline storage of 128GB, but if you need more, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3XM94S/\">256GB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3XT3DX/\">512GB</a> options are also $100 off. If you want to use an Apple Pencil with this tablet, you can do so because it works with both the new Apple Pencil Pro (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J71RM7\">on sale for $99</a>) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL7J12YK/\">USB-C Apple Pencil</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you want to use the new iPad mini A17 for, now’s the absolute best time to add it to your cart because such impressive discounts are hard to come by for Apple gear. Go ahead and splurge on yourself and get this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">$399 iPad</a> delivered ASAP.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"02dde7dd95acba3673fb55495129ed1dbbbb7d401da9e7440ba0628775c42d1c","category":"Apple"}
