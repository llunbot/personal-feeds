But the most impressive feature is magnetic MagSafe wireless charging support (iPhone 12 and later) thanks to a removable 5,000mAh battery pack. There are smaller and higher-capacity alternatives, but the Matrix Ultimate is one of the few that charges three Apple devices while delivering a full 15W to an iPhone.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-above.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Alogic Matrix Ultimate-3-in-1 power bank charger above\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-above.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-above.jpg?resize=300%2C296&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-above.jpg?resize=768%2C758&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1010\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Modular three-piece design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alogic has a range of modular MagSafe charging products in its Matrix range. Each can be connected to others, with detachable portability being one of the benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Matrix Ultimate could be used on a desk or bedside table charging stand, and is attractive enough to sit anywhere in the house or office. It comes into its own, however, as a portable solution. As a stand, it raises the magnetically clamped iPhone, which can be set in either portrait or landscape orientations—perfect for iOS 17’s StandBy mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are away from your desk the Matrix Ultimate has a 5000mAh battery to fill up your devices without power. It’s a good size—there are bigger magnetic power banks out there, but they’re bulkier and heavier, and we’re yet to see one that charges at MagSafe’s full 15W potential (though <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html\">Qi2</a> could change that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stand measures 5.8 x 3.1 x 1.9 inches (14.8 x 8 x 4.7 cm) and weighs 16.9oz (478g) with the power bank. Detached, the power bank is 3.7 x 2.5 x 0.9 inches (9.4 x 6.4 x 2.2 cm) and weighs 5.3oz (151g), which is about average for a battery pack of this size. At the back of the stand is a flip-up Apple Watch charging module that can rest at 90 degrees. The Watch hangs straight, unlike on some stands (I’m looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2216927/oneadaptr-onego-review-3-in-1-charger-and-magsafe-power-bank.html\">OneGo</a>) where the Watch can veer to one side.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-power-bank-Watch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Alogic Matrix Ultimate power bank with Apple Watch charger\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-power-bank-Watch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-power-bank-Watch.jpg?resize=300%2C228&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-power-bank-Watch.jpg?resize=768%2C582&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"777\" /><figcaption>The Matrix Ultimate power bank can connect with the detachable Apple Watch charger for wearable re-power on the go.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other MagSafe power banks also include a built-in flip-out Watch charger, but Alogic’s choice to give you the option of taking just the power bank or both could be convenient, although you’d need to be careful not to misplace the Watch charger when apart from either stand or power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5W Qi pad for AirPods is at the back of the stand and operable only when the base is unfolded to a stand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole stand is foldable. It’s pretty bulky, weighing about a pound (420 grams) fully laden, but transportable enough to warrant the term portable—especially in its travel case that also holds the 35W wall charger and cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alogic Ultimate Matrix: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Where most travel chargers are limited to 7.5 watts, the Matrix Ultimate is MagSafe compliant and supports up to 15W for iPhone 12 and later. The 3W Apple Watch charger is just enough for faster-than-normal charging (Series 7, 8, 9, and Ultra), and the 5W Qi pad at the back of the stand will charge up your AirPods’ charging case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closest rival for Watch and iPhone is the MagSafe-certified 15W <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/magsafe-portable-charger-2-in-1-power-bank-with-magsafe-white/77-89452.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2219687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">OtterBox 2-in-1 Power Bank with MagSafe ($149.95 / £139.95)</a>, which measures a similar 6 x 3.2 x 1.3 inches (15.3 x 8 x 3.4 cm) and weighs 12oz (340g). The OtterBox’s Apple Watch charger is faster than the Alogic Matrix Ultimate (5W vs 3W) but its stand lacks an AirPods charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole OtterBox unit is the power bank and is not detachable, so, on the move, the Matrix Ultimate is much more nimble, smaller, and significantly lighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We test power banks by running down an iPhone (for this case an iPhone 15 Pro) to 10 percent and then using the power bank to charge back up to 100 percent. This process is then repeated until the power bank is depleted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alogic Matrix Ultimate’s power bank scored 71 percent in our tests (less than one full charge), which is disappointing but not unreasonable for a 5,000mAh power bank. By comparison, the OtterBox’s 10,000mAh battery scored 185 percent and could recharge an iPhone 15 Pro nearly two times.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-vs-OneGo-power-bank-stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Alogic Matrix Ultimate vs OneAdaptr OneGo power banks\" width=\"1200\" height=\"721\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-vs-OneGo-power-bank-stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-vs-OneGo-power-bank-stand.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-vs-OneGo-power-bank-stand.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" /><figcaption>Right: Alogic Matrix Ultimate.

It managed to recharge our iPhone 1.5 times but requires a cable to charge your AirPods. If you desire a stand with a detachable power bank, the Lift offers twice the battery capacity but only the Ultimate will wirelessly fast-charge your iPhone, but the Matrix Ultimate takes the crown for its 15W wireless charging and clever design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read all our reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MagSafe magnetic wireless power banks</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Alogic Matrix Ultimate-3-in-1 power bank charger side\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-side.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-side.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alogic-Matrix-Ultimate-3-in-1-power-bank-charger-side.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><figcaption>The Watch hangs straight on the Matrix Ultimate.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alogic Matrix Ultimate isn’t cheap at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://alogic.co/products/matrix-ultimate-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-5-000mah-magsafe-power-bank&amp;xcust=1-1-2219687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$169.99</a> / <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://alogic.co.uk/products/matrix-ultimate-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-5-000mah-magsafe-power-bank&amp;xcust=1-1-2219687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">£129.99</a> / <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://ca.alogic.co/products/matrix-ultimate-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-5-000mah-magsafe-power-bank&amp;xcust=1-1-2219687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CA$189.99</a> / <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://au.alogic.co/products/matrix-ultimate-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-5000mah-magsafe-power-bank&amp;xcust=1-1-2219687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AU$269.95</a> / <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://eu.alogic.co/products/matrix-ultimate-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-5-000mah-magsafe-power-bank&amp;xcust=1-1-2219687-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">€159.99</a>. However, its price is similar to the OtterBox 2-in-1 charger, which suggests that Apple certification is one reason behind the higher costs.

It also gets points for its fast-ish 3W Apple Watch charger, which is detachable and can connect to the equally detachable 5K power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a giant wireless battery pack, you’ll need something else, but for most people, the Alogic Matrix Ultimate does the job well when you’re on the move and need to recharge as fast as possible away from a power socket. And when you get home (or a hotel), its stylish if slightly blocky design will dress up your desk or nightstand.</p>\n\nAccessories, Mobile Phone Accessories, Power</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"13b38b4fcc454fe3ff202b71332fed92cb083c8eb7ea18794a5cc597015974b2","category":"Apple"}
