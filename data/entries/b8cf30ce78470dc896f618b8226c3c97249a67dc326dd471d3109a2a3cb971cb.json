Today, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed the case in a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185.74.0_1.pdf\">one-page ruling</a>, ending a tumultuous chapter in the relationship between the Jeff Bezos-backed space launch startup and the federal government.</p>\n<p>The ruling was brief, simply granting the federal government’s motion to dismiss without going into detail. Judge Richard A. Hertling is giving Blue Origin and the government until November 18 to redact the full opinion before it’s released to the public.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810420#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810420&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b8cf30ce78470dc896f618b8226c3c97249a67dc326dd471d3109a2a3cb971cb","category":"Tech"}
