Instead of distributing the game through Google Play, Epic decided that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/fortnite-on-android-may-drive-its-battle-bus-past-googles-30-cut/\">sideloading</a> would be the way to get <em>Fortnite</em> on Android, thereby sidestepping Google's 30 percent cut of sales. Epic would go on to file <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/epic-vs-apple-google/\">an antitrust complaint</a> against Google, and newly unsealed court documents spotted by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612921/google-epic-antitrust-case-court-filings-unsealed\">The Verge</a> reveal an interesting solution that Google was kicking around at the time: the company was considering buying Epic.</p>\n<p></p><aside><h2>Epic vs. Apple/Google</h2>\n\t<ul><li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/google-allegedly-considered-buying-epic-games-to-silence-antitrust-complaints/\">Google allegedly considered buying Epic Games to silence antitrust complaints</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/the-epic-v-apple-case-could-hinge-on-the-definition-of-the-marketplace/\">The <em>Epic v.

In 2018, investors were giving Epic Games a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/the-reason-epic-landed-a-15-billion-valuation-is-not-fortnite-success.html\">$15 billion</a> valuation, so Google would have needed a pretty hefty offer. Today, Epic's last round of funding put its worth at<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/fortnite-creator-epic-games-valuation-jumps-to-29-billion.html\"> $29 billion</a>.

In order to sideload an app on Android (like a third-party app store), users have to tap through several scary messages warning them that sideloading is dangerous. Less tech-savvy users might be turned away by the high friction install process. And once installed, third-party app stores still can't update apps in the background the way Google Play can.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785736#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785736&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7bf68f97c87ef5615bed8cef634137b314710b532260134fb3f2687cdb310f77","category":"Tech"}
