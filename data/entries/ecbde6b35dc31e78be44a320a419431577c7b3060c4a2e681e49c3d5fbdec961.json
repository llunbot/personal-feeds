But Microsoft Xbox Chief Phil Spencer now says separate concerns surrounding <em>Starfield</em>'s potential PlayStation exclusivity helped drive <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/microsoft-purchases-bethesda-softworks-in-industry-changing-acquisition/\">Microsoft's 2020 purchase of Bethesda Softworks parent ZeniMax</a>.</p>\n<p>In Friday testimony concerning <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/\">the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to block the Activision purchase</a>, Spencer noted how, in 2020, Sony made paid deals ensuring Bethesda titles <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>Ghostwire Tokyo</em> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/bethesdas-multiplatform-future-is-minecraft-a-good-sign-for-skyrim/\">would ship on PlayStation</a> months before an Xbox version was available. “So the discussion about <em>Starfield—</em>when we heard that <em>Starfield</em> was potentially also going to end up skipping Xbox, we can’t be in a position as a third-place console where we fall further behind on our content ownership, so we’ve had to secure content to remain viable in the business,\" Spencer said on the stand.</p>\n<p>Those concerns weren't entirely based on Sony's previous practice, either. Just after the Bethesda purchase was announced, former Kinda Funny Host Imran Khan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imranzomg/status/1308054774902714369\">reported</a> that \"Sony had been negotiating timed exclusivity on <em>Starfield</em> as recently as a few months ago.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949935#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949935&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ecbde6b35dc31e78be44a320a419431577c7b3060c4a2e681e49c3d5fbdec961","category":"Tech"}
