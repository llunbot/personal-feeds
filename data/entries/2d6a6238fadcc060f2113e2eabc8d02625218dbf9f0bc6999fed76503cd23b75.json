The temporary store will be located in the west side of the mall, on the main level, but we have not confirmed if it is open yet. It is unclear when the renovated store will be completed, or what it will look like. Apple's retail design varies from store to store, but one modern element often included in newer spaces is an Apple Pickup station for in-store pickup of online orders.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple opened its Roosevelt Field location in 2002, months after the original iPod launched, and the company now operates 23 stores across New York state.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOver in Virginia, Apple is leaving the Fair Oaks shopping mall in Fairfax County, but is not moving very far away. Apple's website invites customers in the area to visit its new location \"soon\" at 4221 Fairfax Corner East Avenue, in the Fairfax Corner shopping plaza that is just across the Interstate 66 from the Fair Oaks mall. Apple has not shared an exact date and time for the relocated store's grand opening.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple opened its Fair Oaks store in 2008, less than a year after the original iPhone launched. It is in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, and not too far from Apple's first-ever store at Tysons Corner Center, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/apple-tysons-corner-store-now-open/\">also moved as part of a revamp last year</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/apple-store-revamps-long-island-and-fairfax/\">Apple Opening Revamped Stores on Long Island and in Fairfax, Virginia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-opening-revamped-stores-on-long-island-and-in-fairfax-virginia.2441608/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2d6a6238fadcc060f2113e2eabc8d02625218dbf9f0bc6999fed76503cd23b75","category":"Apple"}
