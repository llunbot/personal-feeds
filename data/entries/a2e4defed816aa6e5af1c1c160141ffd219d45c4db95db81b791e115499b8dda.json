To replace an iPad at this point, I would either need one of them to break or for Apple to dramatically change what the high-end iPads are capable of.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009539#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009539&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a2e4defed816aa6e5af1c1c160141ffd219d45c4db95db81b791e115499b8dda","category":"Tech"}
