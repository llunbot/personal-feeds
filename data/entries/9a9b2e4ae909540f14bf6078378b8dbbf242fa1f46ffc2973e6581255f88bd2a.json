All four riders – Lasse Norman Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Frederik Madsen and Rasmus Pedersen – were using the tape.</p>\n<p>The UCI’s controversial ‘sock height rule’, introduced in October 2018 as part of Article 1.3.033, states: “Socks and overshoes used in competition may not rise above the height defined by half the distance between the middle of the lateral malleolus and the middle of the fibula head.”</p>\n<p><span>Looking at data from </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/nopinz-time-trial-kit/\"><span>NoPinz</span></a><span> (the brand that produces UCI-legal shoe covers, as well as UCI-illegal ones that extend all the way up the knee), the potential advantage of a knee-length shoe cover could be in the region of two watts over a UCI-legal aero sock – a significant advantage in an event that can be decided by milliseconds. </span></p>\n<p><span>Speaking to BikeRadar, aero expert </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/drxavierdisley/\"><span>Dr Xavier Disley</span></a><span> confirmed it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a saving in this region, by using tape to mimic the aero-enhancing effect of a knee-length sock.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> UCI Article 1.3.033 states sock height cannot extend more than halfway up a rider’s leg.</span></figcaption><span> <i>UCI</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Though such tape is not explicitly banned by the </span><a href=\"https://www.uci.org/docs/default-source/equipment/clarificationguideoftheucitechnicalregulation-2018-05-02-eng_english.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>UCI’s technical regulations</span></a><span> (riders can often be spotted wearing kinesiology tape, for example), Article 1.3.033 continues:</span><span> “Any non-essential element or device, of which the purpose is not exclusively that of clothing or protection, is forbidden.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Perhaps crucially, the rule says: “This shall also apply regarding any material or substance applied onto the skin or clothing and which is not itself an item of clothing.”</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Denmark was the quickest team in the men’s team pursuit qualifiers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p><span>If that’s the case, then why was the Danish team allowed to take to the start line with the tape in place?
