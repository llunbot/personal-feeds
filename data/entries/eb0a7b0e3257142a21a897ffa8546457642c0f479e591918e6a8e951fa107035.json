So far, both Belkin and Spigen have announced Vision Pro-related products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack-holder.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" />\r<br />\nBelkin worked with Apple to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRDR2ZM/A/belkin-battery-holder-for-apple-vision-pro\">design a Battery Holder</a> for the Vision Pro Battery Pack. Priced at $50, the Belkin Battery Holder for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> is the only non-Apple accessory that Apple is selling for Vision Pro at this time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro battery fits inside the Battery Holder, which can be worn with a cross-body strap or a cable clip that clips on to a belt or pants. Apple is selling the accessory as an add-on for those that do not have a pocket to put the battery in while wearing the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpigen has debuted <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-Klasden-Pouch-Designed-Vision%2Fdp%2FB0CNDX83NQ\">a Vision Pro pouch</a> that offers protection for the device when it's not in use. Priced at $90, Spigen's case is more than $100 cheaper than the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2F3LL/A/apple-vision-pro-travel-case\">$200 Vision Pro Travel Case</a> that Apple is selling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-spigen-case.jpg\" width=\"1836\" height=\"1033\" />\r<br />\nSpigen's case features a nylon exterior, leather carrying strap, and an EVA shell for protection. There's a padded interior that secures the Vision Pro in place, along with a secret <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTag</a> compartment for tracking the Vision Pro. It also appears to have space for the Vision Pro battery pack, cable, and ZEISS lens inserts. The case is set to deliver between February 21 and 23, so it won't be available right at launch day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/speck-vision-pro-accessories.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"984\" />\r<br />\nOther accessory makers like Speck <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/pages/apple-vision-pro\">have started teasing</a> Vision Pro products ranging from carrying cases to battery holders, so it shouldn't be long before we see a whole range of Vision Pro accessory options.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-accessories-spigen-belkin/\">Belkin and Spigen Debut Apple Vision Pro Accessories</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/belkin-and-spigen-debut-apple-vision-pro-accessories.2416841/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb0a7b0e3257142a21a897ffa8546457642c0f479e591918e6a8e951fa107035","category":"Apple"}
