Here’s a quick guide so you can find out if your iPhone is compatible with the most recent iterations of the iPhone operating system, and, if it isn’t, which version you can install on your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple gives iOS a major update each year, usually introducing new features and some stability upgrades to the previous version, plus numerous smaller updates in between. Although the company is better than most at keeping older models on the list of supported devices, hardware limitations can sometimes mean that an iPhone gets left behind. This doesn’t mean the device will stop working, but you won’t be able to access the newer features and capabilities that come with the updated software. If your iPhone can’t run one of Apple’s supported versions of iOS then it’s probably time to upgrade your iPhone.

Just go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; About</strong> and look for the <strong>iOS Version</strong> number.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"How to check which version of iOS you are using\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1800w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption>The number you’re looking for will be something like 16.0 or 15.3.1. Don’t worry about the bit in parentheses.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which versions of iOS can each iPhone run?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To show you which version of iOS your iPhone can run, we’ve broken down each generation so you know which version it originally shipped with (as that will be the earliest it can run) and the latest iteration it currently supports. We’ll also estimate its chances of being on the compatibility list for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> when it arrives this fall. We’ve not listed the smaller ‘point’ releases, as they change all the time, so take it as understood that any version of iOS that the iPhone is shown as supporting (such as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-features-compatibility-how-to-update.html\">iOS 16</a>) also means any smaller point updates too (such as iOS 16.4.1).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that Apple has stopped supporting a lot of the older versions of iOS now, meaning there are no new security patches for them. For example, Apple currently supports the last two generations of the iPhone operating system: iOS 16 or 15. Because iPhones that could run iOS 13 and iOS 14 can run iOS 15, those versions of iOS are considered obsolete by Apple and aren’t updated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If support ended at iOS 15 though that would leave a number of iPhones unsupported though, so Apple has been known to issue security updates for iOS 12–one arrived as recently as January 2023. This extended the list of supported handsets to include the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and the iPhone 5S, handsets that arrived in 2014. We don’t imagine that Apple will be issuing any further iOS 12 updates though. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 16</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 13, 13 mini, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 15</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE (3rd generation)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 15</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 14</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 13</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE (2nd generation)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 13</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone XR, XS, XS Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 12</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Probably</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone X</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 11</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Possibly</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 8, 8 Plus</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 11</li><li>Latest iOS version: 16</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: Possibly</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 7, 7 Plus</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 10</li><li>Latest iOS version: 15</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 6S, 6S Plus</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 9</li><li>Latest iOS version: 15</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE (1st generation)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 9</li><li>Latest iOS version: 15</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 6, 6 Plus</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 8</li><li>Latest iOS version: 12</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 5S</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 7</li><li>Latest iOS version: 12</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 5C </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 7</li><li>Latest iOS version: 10</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 5</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 6</li><li>Latest iOS version: 10</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 4s </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 5</li><li>Latest iOS version: 9</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 4</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 4</li><li>Latest iOS version: 7</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 3GS</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 3</li><li>Latest iOS version: 6</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 3G</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 2</li><li>Latest iOS version: 4</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original iOS version: 1</li><li>Latest iOS version: 3</li><li>Will it get iOS 17: No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your iPhone isn’t supported by iOS 17, 16 or 15 then you might want to consider upgrading to a newer device.
