Therefore, this should be a race for the Ardennes specialists, albeit on a route a couple of hundred kilometres away from the Belgian hills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel </a>will come back to try to retain his title. After winning the rainbow jersey in Glasgow’s George Square last year, Van der Poel is unlikely to keep the jersey with the stiff opposition of Tadej Pogačar and Remco Evenepoel on the startlist. With the ultimate rainbow-coloured prize on the line, the roll call at this year’s World Championships is packed with Grand Tour champions, Monument winners and real contenders for a medal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with all that in mind, who do the bookmakers peg as the favourites to win the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">2024 World Championships Road Race</a>? Here are some of the most hotly-tipped riders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Tadej Pogačar, Slovenia</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tadej pogacar world championships\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-1596718559-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Top of our list – and probably everyone’s list – is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>. The Slovenian has been dominating the 2024 cycling calendar. He’s claimed a Monument, two Grand Tours and a bunch of stage races and Classics. Everything points towards another Pogi show in Switzerland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course suits him well, but any course does. 2km in length and at a 6% gradient, the crucial climb on the route is the perfect springboard for Pogačar. He’s also got the appropriate kick on him to win it from a reduced sprint. Even last year, he defeated Mads Pedersen at the end of a long day of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think we’ve ever had a rider more worthy of winning the rainbow jersey than him. Don’t forget, if he does win it all, Pogačar would also seal the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-tour-double\" target=\"_blank\">Triple Crown after his Giro-Tour double</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

Evenepoel</a> will undoubtedly be one of the men to watch in Zürich. Bear in mind, this course is harder than the one he triumphed on two years ago. However, Evenepoel is a climber who is unlikely to be taking tight stock of elevation gain figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His team will support him well we would imagine. Tim Wellens and Tiesj Benoot are likely to play leading roles in this race. Wellens, in particular, could be a strong second card if things don’t quite go to plan for Evenepoel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remco’s exploits at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic Games</a> last month may serve as a cautionary tale for what’s to come. That said, it’s rare that someone can follow him when he’s on one of those days. However, we haven’t quite seen how Tadej Pogačar would react to the long-distance Remco effort. Maybe the Slovenian is the only person who can block Remco from taking another rainbow jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Marc Hirschi, Switzerland</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-970x647.webp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/177aba0b-ff88-4beb-a5df-1fba67c4042c.webp 1496w\" /><figcaption>Anthony Anex/Keystone</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, Marc Hirschi. The Swiss rider has had quite the career so far, and he’s only just turned 26.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hirschi is on an impressive streak at the moment. He has won the past five races that he has taken part in. Not even Pogačar has done that this season. Yes, some of the races are a little ‘Mickey Mouse’, but this streak includes wins at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-race-ranked-men\" target=\"_blank\">WorldTour Bretagne Classic and Klasikoa San Sebastian</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hirschi has been giving us glimpses of his old form this summer. He’s looking sprightly in the hills and his top-end kick seems to be back. Four years ago, he claimed a medal in the road race. Perhaps he can add another one to his collection this year before <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\" target=\"_blank\">he heads to Tudor Pro Cycling in the winter</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>3/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pello Bilbao, Spain</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T175542.040.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spain will be led by Basque rider Pello Bilbao. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bahrain-victorious\" target=\"_blank\">Bahrain Victorious </a>rider has been a little underwhelming over the past six months. A blunt Tour de France and an anonymous August have been turned around in the past week following two top ten placements in Québec and Montréal. At the latter, he claimed a podium place behind winner Pogačar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bilbao also held his own in Montréal to keep the gap steady between himself and Pogačar out in front. Given how similar that race is to this, I wouldn’t be too shocked if we see him on the final podium in Zurich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his strong climbing legs, willingness to attack and race-savvy mind in one-day races, Bilbao is a strong each-way bet for the podium. Don’t forget about his kick as well, he’s easily one of the better sprinters amongst the climbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>3/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Primož Roglič, Slovenia</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177-970x606.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177-970x606.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177-300x188.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177-768x480.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177-1536x960.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177-750x469.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177-1140x713.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/file-2024-09-20T173801.177.png 1920w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic / Cxcling</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A former Liège–Bastogne–Liège winner himself, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> will start as Slovenia’s second-best chance of scoring the rainbow bands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a> rider is coming straight from a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta victory </a>and he will have spent more time on the roads given that he raced the time-trial as well.

His recent results have really impressed me and he’ll have extra support from the home crowds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/peter-sagan-world-championships\">Flashback Friday: When Peter Sagan dominated the World Championships</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 114: Tadej Pogačar on the Tour, Vingegaard, hating being in yellow, and his work with PlumeStrong</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">Pro cycling transfers 2024/2025: Castrillo’s choices, Astana signings, Van Aert signs his life away and Chabbey leaves Canyon-SRAM</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">UCI Road World Championships 2024: Routes, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-world-championships-road-race-mens-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the men’s World Championships Road Race 2024?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8376804494121f17c6051c9d73f7e297e8ca4408d611d4d26345d2b68a7750ce","category":"Cycling"}
