The upcoming K-Edge 1x Race W Chain Catcher uses your seat tube’s bottle cage bolts to hold it to the frame, with lots of adjustments and two sizes to fit a wide variety of frames from lots of brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-3-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"k-edge chain catcher mounts to seat tube bottle cage bolts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-3.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The chain guide segment mounts to the carrier arm with a thicker central bolt that acts like a pivot point. Two other screws on either end let you adjust the angle to match your chainline.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-6.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1153\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-6-1536x1153.jpg\" alt=\"k-edge chain catcher mounts to seat tube bottle cage bolts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-6-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-6-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-6-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-6.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Long slots let you adjust the height, and two depths will accommodate different diameter seat tubes – longer for large diameter seat tubes, shorter for thinner tubes, with a slam amount of additional adjustment to fine tune. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-7.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-7-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"k-edge chain catcher mounts to seat tube bottle cage bolts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-7-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-7-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/k-edge-bottle-cage-mount-chain-catcher-7.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $149.99, available now. It ships with all hardware plus a small tube of Loc-tite. Use longer bottle cage bolts and you can still put a water bottle cage on top of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/K-edge-MTB-stem-mount-for-cycling-computers.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/K-edge-MTB-stem-mount-for-cycling-computers-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"slim mountain bike stem mounts for cycling computers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/K-edge-MTB-stem-mount-for-cycling-computers-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/K-edge-MTB-stem-mount-for-cycling-computers-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/K-edge-MTB-stem-mount-for-cycling-computers-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/K-edge-MTB-stem-mount-for-cycling-computers-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/K-edge-MTB-stem-mount-for-cycling-computers.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve also updated their MTB Stem Mounts with a sleeker design. The computer mounting disc gets more material machined away for a slimmer profile that adds a bit more clearance from your stem, too. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re also adding a twist-in action camera/light mount for folks who’d rather use that spot for something other than a computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://k-edge.com\" target=\"_blank\">K-Edge.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/k-edge-1x-race-chain-guide/\">New K-Edge 1x Race W Chain Guide uses Bottle Cage Mounts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b7c380003391332027cf67559cb7febecf77ce93e93c3a38b81202a264034e19","category":"Cycling"}
