In the last 10 years, scientists have heatedly debated whether these unusual patterns are due to sand termites or to an ecological version of a self-organizing Turing mechanism. Last year, a team of scientists made a strong case for what they deemed definitive evidence of the latter, thus ruling out sand termites, but was their declaration of victory may have been premature?</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143383192300029X?via%3Dihub\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics offers a four-point rebuttal of those 2022 findings, concluding that sand termites may be to blame after all. Meanwhile, the lead author of that 2022 study has offered a counter-rebuttal to the rebuttal; there is currently <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4507988\">a preprint paper</a> undergoing peer review at the same journal. “The to and fro between opposing camps has often been nothing less than vitriolic,” Michael Cramer, an ecophysiologist at the University of Cape Town who has studied fairy circles, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/science/fairy-circles-cause-water-termites.html\">told The New York Times</a> last year. That's partly because of how challenging it is to definitively prove causation for “a long-lived ecological pattern that cannot be replicated in the lab”—however strenuously one side or the other may claim to have proven their case.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/its-not-termites-new-study-gives-fresh-take-on-how-fairy-circles-form/\">we've reported</a> previously, the fairy circles can be as large as several feet in diameter. Dubbed \"footprints of the gods,\" it's often said they are the work of the Himba deity <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukuru\">Mukuru</a>, or an underground dragon whose poisonous breath kills anything growing inside those circles. Scientists have their own ideas. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955177#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2504ade0dadf0924ba2cd91208b9115560392748d2f2ec528ddccea8d1d53a71","category":"Tech"}
