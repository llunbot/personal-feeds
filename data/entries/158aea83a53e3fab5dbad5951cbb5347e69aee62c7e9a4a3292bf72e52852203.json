The service, available through partner Goldman Sachs, offers a 4.15 percent annual percentage yield (APY) and has no minimum balance or deposit requirements or fees.</p>\n<p>Apple first previewed the savings account a little over six months ago in October. As per today's announcement, Apple Card users who choose to open a savings account will see cash back earned from Apple Card purchases (up to 3 percent, depending on the merchant) automatically go into their savings account. If they don't like this, they can change where the cash back goes through the Apple Wallet app.</p>\n<p>Savings account holders will be able to manage things via a Savings dashboard in the Wallet. The dashboard will let users link another (non-Apple) banking account for fee-less transfers in both directions, as well as conduct transfers to and from an Apple Cash Card.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932318#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932318&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"158aea83a53e3fab5dbad5951cbb5347e69aee62c7e9a4a3292bf72e52852203","category":"Tech"}
