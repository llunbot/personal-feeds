Though just part of AMD's (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/amd-is-making-laptop-cpu-model-numbers-simultaneously-less-and-more-confusing/\">often-confusing</a>) Ryzen 7000 laptop lineup, the 7040U processors will be the ones to hold out for if you want to maximize performance without stepping up to a larger laptop with a dedicated GPU.</p>\n<p>AMD has delayed the announcement of these chips twice. AMD <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-delays-7040hs-phoenix-laptop-cpus-to-april\">announced in mid-March</a> that systems would begin shipping in April, and it's currently the beginning of May. One of the laptop makers offering a Ryzen 7040-series laptop, <a href=\"https://frame.work/blog/announcing-the-framework-laptop-13-powered-by-amd-ryzen\">Framework</a>, won't actually be shipping its preorders until sometime in Q3, though the larger PC companies will presumably be able to get things to market a bit sooner.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ryzen-perf-1-980x551.jpeg\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            AMD published a number of broad, flattering performance comparisons. Here, AMD compares itself to the i7-1360P, which isn't quite Intel's fastest CPU for these kinds of PCs.

The top-end Ryzen 7 7840U combines 8 CPU cores running at speeds of up to 5.1 GHz and a Radeon 780M GPU with 12 RDNA 3 cores. The Ryzen 5 7640U has 6 CPU cores running at up to 4.9 GHz and a Radeon 760M GPU with 8 cores. The Ryzen 5 7540U has the same 6 CPU cores but with a lower-end Radeon 740M GPU with 4 cores, while the Ryzen 3 7440U combines the same Radeon 740M GPU with 4 CPU cores.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936226#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936226&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04c24a2d6cf43d6061ced687c4fa5d4ad9e62622b0fc264cadade520faca55e5","category":"Tech"}
