In 1976, New York Times restaurant critic Mimi Sheraton accompanied the then-86-year-old Sanders to a KFC in midtown Manhattan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once in the kitchen, the colonel walked over to a vat full of\nfrying chicken pieces and announced, “That’s much too black. It\nshould be golden brown. You’re frying for 12 minutes — that’s\nsix minutes too long. What’s more, your frying fat should have\nbeen changed a week ago. That’s the worst fried chicken I’ve ever\nseen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you\nmake them?”</p>\n\n<p>When Mr. Singleton explained that he first mixed boiling water\ninto the instant powdered potatoes, the colonel interrupted. “And\nthen you have wallpaper paste,” he said. “Next suppose you add\nsome of this brown gravy stuff and then you have sludge.” “There’s\nno way anyone can get me to swallow those potatoes,” he said after\ntasting some. “And this cole slaw. This cole slaw! They just won’t\nlisten to me. It should he chopped, not shredded, and it should be\nmade with Miracle Whip. Anything else turns gray. And there should\nbe nothing in it but cabbage. No carrots!”</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Singleton replied, “I just do what I’m told, sir,” and Colonel\nSanders then said gently to the now stunned manager, “Well, it’s\nnot your fault. You’re just working for a company that doesn’t know\nwhat it’s doing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sanders was being paid $200,000 a year at the time to represent the chain in commercials. But what were they going to do — fire him? I wonder how many kids today realize Sanders was a real man who actually founded the chain, and not a fictional mascot, like Ronald McDonald, or the great pizza connoisseur Chuck E. Cheese?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5e7583fac8dda0ee98a2213eb050b014ff84998812da7398abd4c7ef55794076","category":"Tech"}
