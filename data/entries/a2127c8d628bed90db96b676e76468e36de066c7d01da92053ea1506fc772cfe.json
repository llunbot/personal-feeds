It probably wouldn’t be the new GT-1 from Selle Italia, but after you see how it’s put together, it all makes sense. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meant for commuter or comfort bikes, the GT-1 is an extremely affordable saddle that claims to have a smaller environmental footprint due to its unique construction. Instead of using glue to attach the padding to the saddle body, it uses what they are calling a Lock-on System. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Selle Italia GT1 saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate) material is definitely reminiscent of a Croc shoe, and the cover is created in a way that allows it to be mechanically interlocked to the saddle body. Theoretically, you should be able to replace the cover if it’s damaged, but you could also separate the cover from the body at the end of its life for recycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Selle Italia GT1 saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Selle-Italia-GT1-saddle4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring 180mm (W) x 250mm (L), the saddle includes Fec Alloy rails with a weight of 292g. The best part though, may be the retail of $39.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/selle-italia-gt-1-saddle-eva-foam/\">Selle Italia’s New GT-1 Saddle is Built Like a Croc with Glue-Free Lock-On System</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a2127c8d628bed90db96b676e76468e36de066c7d01da92053ea1506fc772cfe","category":"Cycling"}
