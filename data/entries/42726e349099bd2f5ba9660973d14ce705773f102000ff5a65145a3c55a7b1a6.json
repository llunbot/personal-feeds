Despite debuting on Europe's Top 10 smartphones list in its first full month of availability, the model failed to match the initial traction of its predecessors. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCounterpoint Research finds that the ‌iPhone 16e‌ was the ninth best-selling smartphone in Europe in March, representing 8% of Apple's total <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> sales in the region and 2% of the broader smartphone market. In Western Europe, the device performed slightly better, securing the seventh position overall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, the ‌iPhone 16e‌'s early performance marks a clear departure from the success of the ‌iPhone‌ SE models that preceded it. The third-generation ‌iPhone‌ SE from 2022 ranked sixth on the same European bestseller list during its first month and accounted for 12% of Apple's regional ‌iPhone‌ sales.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌iPhone‌ SE from 2020 performed even more strongly, achieving third place overall and making up 19% of Apple's European ‌iPhone‌ sales in its debut month. Compared to these benchmarks, ‌iPhone 16e‌ sales were down 17% versus the ‌iPhone‌ SE (2022) and down 20% compared to the ‌iPhone‌ SE (2020), according to Counterpoint.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, the primary reason identified for the ‌iPhone 16e‌'s weaker debut is its higher launch price. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ generally starts at €699 in Europe. This is a significant increase over the ‌iPhone‌ SE (2022), which debuted at €519, and the ‌iPhone‌ SE (2020), which launched at €479. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdditionally, the mid-tier smartphone market in Europe is increasingly price-sensitive; consumers are showing increased interest in refurbished and second-hand iPhones, which further complicates Apple's efforts to drive volume through new mid-range hardware. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/\">Counterpoint</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/\">Europe</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models/\">iPhone 16e Sales Lag Behind SE Models Despite Bestseller Status</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models-despite-bestseller-status.2458137/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"42726e349099bd2f5ba9660973d14ce705773f102000ff5a65145a3c55a7b1a6","category":"Apple"}
