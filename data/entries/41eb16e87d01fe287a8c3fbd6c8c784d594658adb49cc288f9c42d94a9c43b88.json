Musk has \nmarketed it as the world’s “town square,” but in number of users \nit continues to lag far behind social media rivals that focus on \nvideo, such as Instagram and TikTok. </p>\n\n<p>In February, X had 27 million daily active users of its mobile app \nin the U.S., down 18% from a year earlier, according to Sensor \nTower, a market intelligence firm based in San Francisco. The U.S. \nuser base has been flat or down every month since November 2022, \nthe first full month of Musk’s owning the app, and in total it’s \ndown 23% since then, Sensor Tower said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/whats_the_deal_with_sensor_tower\">I’m skeptical regarding Sensor Tower’s data</a>, but if they’re measuring all social network mobile app use the same way, it seems like a fair comparison against other social networks. And it jibes with my personal anecdata.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/25/twitter-bleeding-users\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"41eb16e87d01fe287a8c3fbd6c8c784d594658adb49cc288f9c42d94a9c43b88","category":"Tech"}
