Here are some launches that got my attention.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint</strong>. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/secure-connectivity-from-public-to-private-introducing-ec2-instance-connect-endpoint-june-13-2023/\">Endpoint for EC2 Instance Connect</a> allows you to securely access Amazon EC2 instances using their private IP addresses, making the use of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/linux-bastion/\">bastion hosts</a> obsolete. Endpoint for EC2 Instance Connect is by far my favorite launch from last week. With <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2//latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect.html\">EC2 Instance Connect</a>, you use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> policies and principals to control SSH access to your instances. This removes the need to share and manage SSH keys. We also updated the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a> to <a href=\"https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2-instance-connect/index.html\">allow you to easily connect or open a secured tunnel</a> to an instance using only its instance ID. I read and contributed to a couple of threads on social media where you pointed out that <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/\">AWS Systems Manager</a> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/session-manager.html\">Session Manager already offered similar capabilities</a>. You’re right. But the extra advantage of EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint is that it allows you to use your existing SSH-based tools and libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/scp\">scp</a> command.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Detective now supports code scanning of AWS Lambda functions.</strong> This expands the existing capability <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-inspector-code-scans-aws-lambda-function/\">to scan Lambda functions and associated layers for software vulnerabilities</a> in application package dependencies. <strong>Detective also extends finding groups to Amazon Inspector</strong>. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-detective-finding-groups-amazon-inspector/\">Detective automatically collects findings from Amazon Inspector</a>, GuardDuty, and other AWS security services, such as AWS Security Hub, to help increase situational awareness of related security events</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Verified Permissions is generally available</strong>. If you’re designing or developing business applications that need to enforce user-based permissions, you have a new option to centrally manage application permissions. Verified Permissions is a fine-grained permissions management and authorization service for your applications that can be used at any scale. Verified Permissions centralizes permissions in a policy store and helps developers use those permissions to authorize user actions within their applications. Similarly to the way an identity provider simplifies authentication, a policy store lets you manage authorization in a consistent and scalable way. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-how-you-manage-authorization-in-your-applications-with-amazon-verified-permissions-now-generally-available/\">Read Danilo’s post to discover the details</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Dual-Layer Server-Side Encryption</strong> with keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (DSSE-KMS). Some heavily regulated industries require double encryption to store some type of data at rest. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> offers DSSE-KMS, a new free encryption option that provides two layers of data encryption, using different keys and different implementation of the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) algorithm. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-how-you-manage-authorization-in-your-applications-with-amazon-verified-permissions-now-generally-available/\">My colleague Irshad’s post has all the details</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS CloudTrail Lake Dashboards</strong> provide out-of-the-box visibility and top insights from your audit and security data directly within the CloudTrail Lake console. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/announcing-aws-cloudtrail-lake-dashboards-visualize-and-analyze-cloudtrail-data/\">CloudTrail Lake features</a> a number of AWS curated dashboards so you can get started right away – with no required detailed dashboard setup or SQL experience.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS IAM Identity Center now supports automated user provisioning from Google Workspace</strong>. You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-iam-identity-center-automated-user-provisioning-google-workspace/\">connect your Google Workspace to AWS IAM Identity Center</a> (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) once and manage access to AWS accounts and applications centrally in IAM Identity Center.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS CloudShell is now available in 12 additional regions.</strong> AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that makes it easier to securely manage, explore, and interact with your AWS resources. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-cloudshell-additional-regions/\">The list of the 12 new Regions is detailed in the launch announcement</a>.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS News</strong></span><br /> Here are some other updates and news that you might have missed:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>AWS Extension for Stable Diffusion WebUI. </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui\">WebUI</a> is a popular open-source web interface that allows you to easily interact with Stable Diffusion generative AI. <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/stable-diffusion-aws-extension\">We built this extension</a> to help you to migrate existing workloads (such as inference, train, and ckpt merge) from your local or standalone servers to the AWS Cloud.</li> \n <li><strong>GoDaddy developed a multi-Region, event-driven system</strong>.
