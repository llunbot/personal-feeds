Apple says the M3 Ultra chip is up to 1.5x faster than the M2 Ultra chip, and up to 1.8x faster than the M1 Ultra chip. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, the M3 Ultra chip can be configured with up to an 80-core GPU. Apple says the M3 Ultra chip offers up to 2x faster graphics performance than the M2 Ultra, and up to 2.6x faster graphics than the M1 Ultra chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe chip has a 32-core Neural Engine, and it supports up to 512GB of unified RAM, with up to 819 GB/s memory bandwidth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, the M3 Ultra chip supports Thunderbolt 5 for up to 120 GB/s data transfer speeds on Macs with Thunderbolt 5 ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the M3 Ultra chip has industry-leading power efficiency in its class.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-ultra/\">M3 Ultra</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/\">Apple Introduces M3 Ultra Chip With Impressive Performance, Up to 512GB of RAM, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip-with-impressive-performance-up-to-512gb-of-ram-and-more.2452020/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"29aa4e07864481e1974bac518150a5ec578669f4986a6d1ae9e32de23e4b44d0","category":"Apple"}
