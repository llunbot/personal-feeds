After the announcement last week that YouTube Premium had hit 100 million subscribers, the company now says YouTube TV, its cable subscription plan, has <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/\">8 million subscribers</a>.</p>\n<p>Eight million subscribers might sound paltry compared to the 100 million people on Premium, but Premium is only $12.

Let's also not forget NFL Sunday Ticket, which this year became a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/googles-350-nfl-sunday-ticket-package-is-more-expensive-than-directv/\">YouTube TV exclusive</a>, as a $350-a-year add-on to the $73-a-month service (there's also a $ 450-a-year standalone package).</p>\n<p>The subscriber numbers come from a \"<a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/\">Letter from the YouTube CEO</a>\" blog post for 2024 from YouTube CEO Neal Mohan. With YouTube basically unable to get any bigger as the Internet's defacto video host, Mohan says the \"next frontier\" for YouTube is \"the living room and subscriptions.\" Mohan wants users \"watching YouTube the way we used to sit down together for traditional TV shows—on the biggest screen in the home with friends and family,\" and says that \"viewers globally now watch more than 1 billion hours on average of YouTube content on their TVs every day.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001663#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001663&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8bd43bc7e84a552299b8e3901d4a84e623dd2ebf53aeb72c67b36553e46852e3","category":"Tech"}
