Having grown up building one-off race cars with his father, his technical schooling was a continuation of this hobby. His lifelong passion crescendoed during his final thesis project, where he designed and manufactured a carbon fiber formula race car chassis using monocoque construction. It was the first autoclave-cured tub made in Australia!</p>\n<p>To test this remarkable product, Mark entered it in the FSAE-A competition in 2004 and placed 2nd overall. He then traveled to the USA in 2005 for the largest completion of its size in the world, set the fastest lap times in the enduro, and placed 4th of 140+ teams in the design competition.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-62.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-62.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-62.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-62.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-62.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>All this to say, Mark fast-tracked his career in the world of automotive design, working for Prodrive, Bosch, and Jaguar Land Rover, where he helped design and test prototypes around the globe. Yet bicycles were a lifelong passion of Mark’s, and eventually, he left the automotive world to open Prova Cycles in 2015.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/MADE-Bike-Show-Australia-Prova-MTB-5.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/MADE-Bike-Show-Australia-Prova-MTB-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/MADE-Bike-Show-Australia-Prova-MTB-5.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/MADE-Bike-Show-Australia-Prova-MTB-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/MADE-Bike-Show-Australia-Prova-MTB-5.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>In 2020, his sister Kelly joined the team from a career of being a baker to make Prova’s carbon fiber seat tubes.

We now only try to do one of each process needed to make one frame and there was a lot of pain trying to make that work.”</p>\n<p>Prova’s goal is to have one bike leave from its shop a week. In this system, manufacturers produce the parts needed to create the whole in advance, keeping the inventory lean and then moving each part through the various stages of production.</p>\n<p>Mark’s engineering background enabled him to utilize tools like Fusion 360, a 3D modeling program, and FEA, or finite element analysis, to assist in his structural design for additive manufacturing and prototyping. These skills have informed Prova’s manufacturing intent.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-75.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-75.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-75.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-75.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-75.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Step By Step</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, Kelly and Mark use a Japanese system called <em>Kanban,</em> which translates to “signboard.” Kanban organization relies on every stage in the project’s process and is represented as a separate card on the display board. The main purpose of representing work as a card on the Kanban board is to allow team members to track progress through its workflow in a highly visual manner. Every morning, Kelly and Mark discuss the progress, and the <em>Kanban</em> system is updated, assigning each of their duties for the day.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-50.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-50.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-50.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-50.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-50.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-46.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-46.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-46.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-46.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-46.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Similar to Darren Baum’s technique of order queue organization – check out our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/catching-baum-cycles-geelong/\" target=\"_blank\">Shop Visit from 2014 here</a> – Kelly and Mark have bins with customer’s components in the office upstairs and below in the factory, each customer has a kit of parts on the production floor.

Similar to the discussion that unfolded in the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/eisentraut-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Eisentraut piece I posted last week</a>, bicycles are made from angles, and how those various angles attach has evolved over the history of bicycle fabrication.</p>\n<p>In the early days, builders would fillet braze tube-to-tube construction on a flat alignment table. Then came hand-carved lugs. The next step was investment casting, where a manufacturer like Beretta could cast thousands of lugs at different tubing angles to fast-track production. With this kit of parts on hand, production increased exponentially as countless hours were saved by brazing tubes into investment-cast lugs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-65.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-65.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-65.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-65.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-65.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>We’ve looked at other brands like <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/neuhaus-metalworks-shop-visit/\" target=\"_blank\">Neuhaus Metalworks</a> and its system of producing 3D sintered, aka printed, components in Shanghai, China, en masse and then welding frames together in the US. In many ways, 3D-printed frame components are enabling builders to speed up their building process, just as investment casting did in the late 1980s for Italian framebuilders like Cinelli, Masi, and others.</em></p>\n<p>Mark’s process at Prova is slightly different for a few reasons. Rather than offer stock sizing, Prova offers completely custom fabrication. Each of Prova’s bike models has a parametric 3D model. This allows Mark to change intergers like the angles, bottom bracket drop, and chainstay length. As he alters these parameters, the parametric model updates, creating a unique 3D-modeled part. FEA is applied to ensure the parts pass the testing, and from there, he sends the customer’s frame parts out to a New Zealand-based 3D printer that can manufacture parts in a short turnaround.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-63.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-63.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-63.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-63.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-63.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Once the parts are received in Melbourne at Prova’s factory, they go into a rock tumbler before Kelly hand-finishes them all with a combination of various air tools.

This efficiency took a concerted effort between her and Mark, who wanted to keep their order queue for around twelve months.</p>\n<p>And it’s all thanks to lean manufacturing and some unique fabrication techniques…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-10.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-10.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-10.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Titanium Processes</h3>\n<p>Titanium framebuilding requires a two-pass weld for each mitered tube junction. This is just one reason why titanium frames are so expensive to produce. That means, essentially, two steel frames could be welded in the time it takes a single titanium frame to be completed. Adding to the complexity is a lengthy purging setup.</p>\n<p>Titanium purging uses an inert gas such as Argon to protect the underside of the weld from oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen contamination. It can take up to two minutes for the system to hit optimized levels of around 50 PPM before welding in that area can continue.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-3.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-3.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Adding to the purging process is the painstaking monitoring of the heat applied to each tube as each welding pass goes down. Builders will move around the frame to minimize the tacked tubes from heating and deforming out of square. Because mitered tubes require two welding passes, the time required adds up, especially around tough-to-reach areas like seatstays and bottom brackets. All this to say that welding titanium is very labor-intensive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-25.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-25.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-25.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>A titanium fabricator is always looking for ways to shorten this lengthy process, not only to save time and money but also to protect their bodies, as hunching over a welding station locked into extreme focus causes sore muscles and tension.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-7.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-7.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-7.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-29.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-29.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-29.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>One unique way Prova optimizes frame production is by using a lip around each of its 3D-printed components. This lip gets melted down into the weld bead. So, for each connection like this, Mark doesn’t use a weld rod; he uses the actual 3D-printed component to join the tubes. This enables optimal penetration, eliminating the need for a second pass versus two passes of the traditionally welded mitered connections.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-31.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-31.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-31.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-30.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-30.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-30.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Another assemblage method Prova deploys on its frames is a 45º beveled sleeved connection, shown above in Prova’s prototype titanium fork. In this instance, the pieces are slid into position, and a filler rod is used to weld them together, creating a flush surface between the two pieces.

This stunning red Prova Speciale Disc was on display before being handed off to the customer. It features wet 2pac paint by <a href=\"https://www.velocraft.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Velocraft</a>, which is also based in Melbourne. The high-polished titanium is completed in-house.</p>\n<p>Shooting bikes like this is equal parts adoration and anxiety! They don’t want to sit still while photographing, and rightfully so. The aim for the Speciale was to create one of the lightest metal road frames. The Integrale is Prova’s take on the clean aesthetic of the hidden cable or integrated bike. It takes the Speciale platform and adds a unique headtube design using a CNC-machined lower section with a Prova-designed 3D printed upper. The bearings are Ceramic Speed solid lube bearings, and the aero cover and lock ring are Prova-designed and made of titanium. The perfect balance between road and “all-road” is measured by the Integrale LW, which has a maximum tire size of 34 mm.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-70.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-70.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-70.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-70.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-70.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-71.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-71.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-71.jpg?resize=1200,1799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-71.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-71.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-69.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-69.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-69.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-69.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-69.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Spy shots of the new Prova Mostro Integrale</em></p>\n<h3>What’s Next?</h3>\n<p>Prova will unveil two new models at MADE this year and while I’m saving one for a surprise, I got an intimate look at its new gravel model, dubbed the Mostro Integrale, which utilizes a titanium fork, a hidden seatpost wedge, custom Chris King integrated cockpit, a dropped chainstay, and clearance for a 50 mm tire.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-67.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-67.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-67.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-67.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-67.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-72.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-72.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-72.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-72.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Prova-Cycles-Shop-Visit-72.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The other bike… well, we’ll just say it’s got a lot of bounce per ounce!
