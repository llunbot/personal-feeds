But this immune suppression also makes the recipients highly susceptible to becoming infected with the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and developing severe COVID-19. Some experts estimate that transplant recipients' risk of dying from COVID-19 is as high as 20 to 30 percent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802594#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802594&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a11cc1b88b2c9377a7d77cd742a61a3c47f5e4ed217ad8d3a4bd6bc033ba8a73","category":"Tech"}
