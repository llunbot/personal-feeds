It gets installed by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability that may make millions of machines connected to the Internet potential targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit CVE-2023-33426, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10 that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming platform that’s found on many Linux machines.</p>\n<h2>Perfctl storm</h2>\n<p>The researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/persistent-stealthy-linux-malware-has-infected-thousands-since-2021/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/persistent-stealthy-linux-malware-has-infected-thousands-since-2021/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f4e502df185d6da58fc94762b5d41f6ca201fee8aa6200e36e731a4486e70d44","category":"Tech"}
