It sounds like science fiction; in fact, the idea was the plot of a <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> episode that aired in 2018. Now, biotech company LyGenesis is trying to turn the concept into reality.</p>\n<p>Today, LyGenesis announced that an initial volunteer has received an injection of donor cells to turn one of their lymph nodes into a second liver. The procedure was carried out in Houston on March 25 as part of a <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04496479\">clinical trial</a> that will test the experimental treatment in 12 adults with end-stage liver disease.</p>\n<p>These patients usually require a liver transplant, but donor organs are in short supply. LyGenesis is hoping to spur the growth of enough healthy liver tissue that patients don’t need a transplant. “We’re using the lymph node as a living bioreactor,” says Michael Hufford, cofounder and CEO of Pittsburgh-based LyGenesis. He says just 10 to 30 percent in additional liver mass could have meaningful effects for patients with end-stage liver disease.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014481#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014481&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"019b8dd54c8aacb6b164e89779310e0c9e9bab61afbba4d3ce076b28c842edc1","category":"Tech"}
