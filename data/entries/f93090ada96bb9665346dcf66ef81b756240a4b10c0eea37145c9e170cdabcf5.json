There are certain times of the year when buying a new iPhone is a bad idea, and there are certain times of the year when you can get a bargain on a new handset. The trick is knowing when you should buy a new iPhone. Luckily we are here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking for to buy a new iPhone? Apple is about to launch a replacement for the iPhone SE. Normally we would say hold off until the new iPhone launch but that depends on which phone you want to buy. Read on for more information. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I buy a new iPhone right now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to buy an iPhone 16 series handset our advice is to buy now.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you want to buy an iPhone 15 you may find that the replacement for the iPhone SE could be a better choice as it is likely to support Apple Intelligence, which the iPhone 15 doesn’t support. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>However, prices for some or all iPhones could increase, at least outside the U.S. following this iPhone SE update. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>There are certain times of the year when you can get the best deals on a new iPhone, these are during the Amazon Prime Sales in July and October, and Black Friday.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those in the market for a new handset are probably wondering whether now is a good time to buy a new iPhone. Is there any danger that a new model will be released in the near future? Will prices drop or increase?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer that question, a replacement for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone SE is expected on Wednesday, February 19.</a> If you want to buy a new iPhone that supports Apple Intelligence, but is cheaper than the iPhone 16, this will be the iPhone to buy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to buy the soon-to-launch iPhone SE, you may think that there isn’t a bad time to buy one of the older iPhones. Normally, when a new iPhone launches Apple reduces prices of the predecessors and discontinues some models. So it can be best to wait until after a new iPhone launches to get the best price for the previous generation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the case of the iPhone SE replacement we expect <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2603545/after-wednesday-the-iphone-will-never-be-the-same.html\">Apple to shake up the iPhone lineup somewhat</a>. The iPhone 14 and current iPhone SE are already off-sale in Europe where Apple isn’t allowed to sell iPhones with a lightning port. As a result, you can expect that the $599 iPhone 14 will no longer be sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the new iPhone SE costs $599 that would already be a higher price than the current iPhone SE that costs $429. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the $699 iPhone 15 not supporting Apple Intelligence, Apple’s AI features it has been making a lot of noise about, it is also possible that the company could discontinue that handset. Should Apple do so the line up may well start with a $599 iPhone SE (which may be known as the iPhone 16E). Or the iPhone 15 price could fall and the iPhone 16E may slot in above it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, waiting may mean spending more to buy your iPhone and it may mean you have less choice. Although just because Apple doesn’t sell an iPhone doesn’t mean you can’t buy it.

The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html\">iPhone 16, 16 Plus, Pro and Pro Max</a> were launched at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple Event in September</a> 2024. In September 2025 you can expect the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> line up to be revealed. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-15-vs-iPhone-16-colours.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 vs iPhone 15 colors\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-15-vs-iPhone-16-colours.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1452w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-15-vs-iPhone-16-colours.jpg?resize=300%2C120&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-15-vs-iPhone-16-colours.jpg?resize=768%2C308&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-15-vs-iPhone-16-colours.jpg?resize=1200%2C481&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"481\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should I buy an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus? </h3>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple iPhone 16</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 16\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iphone_16_lineup.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" alt=\"Editors' Choice\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2470661/iphone-16-and-16-plus-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$799\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/473657/7613?prodsku=MYAP3LL%2FA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fproduct%2FMYAP3LL%2FA%3Fcppart%3DUNLOCKED&amp;intsrc=CATF_3652\" target=\"_blank\">$829 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6417998/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$829.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus were Apple’s new standard iPhones for 2024.

That is without a doubt in the months leading up to September. So don’t buy a new iPhone in August, unless you want to be kicking yourself a month later when the price of that model drops and a new model arrives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only reason to buy an iPhone in the run-up to an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple Event</a> is if it is likely to be discontinued. Apple tends to discontinue the Pro and Pro Max models of the previous generation when it introduces the next generation, so if you want to buy one of those models you may want to buy one while you still can. However, we’d suggest that it would be wise to wait for the next-gen version which is likely to present you with more for your money. Or take advantage of discounts as vendors sell off old stock after the new models arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to buy an iPhone isn’t necessarily when a new model launches either – unless you’re desperate to have the very latest hardware. You might be happy to wait a month or two after the launch and wait for supply to catch up with demand, and for any problems with the new phones to be identified and (hopefully) fixed. The other advantage of buying around the October/November time frame is that is when shopping events, like <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/black-friday\">Black Friday</a>, take place, but as we said above, we don’t tend to see the newest iPhone models discounted much, or at all, at these events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d say that it’s fine to buy a new iPhone at any time within nine months of it launching, but if you are hoping to save some money on your purchase we’d recommend waiting a few more months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple update the iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 review 11\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Chris Martin / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing when the latest iPhones came out should help when making a judgment on whether there will be an update soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">when is the next Apple event</a> to find out if an Apple event is imminent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually updates the iPhone range at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple Event in September</a>. The iPhone 16 will be followed in 2025 by the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the iPhone SE is on a different schedule, with Apple introducing the iPhone SE models during the spring months. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670458/iphone-buying-guide.html\">iPhone buying guide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">comparison of every iPhone available to buy today</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>When do iPhone prices drop?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know based on past experience that Apple is very unlikely to drop the price of an iPhone in the first year of sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Apple does tend to reduce the price of the previous year’s iPhone when it introduces the new model – so expect Apple to discount its handsets in September (and potentially in the spring if it introduces a new iPhone SE handset at that time). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much do prices drop when a new iPhone comes out?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-pre-order-iphone-16.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"How to preorder iPhone 16\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-pre-order-iphone-16.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1361w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-pre-order-iphone-16.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-pre-order-iphone-16.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-pre-order-iphone-16.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-pre-order-iphone-16.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-pre-order-iphone-16.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple introduces new iPhones it usually keeps the prices the same, at least in the U.S. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for the iPhone 16 range are the same in the U.S. and U.K as the previous generation, but the price in Euros is less. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 Apple dropped prices for the iPhone 15 range compared to the previous year in the U.K. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025 we may see prices rise due to higher component prices and global economic headwinds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time as Apple introduces a new iPhone, it also reduces the price of existing models.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple reduced the price of the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus by $100/£100 in September 2024 when the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus were introduced. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The price of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus dropped in September 2023 and again in September  2024.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s not the only place you can buy an iPhone and it certainly isn’t the only one to discount the handsets. From time to time you will see deals from other resellers. We track these in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672801/amazing-iphone-deals-for-april-2022.html\">Best iPhone Deals round-up</a>, so check that page regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will there be Black Friday iPhone discounts?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The earliest you could expect to get a discount on the newest iPhones is around Black Friday at the end of November, so you might be planning to hold out until then. However, the deals we tend to see, if any, are usually for older handsets so if you are hoping for a discounted iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro following their launch you will probably be disappointed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nor should you expect to get a discount in an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Apple Black Friday sale</a>. Apple’s Black Friday sale usually only takes the form of vouchers with select product purchases, rather than a discount, and it is unlikely that the newest iPhone would qualify as in previous year’s new iPhones haven’t been included. See our round-up of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-iphone-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday iPhone deals</a> to see what could be in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that while shopping events like Black Friday gets all the attention, that’s not the only time you can get discounts on Apple products: we see discounts all the time. Another event where we see good iPhone deals is Prime Day, which happens in July and October every year. So take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382944/best-iphone-prime-day-deals-october-2024.html\">iPhone deals for Amazon Prime Day</a> sale to see what you might be able to save.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our experience, we don’t tend to see discounts on the newest handset until the spring–and these are always from third-party resellers, never from Apple. In fact, we don’t tend to see the iPhone discounted in the U.S. very often, most of the discounts we see are in the U.K. where unlocked iPhones are often sold off-contract at a good discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Is now a good time to buy a new iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The worst time to buy is usually between July or August, mainly because with new iPhones on the horizon the price of the older handsets are likely to drop very soon. In 2025 an additional new iPhone is expected in February, so we would also avoid shopping at that time, unless you want to buy an iPhone before it is discontinued, or to spend your money before any possible price hikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the newest iPhones then the best deals don’t tend to come before the spring and summer months. If you are happy to buy an older iPhone then you will probably see decent deals around Prime Day and Black Friday – but deals happen all year round. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this article has proved helpful in reaching an informed buying decision.
