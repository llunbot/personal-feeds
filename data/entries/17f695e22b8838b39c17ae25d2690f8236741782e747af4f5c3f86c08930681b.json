The ‌iMac‌ is equipped with the M4 chip that we first saw in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, while the ‌Mac mini‌ uses the M4 and the M4 Pro, a new higher-end chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌MacBook Pro‌ can be purchased with the M4, M4 Pro, or M4 Max chip in the 14-inch size, or with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip in the 16-inch size. Apple has bumped up the minimum RAM to 16GB, but starting prices have not changed. For the M4 Pro and M4 Max models, Apple added Thunderbolt 5, which allows for faster transfer speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Mac mini‌ has a new, slimmed down size that takes up less space on a desk, and the ‌MacBook Pro‌ and ‌iMac‌ got a nano-texture display option that cuts down on glare. The ‌Mac mini‌ is priced starting at $599, the ‌iMac‌ starts at $1,299, and the ‌MacBook Pro‌ starts at $1,599.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew Zealand doesn't have any Apple retail stores, but Apple Stores in Australia will have stock configurations of the new Macs available for walk-in purchases. Supply constraints are not expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing New Zealand and Australia, sales of the M4 Mac models‌ will begin in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/m4-macs-australia-new-zealand/\">M4 Macs Now Arriving to Customers in Australia and New Zealand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macs-now-arriving-to-customers-in-australia-and-new-zealand.2442272/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17f695e22b8838b39c17ae25d2690f8236741782e747af4f5c3f86c08930681b","category":"Apple"}
