BriefLook is a clever iPhone app that does one thing and does it well: it summarizes your postal (paper) mail. Just point your iPhone camera at a letter, and boom, a few moments later you get an AI-generated summary. Who it’s from, what it’s about, and what you’re expected to do about it. That’s useful for summarizing long letters in your own native language, but BriefLook can read and translate between <em>dozens</em> of languages. Truly an amazing use case for AI. Not too long ago a “universal mail translator / summarizer” was the stuff of science fiction. Now you can carry one in your pocket.</p>\n\n<p>Download BriefLook and try it free of charge. Super useful, yet so utterly simple.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/07/brieflook\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dbdb440948253e34bc2812652fdc06dae19b80730a78269b7df0db4550d47e9f","category":"Tech"}
