The feature would allow users to format text using simple syntax rather than relying on the app's current rich text controls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-26-Mock-Rainbow-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nMarkdown support would be a major upgrade for power users who prefer keyboard-driven formatting. Instead of tapping buttons to bold text or create headers, users could type **bold** or # Header directly into their notes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe addition would put Apple Notes on par with popular note-taking apps like Obsidian, Notion, and Bear, which have long supported the lightweight markup language. For developers and writers already familiar with Markdown from platforms like GitHub or Reddit, it would also eliminate the need to switch between apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the rumor holds up, it's likely to be unveiled at next week's Worldwide Developers Conference alongside other iOS 26 improvements, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/ios-26-messages-app-rumors/\">automatic translation and polls in Messages</a>, not to mention a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-believes-users-love-major-ios-19-redesign/\">major visual redesign</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS 26 Tahoe</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-notes/\">Apple Notes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/apple-notes-rumored-markdown-support-ios-26/\">Apple Notes Expected to Gain Markdown Support in iOS 26</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-notes-expected-to-gain-markdown-support-in-ios-26.2458174/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d614b54a4b2b0215661e54765d14fb6dd4812be0e482abe49965779f27f0145a","category":"Apple"}
