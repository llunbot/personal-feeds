Yesterday, Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) revealed that the \"<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1669\">AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act</a>\" now has the support of 60 US Senators, as well as 246 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives, making its passage an almost sure thing. Should that happen, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would be required to ensure that all new cars sold in the US had AM radios at no extra cost.</p>\n<p>\"Democrats and Republicans are tuning in to the millions of listeners, thousands of broadcasters, and countless emergency management officials who depend on AM radio in their vehicles. AM radio is a lifeline for people in every corner of the United States to get news, sports, and local updates in times of emergencies. Our commonsense bill makes sure this fundamental, essential tool doesnâ€™t get lost on the dial. With a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate, Congress should quickly take it up and pass it,\" said Sen. Markey and his co-sponsor Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).</p>\n<p>About 82 million people still listen to AM radio, according to the National Association of Broadcasters, which as you can imagine was rather pleased with the congressional support for its industry.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021104#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021104&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
