{"title":"Devan Scott on the Use of Color in ‘Skyfall’ and ‘Spectre’","link":"https://twitter.com/sadhilldevan/status/1458863501015851008?s=12","date":1636835439000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/13/switched-on-pop-james-bond\">Speaking of</a> Daniel Craig’s run as James Bond, Devan Scott put together a wonderful, richly illustrated thread on Twitter contrasting the use of color grading in <em>Skyfall</em> and <em>Spectre</em>. Both of those films were directed by Sam Mendes, but they had different cinematographers — <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005683/\">Roger Deakins</a> for <em>Skyfall</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0887227/\">Hoyte van Hoytema</a> for <em>Spectre</em>. Scott graciously and politely makes the case that <em>Skyfall</em> is more interesting and fully-realized because each new location gets a color palette of its own, whereas the entirety of <em>Spectre</em> is in a consistent color space.</p>\n\n<p>(For an essay of this sort, with so many images that go along with a few sentences of prose at a time, a Twitter thread is an outstanding medium.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.katclay.com/why-skyfall-is-a-masterclass-in-cinematography/\">Kat Clay: “Why <em>Skyfall</em> Is a Masterclass in Cinematography”</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/13/devan-scott-skyfall-spectre\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a33de59ecc55f6fab5e8fea8c086eebcb07cb1694c4eaa6f7873e59eedd859bd","category":"Tech"}
