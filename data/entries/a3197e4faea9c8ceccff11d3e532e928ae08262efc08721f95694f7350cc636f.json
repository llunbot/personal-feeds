Thankfully, there’s not a front derailleur in sight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have developed a bike for the weekend warrior that is ready to hit the trails,” said Maddy Johnson, associate merchant for adult bikes at Walmart U.S. “Many of the bikes in this sport come with a high price point. We wanted to offer our customers a more affordable option while maintaining the quality and versatility that the sport requires, and I think we’ve done that with the Ozark Trail bike!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"walmart ozark trail vibe 27.5 mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-4.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The geometry and 1x drivetrain’s gearing are more for the casual trail wanderer, and the bikes get reflectors and a kickstand, making them ready for riding around town or from trail to ice cream shop or school, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Glide is the 27.5″ bike and is aimed at mid-sized riders. The longer chainstays should keep handling neutral and smaller 8-speed cassette and larger chainring make it more suitable to the flowing singletrack winding its way through Bentonville’s downtown. MSRP is $298.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"walmart ozark trail 29er mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walmart-ozark-trail-mountain-bike-2023-3.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 29er gets tighter chainstays, a smaller chainring, wider range cassette, and sleeker frame with lower standover height. Additional cable ports could even make it dropper post compatible, and it gets an extra bottle cage mount on the downtube. If you’re definitely hitting all the trails, this one’s the more mountain bikey of the bunch, and it carries the top price of $398.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly not designed for the average Bikerumor reader, but we’re stoked to see higher quality frames and components (and no front derailleurs!!!) offered on affordable bikes that, just as with many of us, can be the gateway drug to more mountain biking.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet-800x222.jpg\" alt=\"ozark trail bicycle helmet and hydration pack hanging from handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet-800x222.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet-297x83.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet-120x33.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet-768x213.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet-1536x427.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ozarktrail-helmet.jpg 1620w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bikes join Walmart’s existing outdoor gear housebrand Ozark Trail, which includes helmets, hydration packs, tool kits, and more.
