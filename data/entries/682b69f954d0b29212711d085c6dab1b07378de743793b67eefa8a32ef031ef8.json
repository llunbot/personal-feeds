Oof. I had to watch at 1.5× speed to get through it.</p>\n\n<p>The whole interview was contentious, but Boorstin did as good a job as possible keeping it going, and asking good questions. One core tension: Musk’s week-ago declaration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/19/elon-musk-twitter-x-subscription-fees-users-posts\">that he wants to make all of Twitter/X paid-subscription-only</a>, vs. the obviousness of that being a terrible idea. Yaccarino has accepted an impossible position: pretending to run a company that she not only doesn’t actually run, but which is doing things she obviously disagrees with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> Yaccarino took out her iPhone and showed off her homescreen, and <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@chris/post/CxyW2D-Pdqc/\">it’s a rather bizarre selection and arrangement of apps</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/29/yaccarino-boorstin\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"682b69f954d0b29212711d085c6dab1b07378de743793b67eefa8a32ef031ef8","category":"Tech"}
