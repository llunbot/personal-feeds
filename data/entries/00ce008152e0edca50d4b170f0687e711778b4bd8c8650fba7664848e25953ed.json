{"title":"How to take advantage of Preview’s form-filling helper in macOS","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2253309/macos-preview-form-filling.html","date":1710493200000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Adobe added the option to mark fields that can be filled out with text, boxes that can be checked, and other helpers for form completion at least a decade ago–so long ago, it’s hard to find out when. But many organizations that offer downloadable forms on their websites haven’t gotten the message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group may not have access to Adobe Acrobat, the PDF modification software that allows editing and other features. They may be saving as or printing to PDF from Word, Pages, or other apps. Or, they may lack the resources or knowledge to populate a PDF with form elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But their omission doesn’t have to hold you back. The image and PDF viewer and editor Preview in macOS has let you add text fields and other elements for some time. Starting in macOS Sonoma, you can also click a single button to get it to help you with forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open any PDF file, and if Preview recognizes that it contains form elements, an AutoFill Form button appears in the upper-right corner of the PDF window. Click it, and the page is now populated with editable fields highlighted in pale blue. You can now click in a field to add text or click the field and drag its location. If you decline to click or it seems like Preview hasn’t recognized there were fields on a page, you can click the new <em>Show Form Filling Toolbar</em> icon, which looks like a long rectangular with an ellipsis in it (…) and a thin pencil angled at far right.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-Preview-form-fill-out-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Preview macOS app form filling\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-Preview-form-fill-out-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-Preview-form-fill-out-bordered.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-Preview-form-fill-out-bordered.png?resize=768%2C625&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-Preview-form-fill-out-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C976&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-Preview-form-fill-out-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C1249&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"976\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Preview provides a button on the toolbar for all documents and add a text button to click when it recognizes form elements (emphasis added with a red rectangle).</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The process isn’t perfect. In testing, I found that even when fields seem well delineated, Preview sometimes only generates some of the necessary text boxes. You can add more by holding Option and dragging a field to a new position. That new field lacks the blue highlighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to add additional text or other elements, you can use the Form Filling Toolbar items, which include buttons for redacting text, adding a scanned or mouse/stylus written signature, and adding text fields. For even more control, click the <em>Show Markup Toolbar </em>button in the main toolbar, which looks like a marking pen inside a circle.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-preview-form-filled-out-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Preview macOS form filling fields\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-preview-form-filled-out-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-preview-form-filled-out-bordered.png?resize=300%2C245&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-preview-form-filled-out-bordered.png?resize=768%2C627&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-preview-form-filled-out-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C980&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac911-preview-form-filled-out-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C1255&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"980\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Fields added automatically are shown with a light blue background as shown, for instance, in the area shown in a red rectangle for emphasis.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure and save the PDF if you downloaded it by clicking on an icon in an embedded preview in Safari to ensure your changes are saved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
