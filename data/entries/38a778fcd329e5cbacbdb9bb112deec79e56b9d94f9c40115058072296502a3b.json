The line includes two frame bags, a handlebar bag, and a seat-post bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each bag is waterproof, PFC-free, has taped and welded seams, and features TPU-coated zippers. The bags are constructed with 220-denier polyamide and 600-denier polyester, two fairly abrasion-resistant fabric choices. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"The Cabezon FB 4 against a white background \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Cabezon FB 4</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most interesting design note is that the seat-post bag (Cabezon SB 16) and handlebar bag (Cabezon HB 14) are two-part systems. The bags can detach from the harnesses that secure them to your frame, a handy feature which is certainly attractive to this <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wilde-bikes-new-supertramp-bikepacking-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a> journalist. Less time spent fiddling with straps and attachment points means more time on the trail or relaxing around camp. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"The Cabezon HB 14 against a white background\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Cabezon HB 14</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rectangular Cabezon HB 14 looks most at home between drop bars, but includes spacers and hook-and-loop fasteners for attachment to a variety of bikes, Deuter claims. It also rolls up from either end and has a valve so you can compress your load, then lock out air. The Cabezon SB 16 is similarly constructed with a roll-top closure and valve. Each bag in the Cabezon series comes in two colors: Atlantic (blue) and desert (tan). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"The Cabezon SB 16 against a white background \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-4-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Cabezon SB 16</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Deuter also took the occasion of the Cabezon Series launch to update its Pulse fanny packs with three new options. The flagship update is the Pulse Pro 5, which includes an elastic waist belt, back-panel spacer mesh aimed at ventilation and sweat reduction, and five liters of internal space. The Pulse 5 is similar, just without the elastic carry system and spacer mesh. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"The Pulse Pro 5 against a white background\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deuter-5-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Pulse Pro 5 includes plenty of storage options, an elastic waist belt, and space mesh in the back panel. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> A peek inside both packs reveals storage for a collection of tools, enough space to hold a tube and pump, and dedicated phone and water bottle compartments. The Pulse 3 is a pared-down version of the Pulse 5, featuring three liters of internal storage instead of five. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a price breakdown:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cabezon HB 14 — MSRP: $130</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cabezon SB 16 — MSRP: $140</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cabezon FB 4 — MSRP: $105</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cabezon FB 6 — MSRP: $115</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pulse 3 — MSRP: $95 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pulse 5 — MSRP: $110</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pulse 5 Pro — MSRP: $125</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deuter.com/us-en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>deuter.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/deuter-cabezon-series-bikepacking/\">Deuter Dips Into Bikepacking, Launches New Bag Line and Updates Fanny Packs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Andrew Marshall","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"38a778fcd329e5cbacbdb9bb112deec79e56b9d94f9c40115058072296502a3b","category":"Cycling"}
