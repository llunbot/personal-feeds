Vapor chambers work by spreading heat evenly across a larger surface area, preventing thermal throttling and maintaining consistent performance, which is particularly beneficial in slim devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the notorious thermal issues of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro were seemingly resolved thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a>'s new aluminum thermal substructure, graphene sheet, and back glass, the report claims that the device still struggles under intense thermal load. A vapor chamber heatsink would apparently resolve this and allow for better sustained performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that the ‌‌iPhone 17‌‌ Pro Max will also have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/kuo-12gb-ram-iphone-17-pro-max-exclusive/\">exclusive cooling system</a> that combines vapor chamber technology with graphene sheets. Contrary to the latest report, Kuo said that the other new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models launching in 2025 will continue to rely solely on graphene sheets.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mydrivers-com/\">MyDrivers</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-major-thermal-upgrade/\">iPhone 17 Rumored to Feature Major Thermal Design Upgrade</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-rumored-to-feature-major-thermal-design-upgrade.2447567/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a8dfb7f3ce8d592acd28f69d08f0217451b86f4053ff73646ef652e95f4fe53d","category":"Apple"}
