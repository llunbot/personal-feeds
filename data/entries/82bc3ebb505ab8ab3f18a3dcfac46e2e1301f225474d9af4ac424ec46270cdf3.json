Pricing on the 11-inch OLED iPad Pro starts at $999, and pricing on the 13-inch OLED iPad Pro starts at $1,299. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn contrast, the \"iPad\" is Apple's low-priced mainstream iPad, last updated in October 2022 with a complete redesign, larger display, USB-C port, A14 Bionic chip, 12-megapixel camera, and more. The iPad starting price is $349, but the pricey M4 iPad Pro models are proving to be more popular, and even appear to have cut into iPad mini and iPad Air sales. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to CIRP, in the June 2024 quarter, iPad Pro (both the 11-inch and 13-inch models) accounted for 43% of total iPad sales, an increase from 38% in the year-ago June 2023 quarter. Meanwhile, the iPad remained at 35% compared to the previous year. In the same time periods, iPad Air accounted for 12% of all iPad sales, down from 15% a year ago, and the iPad mini accounted for 10%, down from 12% in the June 2023 quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's worth noting that the iPad mini has not been updated by Apple since September 2021, yet the iPad Air was updated in May alongside the M4 iPad Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/CIRP-ipad-sales-june-2024-quarter.jpg\" width=\"1127\" height=\"827\" />\r<br />\nCommenting on the figures, CIRP suggests early adopters are driving the strong iPad Pro sales: \"As we've seen with many other Apple product launches, the first-acting consumers appear to have gravitated to the high-end, most expensive models available, in this case the iPad Pros.\" iPad users: Does that align with your own purchase decisions?
