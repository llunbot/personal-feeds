{"title":"Underpromise and Overdeliver","link":"https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1778819403016265869","date":1713127610000,"content":"\n<p>Eric Migicovsky (on a <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/11/automattic-beeper\">different</a> subject), in a post on Twitter/X:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aspiring consumer HW makers (big and small) - this may sound \nobvious, but my rec is to underpromise/overdeliver for your first \nversion. It’s hard because you want to balance sharing the vision \nfor what the product category will become, but get customers \nadjusted to the reality that you need to ship what’s most likely \nan MVP for your first version. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Big or small, old or new — or even hardware or software. It’s always true: underpromising and overdelivering is always the path to delight, but also always devilishly difficult to pull off. That’s the game. The subtext for Migicovsky’s tweet is obviously Humane, whose AI Pin clearly overpromises and underdelivers. Migicovsky links to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3924904/pebble-smartwatch-review\">Nilay Patel’s 2013 review of the original Pebble Smartwatch</a>, which concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After using the Pebble for a few days, I realized that I was \ndaydreaming about it: I wanted it to do more. That’s unusual — I \nrarely trust new products to work correctly, especially new \nproducts from unproven companies. But the Pebble’s charming \nsimplicity and fundamental competence inspires confidence. It’s so \ngood at what it does now that it’s easy to imagine all other \nthings it might do in the future. There’s no reason it can’t \nreplace a Fitbit or Nike Fuelband, for example, and I’d love to be \nable to send replies to emails and text directly from the device. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pebble obviously didn’t make it, but that’s the sort of 1.0 review you want to see: <em>It’s good at what it already does and I can see how it could do more in the future.</em> The one and only review of the Humane AI Pin that expresses a sentiment like that <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-pin-in-depth-review\">is Raymond Wong’s for Inverse</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@andru/post/C5tvf0sum8l/\">Andru Edwards on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fact that people on @hu.ma.ne’s PR team keep leaving, and \nthose who take over are unresponsive has been making the planning \nof this sit-down interview with them that I’ve been working on for \na few months, a challenge to say the least. Just sent another \nfollow-up 😅🤞🏽 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s generally considered a bad sign when a company experiences large-scale turnover in their PR/comms teams right around the launch of the company’s first product.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/14/humane-underpromise-overdeliver\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ee6d2354a6c419b26f65df6b9c659d5dfdccfb307a37aefcce406b9abd14a1e9","category":"Tech"}
