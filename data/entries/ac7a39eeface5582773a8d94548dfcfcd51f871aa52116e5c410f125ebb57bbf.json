Would a touchscreen actually be worthwhile on AirPods?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThe display on the fake AirPods activates when the case is opened up. It shows connectivity status, the time, the battery level of each earbud, noise control options, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>\" settings, and equalizer presets. Other additions include customizable wallpaper, a flashlight, and a feature for controlling the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou're basically only able to control settings with the display, which is mildly useful. Actual AirPods need to be controlled through an ‌iPhone‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac, with some options available through the Control Center/Status Bar and others buried in the settings app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe touchscreen on the fake AirPods is, to put it politely, garbage. It doesn't register touches some of the time, the sound is mediocre, there are non-functional buttons, and the equalizer settings just make everything sound worse.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo why did we buy these earbuds? Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/apple-airpods-case-with-touchscreen/\">patented a similar concept back in 2021</a>, describing a set of AirPods with a built-in touchscreen display that can be used to manage settings and also control playback. In Apple's patent description, there are options for adjusting volume, favoriting songs, playing and pausing, skipping songs, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple suggested that the touchscreen could offer tactile feedback and provide a more convenient way to control wireless earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe don't recommend counterfeit products, of course, so you should not go out and buy these. The fake AirPods do give us some idea of the utility of a touchscreen and how it could be used, which is interesting to imagine. Would you want an AirPods case with a touchscreen?
