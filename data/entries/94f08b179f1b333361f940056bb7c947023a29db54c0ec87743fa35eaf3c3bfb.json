{"title":"Teenage Chinese Gamers Lash Out at New Rules Limiting Them to Three Hours of Play Per Week","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/8/31/young-chinese-gamers-lash-out-at-new-limiting-rules","date":1630520613000,"content":"\n<p>Al Jazeera:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The new rules will only allow gaming platforms to offer services\nto minors from 8pm to 9pm on Fridays, weekends and public\nholidays, according to state news agency Xinhua, which cited a\nrelease by the National Press and Publication Administration.\nChina had previously restricted gaming hours for teens to 1.5\nhours per day in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>It’s “indisputable” that indulging in online games affects normal\nstudy life and the physical and mental health of teens, the\nPeople’s Daily article said. “Destroying a teenager will destroy a\nfamily.”</p>\n\n<p>Young Chinese gamers were, however, angry.</p>\n\n<p>“This group of grandfathers and uncles who make these rules and\nregulations, have you ever played games? Do you understand that\nthe best age for e-sports players is in their teens?” said one\ncomment on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.</p>\n\n<p>“Sexual consent at 14, at 16 you can go out to work but you have\nto be 18 to play games. This is really a joke.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m not predicting anything, but, this could severely backfire against the CCP. You can only push people so far before they revolt, and it’s hard to imagine how the CCP could breed more resentment than by taking away video games from teens.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/teenage-chinese-gamers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"94f08b179f1b333361f940056bb7c947023a29db54c0ec87743fa35eaf3c3bfb","category":"Tech"}
