You’ll also get the new Adaptive Transparency mode that automatically blocks out harmful noises, along with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">several new features</a> coming later this month in iOS 17.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0BDHWDR12/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods (3rd-gen with Lightning case)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $150</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings:</strong> $19</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why it’s a great deal:</strong> Apple’s 3rd-gen AirPods have a slightly refreshed design that looks a bit like AirPods Pro and brings several upgrades over the previous model, including personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, sweat and water resistance, adaptive EQ, and longer battery life. Just note: This model doesn’t have a wireless charging case and needs to be plugged in with a Lightning cable to charge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods (2nd-gen)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings: </strong>$30</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why it’s a great deal:</strong> Of course, Apple’s older AirPods are missing all of the new features found in the 3rd-gen model, but you won’t find many better buds for less than $100.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods Max</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $450</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings:</strong> $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why it’s a great deal: </strong>Earbuds aren’t for everyone, which is why Apple makes AirPods Max. Apple’s highest-end headphones have a striking mesh-and-metal design with magnetic ear cups that come in five colors. They’re a bit long in the tooth to pay full price, but for $100 off you’ll get incredible sound, noise cancelation, spatial audio, and 20 hours of battery life.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"70a767b7eac373b2ec798939ab05e642678033f543bc89edb0bc886c1dbde384","category":"Apple"}
