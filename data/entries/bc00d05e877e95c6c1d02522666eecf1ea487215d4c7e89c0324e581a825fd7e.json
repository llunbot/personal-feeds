Instead of progressing through a level from start to finish, players are expected to hunker down inside a somewhat circular arena and then contend with hundreds of enemies spawning from all sides. Kill a full \"wave\" of foes, and your team will get a moment to breathe, replenish health and ammo (or argue over who gets to use it), and do it all over again.</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Quake-8-980x551.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          A quick peek at the four brand-new Horde maps in <em>Quake 1</em>, all built by the <em>Quake</em>-obsessed team at MachineGames.

Each includes at least one \"silver key\" door, which is full of more powerful weapons and is gated until players earn a key by defeating a tougher \"boss wave\" of foes. Get through nine enemy waves, and your team gets a \"gold key.\" You can either exit the level at that point or stay and keep fighting increasingly tough foes until your team dies. (If you're hunting for in-game achievements or trophies, Bethesda hasn't updated <em>Quake</em> with any new ones for Horde, if that changes whether your team uses the gold key or not.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817582#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817582&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc00d05e877e95c6c1d02522666eecf1ea487215d4c7e89c0324e581a825fd7e","category":"Tech"}
