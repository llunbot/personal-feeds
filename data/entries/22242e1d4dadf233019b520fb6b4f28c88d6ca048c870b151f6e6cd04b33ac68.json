[credit:\n                              <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240220195209/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim\">PlayStation Direct</a>\n                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>When we first received our PlayStation 5 review unit from Sony in 2020, we reacted with some bemusement to the \"8K\" logo on the box and its implied promise of full 7630×4320 resolution output. We then promptly forgot all about it since native 8K content <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294400/8k-tv-shipments-worldwide/\">and 8K compatible TVs</a> have remained a relative curiosity thus far in the PS5's lifespan.</p>\n<p>But on Wednesday, Digital Foundry's John Linneman discovered that Sony has quietly removed that longstanding 8K label from the PS5 box. The ultra-high-resolution promise no longer appears on <a href=\"https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim\">the packaging shown on Sony's official PlayStation Direct store</a>, a change that appears to have happened between <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240121065345/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim\">late January</a> and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240220195209/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim\">mid-February</a>, according to Internet Archive captures of the store page (the old \"8K\" box can still be seen at <a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/playstation-5/consoles/products/sony-playstation-5-console/11108140.html\">other online retailers</a>, though).</p>\n<h2>A promise deferred</h2>\n<p>This packaging change has been a long time coming since the PS5 hasn't technically been living up to its 8K promise for years now. While Sony's Mark Cerny mentioned the then-upcoming hardware's 8K support <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/\">in a 2019 interview</a>, the system eventually launched with a pretty big \"coming soon\" caveat for that feature. \"PS5 is compatible with 8K displays at launch, and after a future system software update will be able to output resolutions up to 8K when content is available, with supported software,\" the company <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/\">said in an FAQ</a> surrounding the console's 2020 launch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029499#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029499&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"22242e1d4dadf233019b520fb6b4f28c88d6ca048c870b151f6e6cd04b33ac68","category":"Tech"}
