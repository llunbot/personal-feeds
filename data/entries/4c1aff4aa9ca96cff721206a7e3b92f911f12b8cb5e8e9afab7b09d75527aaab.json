{"title":"Latest iOS 18 and tvOS 18 Betas Add Apple TV InSight Feature","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/apple-tv-insight-ios-18-beta-3/","date":1720569120000,"content":"With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/\">third betas</a> of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, and tvOS 18, Apple has added InSight to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app. InSight was announced as a new addition in the latest software updates at WWDC, but it was not implemented in earlier betas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-insight-tv-app.jpg\" width=\"1943\" height=\"1093\" />\r<br />\nAvailable for some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> shows and movies, InSight provides details on the actors in each scene and any music that's playing. InSight is located at the bottom of the ‌Apple TV‌ app interface when a show is playing, and it updates dynamically.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nActor names are displayed in a list, and if you tap on one, the show is moved to picture-in-picture mode and the TV app displays other shows and moves that person has appeared in. Tapping on a song name adds it to a \"Saved Songs\" section in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInSight is particularly useful on an ‌Apple TV‌ running tvOS 18 because if you connect an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> running ‌iOS 18‌, you can see InSight information in the Remote app without interrupting the show or movie.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInSight is similar to the Amazon X-Ray feature available for Prime Video content, but it does not provide trivia or full cast information. As of right now, InSight is not available for all ‌Apple TV+‌ shows, and appears to be limited to newer series. Apple will likely bring the feature to additional content prior to when ‌iOS 18‌, ‌iPadOS 18‌, and tvOS 18 launch.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/apple-tv-insight-ios-18-beta-3/\">Latest iOS 18 and tvOS 18 Betas Add Apple TV InSight Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-ios-18-and-tvos-18-betas-add-apple-tv-insight-feature.2431021/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4c1aff4aa9ca96cff721206a7e3b92f911f12b8cb5e8e9afab7b09d75527aaab","category":"Apple"}
