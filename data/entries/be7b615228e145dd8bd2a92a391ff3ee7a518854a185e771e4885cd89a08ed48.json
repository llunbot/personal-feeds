According to the Commission, Apple violated the DMA by restricting developers from informing users about alternative payment options outside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and by preventing the distribution of iOS apps through competing app marketplaces.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpeaking to <em>Reuters</em>, a spokesperson for the White House condemned the EU's actions, signaling growing transatlantic tensions over regulation of U.S. technology firms:<blockquote>This novel form of economic extortion will not be tolerated by the United States. Extraterritorial regulations that specifically target and undermine American companies, stifle innovation, and enable censorship will be recognized as barriers to trade and a direct threat to free civil society.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said it plans to appeal the decision. The company called it \"another example of the commission unfairly targeting the company\" with actions that are \"bad for the privacy and security of our users.\" The penalties represent approximately 0.1% of each company's annual revenue, which is significantly below the potential maximum fine of 10% allowed under the DMA.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ruling comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between the EU and the U.S., which could potentially add another layer of complexity to transatlantic tech regulations.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/\">United States</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/white-house-hits-back-at-eu-fine/\">White House Hits Back at Apple's Massive EU Fine</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/white-house-hits-back-at-apples-massive-eu-fine.2455875/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"be7b615228e145dd8bd2a92a391ff3ee7a518854a185e771e4885cd89a08ed48","category":"Apple"}
