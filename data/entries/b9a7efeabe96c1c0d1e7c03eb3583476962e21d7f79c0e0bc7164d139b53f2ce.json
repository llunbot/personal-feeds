A new report from Bloomberg claims Apple is pushing several planned new products into 2024 as part of a cost-cutting plan designed to avoid layoffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his latest <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-19/apple-cost-cutting-efforts-no-layoffs-but-less-travel-and-delayed-bonuses-lffgahkd&amp;xcust=1-1-1663995-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Power On newsletter</a>, Mark Gurman reports that “some projects” planned for 2023 have been “pushed back until next year at the earliest.” Among the products delayed, according to the report, is the rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1653915/homepod-screen-launch-2024-report.html\">HomePod with a screen</a>, as Apple looks to “allocate its research and development budget to more pressing projects.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman claims the delayed projects are the result of a company-wide effort to reduce costs and avoid the kind of layoffs seen at Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and other tech companies. Among the other measures being taken:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Teams that traditionally receive two bonuses a year will now receive one bonus in October (though the amount will reportedly be the same).</li><li>Hiring has been frozen for some teams and limited for others.</li><li>Travel budgets have been “significantly” reduced.</li><li>Apple isn’t replacing some retail positions after workers leave and is “taking a closer look at work attendance and hours.”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to launch several new products in 2023, including an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Apple silicon Mac Pro</a> and a long-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">AR headset</a>. Gurman doesn’t say whether either of those highly anticipated products is among the ones being delayed, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see either of them pushed to 2024.  </p>\n\nApple</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b9a7efeabe96c1c0d1e7c03eb3583476962e21d7f79c0e0bc7164d139b53f2ce","category":"Apple"}
