Codenamed Sequoia, the new release brings a combination of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/\">iOS 18 features</a> and a few Mac-specific things to the devices it supports.</p>\n<p>Users who split their time between Windows and macOS will be the most excited to see that Apple has finally implemented a form of automated window tiling in macOS. This makes it easier to arrange windows automatically on your screen without manually dragging and resizing each one individually or switching into full-screen mode.</p>\n<p>Another feature called iPhone Mirroring sends your iPhone's screen to your Mac, so you can use apps directly on your phone while manipulating them using your Mac's keyboard and trackpad. The iPhone audio is also streamed to your Mac. For privacy's sake, your phone's screen stays locked while apps are streaming to your Mac, and your Mac can also receive your iPhone notifications alongside your Mac notifications (no word on how the operating systems will handle duplicate notifications from Messages, Calendar, or other apps that are getting the same updates on both platforms).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030136#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030136&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae0a62c9222ae9ee8aa59419d4bdf3fcd5924dd3c72838a31b9d15bf67c4d203","category":"Tech"}
