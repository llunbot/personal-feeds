The company is doing the review as part of <a href=\"https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified\">a new informational program called \"Deck Verified.\"</a></p>\n<p>Games that provide \"a great, smooth experience\" and \"work great on Steam Deck right out of the box\" will receive a green \"Deck Verified\" check mark on the Steam store and library interfaces. They will also appear on the default \"Great on Deck\" tab when the Store is viewed on the Steam Deck itself. Games will receive that check mark if they meet the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Input:</strong> Games must have \"full controller support\" and the ability to access all content using the Steam Deck controls, with no adjustments necessary. This includes the use of on-screen \"glyphs\" that match those of the Steam Deck buttons or those on the Xbox 360/One (many Steam games already do this for compatibility with console versions or console controllers). Any in-game text entry must be done using only the controller or an on-screen keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Display:</strong> Games must include native support for 1280x800 or 1280x720 resolution and include a default configuration that runs at a \"playable framerate\" on the hardware at that resolution (Valve has previously promised that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/valve-promises-steam-deck-will-run-the-entire-steam-library-at-30-fps/\">\"really the entire Steam library\" can meet this threshold</a> on the Steam Deck hardware). On-screen text should also be legible when the screen is held 12 inches from the face; Valve says this means no letter should be less than 9 pixels in height, though a 12-pixel height is recommended.</li>\n<li><strong>Seamlessness:</strong> Games shouldn't throw up any compatibility warnings when running on Steam Deck, and players must be able to navigate any third-party launchers with the controller.</li>\n<li><strong>System support:</strong> The game must be compatible with the SteamOS natively or with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/valves-steam-play-uses-vulkan-to-bring-more-windows-games-to-linux/\">the Proton compatibility layer</a> that allows Windows games to run on the Linux-based system. This includes any middleware and/or anti-cheat software used in the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver1-640x400.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver1.jpg\">An example of a game that meets all the Deck Verified criteria.</a> </p></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver2-640x400.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver2.jpg\">Older games might need some updates to fully reach Deck Verified status.</a> </p></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver3.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver3-640x400.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/deckver3.jpg\">VR games like </a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/half-life-alyx-review-the-greatest-vr-adventure-game-yet-and-then-some/\"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a> will officially show up as \"Unsupported\" on the Steam Deck. </p></div>\n<p>Games that don't quite reach the Verified ideal can still earn a yellow \"Playable\" badge if they run but \"require some extra effort to interact with or configure.\" That includes games that require manual controller or graphics configuration on first launch, games with \"missing or inaccurate controller glyphs,\" and games where players need to use the touchscreen for whatever reason.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805464#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805464&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c7f95a2af3c2707817bc8261dc434724b4eaf6d0f1ad856e14ba6ad69449ea5","category":"Tech"}
