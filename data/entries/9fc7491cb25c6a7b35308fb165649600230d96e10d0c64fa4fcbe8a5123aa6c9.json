App Store policy doesn't permit an app to have a single character title on its App Store listing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickjsheriff/status/1684935759529480192?s=20\">as pointed out by Nick Sheriff</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApparently X received special treatment from Apple, which is more than Musk got when he ordered the Twitter signage to be replaced at the company's headquarters in San Francisco last week. Five letters were taken down from the office's large vertical sign before work was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66300107\">interrupted by police</a> who were concerned about the lack of safety measures to protect pedestrians walking beneath the operation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/31/twitter-x-new-logo-complaints-san-francisco-hq\">A giant pulsing X</a> has since been erected on the roof of the building, and that has also drawn the ire of city officials after neighbors <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realchrisjbeale/status/1685353135236403200\">complained</a> it was intrusive. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Our HQ in San Francisco tonight <a href=\"https://t.co/VQO2NoX9Tz\">pic.twitter.com/VQO2NoX9Tz</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1685211486669484032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nThe X branding has been criticized by some commentators for being uninspired, as well as for the letter's long association with porn websites. The new name for the social media platform also means that Twitter Blue is now called \"X Blue,\" which could be doubly suggestive of lewd content. The subscription service allows users to upload up to three hours of video, up from the previous two-hour limit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwitter/X CEO Linda Yaccarino <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?s=20\">said</a> the platform will be powered by AI and offer users \"unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities... X will connect us all in ways we're just beginning to imagine.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/31/twitter-turns-to-x-apple-app-store/\">Twitter Finally Turns to 'X' on Apple's App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-finally-turns-to-x-on-apples-app-store.2397357/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9fc7491cb25c6a7b35308fb165649600230d96e10d0c64fa4fcbe8a5123aa6c9","category":"Apple"}
