Sure, you no longer need to plug a wire into your smartphone, mouse, et cetera, but you still need to place it on a charging pad to charge it. And placing it on a pad doesn't save that much time over plugging a cable into it.Â Over-the-air charging, on the other hand, is closer to what I envisioned when I first heard the term wireless charging. You're not required to lay your device on any product in order for it to recharge. That vision should soon become a reality with true wireless charging products, like a smartwatch and smart home camera expected to debut next year.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Archos, a French company that makes Android-powered tablets and smartphones, air purifiers, and <a href=\"https://www.archos.com/products/crypto/archos_safetmini/index.html\">Safe-T Mini</a>, a cryptowallet, announced a partnership with Ossia, the Washington-based maker of over-the-air charging technology. Archos is currently making plans to design and build a smartwatch, indoor security camera, air monitor, and smart tracker that can charge their batteries without using a cable or charging pad.</p>\n<p>Each device will hold a Cota Power Receiver, which is a small silicon chip that sends out a beacon signal that Ossia says is harmless. That signal bounces off any inanimate objects in its path in order to hit a Cota transmitter. Once that signal is received by the Cota transmitter, it responds by sending power over the air via a 5.8 GHz frequency to the device holding the receiver. <a href=\"https://www.ossia.com/cota/#section-next\">According to Ossia</a>, the devices speak to each other 100 times per second.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813741#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813741&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"16bea4f123f4311c25576143975393f56e51064ccebfd571c6d7a17c0e87e20a","category":"Tech"}
