If OnePlus sticks to the previous schedule, this phone will be released in China this year and early next year in the US, and it will be one of the first with a lot of new 2024 tech.</p>\n<p>We have specs and pictures to go over, with the big news being the promise of a massive 5400 mAh battery packed into the usual 6.7-inch body size. Usually, devices of this size ship with 5000 mAh batteries. Given that the phone doesn't look noticeably thicker and that manufacturers have a phobia of thicker phones, we're going to assume this is from a sizable year-over-year increase in battery density.</p>\n<p>This device is timed to coincide with the release of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, so this will be one of the first products with Qualcomm's 2024 chip. Not much is known about it, though. The company will pick from Arm's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/arm-announces-the-cortex-x4-for-2024-plus-a-14-core-m2-fighter/\">next-generation parts box</a>, but with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1639054280869937159\">report</a> from Kamila Wojciechowska suggesting the chip has a \"2+3+2+1\" core configuration, it doesn't sound like Qualcomm will be following Arm's layout recommendations. The chip is also rumored to drop 32-bit support after Qualcomm <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/the-snapdragon-8-gen-2-brings-wi-fi-7-sticks-with-some-32-bit-support/\">delayed</a> the 64-bit-only transition last year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954791#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954791&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c759d4831e75c544332040e22c1b6f749ac3cfca0d079c840b3cb4afee35bb76","category":"Tech"}
