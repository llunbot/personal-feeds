A lot of to-do apps support that, but I feel Todoist does it best.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980998#p3\">Read 52 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980998&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"37c7c45895555fe39c3fd1772344087d64419fd95295b928ab73b27fbc38c5cb","category":"Tech"}
