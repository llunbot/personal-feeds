The employees that are part of the downsizing handle the construction and upkeep of Apple retail locations worldwide.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/apple-park-night-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIt is not clear how many positions Apple is eliminating, but <em>Bloomberg</em> says the cuts are \"likely very small.\" Still, this is the first known report of Apple culling its internal workforce to cut spending. Back in June 2022, the company laid off up to 100 contractors that handled recruiting, but contractors are not full-time workers. Apple has also cut engineers and security guards that held contracting roles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple told employees that these are not layoffs, but streamlining, and that the changes are aimed at improving the upkeep of stores globally. Those who were cut have the option to reapply for positions similar to their prior job, and those who do not take on a new role could get up to four months of pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple in November <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/03/apple-hiring-freeze-cost-cutting/\">paused hiring</a> for most jobs outside of research and development, and in March of this year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/apple-cutting-costs-hiring-freeze-bonus-delay/\">expanded the hiring freeze</a>. For many teams, Apple has halted hiring, and when employees leave, positions are being left open. Slowing hiring has allowed Apple to avoid the widespread layoffs that other tech companies have announced in recent months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwitter has eliminated thousands of employees following the takeover by Elon Musk, and last month, Facebook announced plans <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/meta-facebook-layoffs.html\">to lay off</a> approximately 10,000 employees. Microsoft cut its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23638823/microsoft-ethics-society-team-responsible-ai-layoffs\">AI ethics team</a> in March following several prior layoff events, and Google parent company Alphabet laid off 12,000 employees <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/01/20/google-layoffs-jobs-employees-cut/11088409002/\">in January</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/apple-corporate-retail-employee-layoffs/\">Apple Laying Off Some Corporate Retail Employees</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-laying-off-some-corporate-retail-employees.2385793/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f9af50778cde35110beaa712a7c6e477a78e2275f6f7c145720457e3bc9b2a21","category":"Apple"}
