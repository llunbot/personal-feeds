This February, ColorWare debuted its ColorWare Retro Collection with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a> that have a unique design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/retro-airpods-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1776\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nThe Retro ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 and ‌AirPods 4‌ come in a matte cream color ColorWare is calling \"Light Mode,\" and a matte black \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a>\" shade. Both models feature colorful rainbow accents that harken back to the rainbow colors that Apple used for some of its original Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Retro ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 are priced at $499, and the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC are priced at $439, so there is a premium for a custom design, but it's worth it if you want a look you can't get elsewhere. ColorWare uses a proprietary painting process to ensure the finish will hold up over time, and it's been customizing devices for more than a decade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/colorware-supernova.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1776\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nColorWare uses a multi-step coating process that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and an X2 liquid plastic coating that protects the color, with all products warrantied for 12 months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/colorwareairpodsproblack.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" />\r<br />\nWe have two sets of ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 or ‌AirPods 4‌ (winner picks) to give away to a lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
