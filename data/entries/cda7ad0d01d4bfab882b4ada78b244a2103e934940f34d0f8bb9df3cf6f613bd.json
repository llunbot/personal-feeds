There are two charging coils inside, shielding for heat dissipation, and a magnetic ring that allows it to attach to ‌iPhone 12‌ models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two batteries inside that are connected together, with the previously known 11.13 watt hour energy and 7.62 voltage. Each individual battery is 5.733Wh, based on the internal labeling.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt the back of the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, there's a large metal plate to help with heat dissipation. Underneath the heat shields on the front, there are all of the chips that allow the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ to function.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nImages from Charger Lab's teardown surfaced earlier this week, but this is the first time the full video has been available and it's well worth watching for those who are interested in what's inside the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ can be <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJWY3AM/A/magsafe-battery-pack\">purchased from Apple's website</a> for $99.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/magsafe-battery-pack-teardown/\">Teardown Shows Off What's Inside Apple's New MagSafe Battery Pack</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/teardown-shows-off-whats-inside-apples-new-magsafe-battery-pack.2305133/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=J58p5AHxxd0:RODp3VeQljE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=J58p5AHxxd0:RODp3VeQljE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/J58p5AHxxd0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cda7ad0d01d4bfab882b4ada78b244a2103e934940f34d0f8bb9df3cf6f613bd","category":"Apple"}
