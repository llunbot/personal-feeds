The employee selected an Xcode tab within ChatGPT, which tells the AI chatbot to look at the app, and prompted the chatbot to \"add the missing planets.\" The chatbot was able to complete the task, writing a line of code to represent the Earth that matched the rest of the project's format.</blockquote>\r<br />\nBack in October, GitHub <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/github-brings-copilot-to-xcode/\">brought Copilot integration</a> to Xcode, with Copilot providing coding assistance right in the app. ChatGPT's integration is not that deep, and it is not able to write code in Xcode. ChatGPT is instead using the macOS Accessibility API for screen readers that allows apps to read text, which also means that it cannot interpret images or videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ChatGPT for Mac feature is available for ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Teams users starting today, with Enterprise and Edu support coming in the near future. Going forward, OpenAI plans to bring this integration to other apps.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/openai-chatgpt-xcode-for-mac/\">OpenAI's ChatGPT for Mac Now Works With Xcode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openais-chatgpt-for-mac-now-works-with-xcode.2442995/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7b9d4ddced971219812803d35f6efc3eef438044fda60654953aa8d2383395d","category":"Apple"}
