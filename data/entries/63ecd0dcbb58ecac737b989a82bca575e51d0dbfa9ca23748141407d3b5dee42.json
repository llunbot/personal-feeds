Since its inception, Plaza2Peak has spread purely by word of mouth. The first year, there were only seven participants including the organizer, Madeleine “Maddawg” Carey.</p>\n<p>She launched this expedition-style race with one goal: riders power themselves from the Plaza in downtown Santa Fe to the top of Deception Peak. For the first leg, they can run or bike up to the base of the ski valley, then transition to ski gear and skim up and down the mountain.</p>\n<p>This year, 56 participants showed up to compete in three categories: runners, bikers, and expedition mode. In my opinion, the latter option was the most exciting to photograph. Expeditioners strap skis to their bikes however they can manage. That means a wide variety of setups, and it was fascinating to see how they balanced weight and convenience. Some even carried skis on their backs – woof.</p>\n<p>I caught up with Maddawg to ask about the future of the race. She shared some great stories from past editions too. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-46.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-46.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-46.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-46.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-43.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-43.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Take us back to the beginning. How did the idea for Plaza2Peak come to life?</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up in Albuquerque, and my high school cross country coach – who was also the wildlife biology teacher and a volunteer firefighter – made practice all about big outdoor adventures. For me, fitness has always been about going somewhere.</p>\n<p>When I moved to Santa Fe in 2014, it felt obvious that getting from town to a high point in the mountains under human power just had to happen. I floated the idea to a few friends, and in 2015 we had our first race: seven participants, including myself and Nick (my partner). Three of the original finishers even came back for this year’s race.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the very first race like? Any memorable moments?</strong></p>\n<p>So silly. We put my Weber grill in the back of my F-250 and someone drove it up. I participated and organized. There were beers and sausages. Everyone loved it.</p>\n<p>Famously, our friend Sarah, who now runs the post-race picnic, picked up on some vibes between me and Nick. I tried to make out with him after the race and he turned me down. We’re married now, with a kid.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>How has the local community helped shape the event?</strong></p>\n<p>I couldn’t do this race without my community. My friend Anna, a professional event planner, helps with all the details. And Sarah, the friend I mentioned earlier, organizes all the food along with cheering on her husband, who has expeditioned every race.</p>\n<p>This year, prizes came from Tourist, an incredible local gear shop, and Racing Apparel, a longtime supporter and perennial podium finisher.</p>\n<p>And of course, the racers! The event is very word-of-mouth. Otherwise, it’d get too big to manage with our current setup. I’m so grateful to everyone who shows up because a friend forwarded them an email, and to the diehards who’ve done every single race.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any favorite racer stories?</strong></p>\n<p>One year, our friend Scott was going through a breakup. He rode a fat bike from the Plaza to a breakfast spot, crushed a burrito, then pedaled up the Winsor Trail until he hit snow around 9,000 feet. He just kept going – hike-a-biking up Aspen Vista to the summit and down the ski basin. It was close to a 30-mile day. He said he ran out of demons about halfway up and rolled into the post-race picnic with bloody shins.</p>\n<p>Another year, a friend from high school – a pretty serious bike racer – crashed on the road section and ran the last six miles in his bike shoes.</p>\n<p>And I’ll never forget the participant who told me he’d trained all year for the race. He said it was the hardest thing he’d ever done. He cried at the finish. That’s what this day is about: challenging yourself to go far, fast, and efficiently.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-32.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-32.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-37.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-37.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-37.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-37.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-34.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-34.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-34.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Plaza2Peak-34.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Now that you’ve hit 10 years, what’s next? Any dreams for the next decade of Plaza2Peak?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s always a tension between growing the event and keeping the low-key, underground vibe people love. We’ve gone from 7 to 56 in ten years. I’d love to see 500 in the next ten.</p>\n<p>Historically, we’ve never had permits. When I approached the City a few years ago, they told me not to get a permit until they force me to. So one of my goals next year is more paperwork: with the City, the County, and the Forest Service.</p>\n<p>Mostly, I just want to keep it going – and one day, in 25 years, hand it off to some 20-something.</p>\n<p>I also think about expanding into other events. I’m an organizer at heart, always looking for ways to help people experience their landscapes. Maybe we’ll take Plaza2Peak to other ski areas, or start something else entirely in Northern New Mexico. If folks have ideas, I’m all ears!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Big thanks to Madeleine for the chance to share this story.
