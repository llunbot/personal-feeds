Co-showrunner Steve Yockey (<em>Supernatural</em>), who created the series, aptly describes it as \"the <em>Hardy Boys</em> on acid.\" You've got vengeful witches, demons, psychic mediums, cursed masks, foul-mouthed parasitic sprites, talking cats—and, of course, the titular ghostly detectives, intent on spending their afterlife cracking all manner of mysterious paranormal cases.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(comic_book)\">Sandman</a></em> fans first encountered the Dead Boys in the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman:_Season_of_Mists\">Seasons of Mist</a>\" storyline, in which the ghost Edwin Paine and Charles Rowland meet for the first time in 1990. Edwin had been murdered at his boarding school in 1916 and spent decades in Hell. When Lucifer abandoned his domain, Hell was emptied, and Edwin was among the souls who returned to that boarding school. Charles was a living student whom Edwin tried to protect. Charles ultimately died and chose to join Edwin in his afterlife adventures. The characters reappeared in the <em>Children's Crusade</em> crossover series, in which they decided to become detectives.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019722#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019722&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b886b6a433d0e9e011dc4ed737b3d2a94fbc79c6f99e0e389fcec4899c4cad6","category":"Tech"}
