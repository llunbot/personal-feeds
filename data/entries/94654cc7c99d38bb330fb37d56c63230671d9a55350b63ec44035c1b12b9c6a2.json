Once again Tadej Pogačar is the overwhelming favourite for victory. After all, he is the defending champion, and he literally rode away from the field last year on his way to scoring his second win in three years. But while he could well equal Fabian Cancellara's record of three wins this year, neither Pogačar nor his UAE Team Emirates – XRG were leaving anything to chance, as they prepared for the annual pre-race recon on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Strade Bianche is one of the rare races in the cycling calendar where riders always ride recon, as the notorious gravel roads found in this corner of Tuscany take on a life of their own, often changing with the weather. </p>\n<p><em>Rouleur</em> joined Pogačar and his team for the day as they scoped the crucial sections of Strade Bianche. On tap were the final 115 kilometres of the race, a race the world champion plans on winning once again.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01_Pogacar_Strade_Recon_Rouleur_02_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741277939\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar, Strade Bianche recon\" /></div>\n<p>Pogačar walks towards the team bus as he readies for his annual Strade Bianche recon on Thursday morning.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/03_Pogacar_Strade_Recon_Rouleur_02_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741278341\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar, Strade Bianche recon\" /></div>\n<div>\nPogačar is suited and ready to go in the rainbow-banded kit of the world champion.<br />\n</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06_Pogacar_Strade_Recon_Rouleur_02_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741278442\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar, Strade Bianche recon\" /></span></div>\n<div>Pogačar looks over his bike before the day's ride.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/07_Pogacar_Strade_Recon_Rouleur_02_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741278502\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar, Strade Bianche recon\" /></span></div>\n<div>\n<p>The UAE Emirates - XRG team opted to start the ride on Sarravalle sector, a new edition to this year's race and a section that will be included in this year's <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia\">Giro d'Italia</a>.</p>\n<p>\"It's a very long and narrow sector,\" says sports director Manuel Mori, a native of Tuscany. \"It will be important on Saturday, but also in the Giro, and a rider could really lose time if he is not well placed.\"</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/08_Pogacar_Strade_Recon_Rouleur_02_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741278975\" alt=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia\" />Pogačar leads his team into the San Martino in Grania sector, another of the race's long and crucial gravel roads, and it is here where the race really starts to break up each year. <img alt=\"Tadej Pogačar, Strade Bianche\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/09_Pogacar_Strade_Recon_Rouleur_02_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741279160\" />\n<p>The Slovenian stops to remove some layers in the warm early spring sunshine in Tuscany.</p>\n<span><img alt=\"Tadej Pogačar, Strade Bianche\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/10_Pogacar_Strade_Recon_Rouleur_02_2025_1024x1024.jpg?v=1741279445\" /></span>The Monte Sainte Marie is one of the most crucial sectors in the race.
