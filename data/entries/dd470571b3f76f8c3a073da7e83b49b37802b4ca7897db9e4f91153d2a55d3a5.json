Today, Sony is ready to do something about all that bulk, <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/10/new-look-for-ps5-console-this-holiday-season/\">announcing new models</a> of both the PS5 and the PS5 Digital Edition in a \"new slimmer size.\"</p>\n<p>The new units—which will be rolling out via \"select local retailers\" and <a href=\"https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/\">PlayStation Direct</a> this month—sport the same internal hardware power as the circa 2020 PS5. But these new models come with a 30-plus percent reduction in volume and an 18 to 24 percent reduction in weight compared to current PS5 models, according to Sony. They also feature a 1TB SSD that the PlayStation Blog describes as \"more internal storage\" than the original units, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/our-playstation-5-has-arrived-heres-what-we-can-show-you-thus-far/\">officially listed 825GB of storage space</a>.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ps5slim.jpeg\"><img alt=\"From this angle I can't help but see the slit in the new faceplate as a bemused cartoony mouth...\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ps5slim-640x427.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ps5slim-1280x854.jpeg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ps5slim.jpeg\">From this angle I can't help but see the slit in the new faceplate as a bemused cartoony mouth...</a> (credit: Sony)</p></div>\n<p>Besides the thinner profile, the slimmer units also feature a striking curved slit bisecting each faceplate into \"glossy\" and \"matte\" sections (new colored faceplates for these models will be available for $54.99 starting in early 2024, Sony says). Unfortunately, the redesign means the new models won't be able to stand vertically out of the box—a $29.99 Vertical Stand will be required for that orientation now. But the front-facing USB-A port on the current PS5 has also been replaced with a second USB-C port on the new models, fully cementing the move to the new standard.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974850#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974850&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dd470571b3f76f8c3a073da7e83b49b37802b4ca7897db9e4f91153d2a55d3a5","category":"Tech"}
