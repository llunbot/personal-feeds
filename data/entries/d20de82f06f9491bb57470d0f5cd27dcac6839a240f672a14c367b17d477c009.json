The iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, and the Max has a 6.9-inch display. That's primarily thanks to thinner borders around the displays.</p>\n<p>Like the iPhone 15 Pro, the 16 Pro is made of titanium but with a new texture. Apple claims the phone has improved heat management with its new chassis, which could address some of our complaints about the iPhone 15 Pro—that means up to 20 percent faster sustained performance, too.</p>\n<p>Larger batteries and efficiency improvements have led to a promise of battery life improvements, though Apple didn't say exactly how much longer they'll last during the livestream.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048412#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048412&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d20de82f06f9491bb57470d0f5cd27dcac6839a240f672a14c367b17d477c009","category":"Tech"}
