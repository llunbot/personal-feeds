The eruption blasted rocks and ash a dozen miles into the air, and then heavy rainfall swept the fallen debris up in immense mudflows. A river of rubble carved a destructive path through the nearby town of Chaitén before surging into the sea. The town, practically split in two by the torrent that cut through its middle, was evacuated as ash blanketed over 200,000 square kilometers of surrounding land.</p>\n<p>While the terrestrial aftermath was plain to see, captured by both the local media and satellites, the impact on the sea was unknown.</p>\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-980x653.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FKt240902-20240906-ViewsAroundChaitenRegion-Ingle-6557-1440x960.jpg 1440w\" />\n      Mists shroud the hillsides at the entrance to Chaitén Bay, as seen from aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s &lt;em&gt;Falkor (too)&lt;/em&gt; research vessel.\n        Credit:\n           Alex Ingle / Schmidt Ocean Institute\n      \n<p>The eruption released over 750 billion liters of lava—enough to fill more than 300,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools—mainly in the form of rock fragments.
