It retains the same case dimensions and screen size and resolution as the previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Karoo 2</a>, but there’s a wholesale upgrade to the Karoo’s internals, with a faster 2.0GHz processor, 64GB memory in place of 32GB and multi-band GNSS support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, Hammerhead has at the same time increased battery life from a claimed eight hours for the Karoo 2 to what’s now said to be over 15 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first major upgrade since Hammerhead was acquired by SRAM, and it has been co-developed with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-red-axs-2024\" target=\"_blank\">the brand’s new Red AXS groupset</a> to offer closer integration – you can configure SRAM groupset behaviour in the Karoo, instead of using the AXS smartphone app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hammerhead Karoo is priced at £449.99 / $474.99 / €499.99 / AU$749.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-red-axs-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS reclaims lightest groupset mantle and updates ergonomics</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS groupset review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zipp-vector-r-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">Zipp ups integration with SL 80 Race bar and Goodyear-made Vector R tyres</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Upgraded internals</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"856\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-970x856.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-970x856.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-300x265.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-768x677.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-1536x1355.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-2048x1806.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-750x662.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-5-1140x1005.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammerhead’s screen resolution was already significantly greater than its competitors, with the 3.2 inch colour touchscreen boasting a 480×800 pixel resolution. In contrast, among its competitors the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/garmin-edge-1040-solar-gps-bike-computer-review\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin Edge 1040</a> has a 3.5 inch touchscreen with 282 x 470 pixels and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-elemnt-roam-review\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Elemnt Roam</a> has a 2.7 inch non-touch screen with 240×400 pixels resolution.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgrades to the Karoo’s internals include a new quad core 2.0GHz processor, up from the previous generation Karoo 2’s 1.1GHz. The internal memory size has doubled from 32GB to 64GB and there’s 4GB of RAM, again double that of the Karoo 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammerhead has added new multi-band GNSS support to the Karoo, which is also a feature of the latest generation of Garmin and Wahoo cycling computers and should provide a more accurate position fix, particularly under tree cover or when riding between tall buildings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably due to the high res screen and Android-based internals, the Karoo 2’s battery life lagged behind that offered by its competitors, with a claimed eight hours. The new Karoo improves significantly on that with a claimed 15+ hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still a little lower than Wahoo’s claimed 17 hours and significantly less than the Garmin Edge 1040’s claimed 35 hours without the solar charging option and 45 hours with solar charging. It’s nevertheless a significant upgrade that makes multiple rides between charges or longer outings a more practical proposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammerhead says that you can recharge the battery by 30 percent in 30 minutes, with a full charge taking 2.5 hours, using USB-C charging. Despite the upgraded specs, Hammerhead quotes a reduced weight of 118g for the new Karoo versus 131g for the Karoo 2. The new unit retains the IP67 ingress rating of its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-2-review\">Hammerhead Karoo 2 review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\">Complete guide to SRAM road and gravel groupsets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\">Best cycling indoor training apps to make you a better cyclist in 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\">Best bike computers with GPS 2024 for training, navigation and data reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>New functionality and a new companion smartphone app</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-970x644.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-970x644.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-1140x757.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-6-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammerhead has increased the new Karoo’s integration with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM AXS</a> gearing. The Karoo now provides the functionality to configure AXS groupsets, so that you don’t need to use the AXS companion app, while it continues to offer BLE and ANT+ connectivity, so you can hook up HRMs, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">power meters</a> and more. You can also configure your AXS shifters to control the Karoo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spat with Shimano still means that there’s no native support for Di2 connectivity in the Karoo, although there are work-arounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s support for rearview radar and lights carried over from the Karoo 2. Hammerhead has also added greater connectivity to electric bikes, so you can monitor battery level, motor output, range estimates and other stats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features carried over from its predecessor include on-the-fly climb profiles and free global maps and there’s Wi-Fi uploading at the end of a ride. Hammerhead will continue its practice of providing regular software updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New smartphone app</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammerhead’s smartphone companion app used to simply pass data through to its web dashboard, but there’s a new companion app that provides increased functionality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can, for example, now send a pin from Google Maps or Apple Maps to the app, allowing you to navigate to a location and you can also use the companion app to send a ride or workout file to the Karoo from your phone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existing Karoo 2 users will automatically be sent an invitation to install the upgraded companion app on their phones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ride dashboard and data management and analysis functionality remain features of the web app only though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammerhead has increased its support for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/turbo-trainer-workouts-to-improve-your-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">structured workouts</a> in the new Karoo, with a forward view of upcoming intervals during a workout. You can see how well you’re following an interval session while your workout is in progress and there’s now integration with TrainingPeaks and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trainerroad-training-software-review\" target=\"_blank\">TrainerRoad</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An upgraded out-front mount</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-970x642.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-970x642.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-2048x1356.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-750x497.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-1140x755.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Hammerhead-Karoo-2024-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Hammerhead has upgraded the Karoo’s mounting system, although it retains compatibility with the previous generation mount. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new plastic mount allows you to move the Karoo closer to or further in front of your bars and also to install a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/action-camera-round-up\" target=\"_blank\">GoPro</a> or light below the computer, using a separately sold adapter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mount comes in the box with the Karoo, along with an adapter allowing you to use a quarter turn mount. Third party mounting hardware is also available, with K-Edge offering a range of Hammerhead-compatible alloy mounts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgrade to the Karoo has been accompanied by a price increase, with the new Karoo priced at £449.99 / $474.99 / €499.99 / AU$749.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\" target=\"_blank\">best bike computers with GPS</a> for more navigation and training options.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-red-axs-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS reclaims lightest groupset mantle and updates ergonomics</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS groupset review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zipp-vector-r-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">Zipp ups integration with SL 80 Race bar and Goodyear-made Vector R tyres</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\">Hammerhead Karoo 3 has new internals and over 15 hours battery life</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"05f47c03cc2b2886984206f13cc4de727cad9a807e80435b41002626c12bfaa4","category":"Cycling"}
