Going wireless ensures that you don't get tangled up in your cord or have to deal with cable drag, and wireless connections have become so reliable that even gaming companies are offering wireless mice with no real lag issues.</p>\n<p>The situation is a bit more complicated for people using multiple devices. Bluetooth connections may be stable, but that doesn't mean I want to pair and re-pair my mouse repeatedly. Sometimes, being able to just plug in a mouse seems easier.</p>\n<p>But there's another way. The Razer Pro Click Mini joins a selection of wireless mice that let you pair with three Bluetooth devices and pick which machine you're controlling with the press of a button. You can add yet another PC to the mix by using its included wireless dongle, for a total of four connected devices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809644#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809644&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58af4aa152cb6f44841531dbc9cc6db7186771e8fcc972075d68839e36a0459f","category":"Tech"}
