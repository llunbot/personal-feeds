Apple now has an 86 percent market share among teen smartwatch owners. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRolex was previously the reigning most popular watch brand among upper-income teens, but Apple is now the most popular watch brand in this demographic. In the spring of this year, only 13 percent of teens intended to buy an Apple Watch, but this has now increased slightly to 15 percent.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe survey also showed that 30 percent of teens use a fitness app when working out, and 50 percent of these users use an Apple app. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> are owned by 67 percent of teens.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n87 percent of teens own an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and 88 percent expect their next smartphone to be an ‌iPhone‌. These are almost record-high levels. 20 percent of teens currently own an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> model, but the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup is expected to motivate upgrades and more than 22 percent of teens expect to upgrade to an ‌iPhone 13‌ model this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> is the second most popular payment method among teens, but cash is still the most popular. This means that ‌Apple Pay‌ is now more popular than the likes of prepaid cards and PayPal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAround half of the teenagers in the U.S. are concerned about being tracked online, but 56 percent are not interested in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>+, which offers privacy features such as Hide My Email and ‌iCloud‌ Private relay.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe findings are part of Piper Sandler's semi-annual \"Taking Stock With Teens\" survey, which highlights the trends and brand preferences from 10,000 teens with an average age of 15.8 years across 44 U.S. states, and research cited in an investor note <a href=\"https://www.ped30.com/2021/10/05/piper-teen-survey-apple-watch/\">seen by <em>Apple 3.0</em></a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/piper-jaffray/\">Piper Jaffray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teen-survey/\">teen survey</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/apple-now-most-popular-watch-brand-among-teens/\">Apple Now Most Popular Watch Brand Among Upper-Income U.S. Teens, Unseating Rolex</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-most-popular-watch-brand-among-upper-income-u-s-teens-unseating-rolex.2315495/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V434TygIEK0:XwZB-3QCvds:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V434TygIEK0:XwZB-3QCvds:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/V434TygIEK0\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5e838083718790086bcbba48d120d7f7a75ee6d351f2d52d501987306b847af0","category":"Apple"}
