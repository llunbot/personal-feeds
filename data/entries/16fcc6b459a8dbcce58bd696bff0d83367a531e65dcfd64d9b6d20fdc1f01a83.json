That's $30 off Apple's MSRP even though the 10.2-inch tablet doesn't technically release until September 24. Note that you may have to wait a few extra days for the device to ship if you go this route instead of buying directly from Apple, but we figured this deal was worth highlighting for those willing to accept that trade-off in order to save a bit of cash.</p>\n<p>We posted <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-329-ipad-review-the-good-enough-ipad-gets-a-little-better/\" target=\"_blank\">our review of the latest entry-level iPad</a> earlier on Wednesday, deeming it \"still the one most people should buy.\" To be clear, its larger bezels, lack of lamination and antireflective coating on the screen, and slower Lightning port certainly show their age next to the more modern design language of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/2021-ipad-pro-review-more-of-the-same-but-way-way-faster-thanks-to-m1/\" target=\"_blank\">the iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/ipad-air-2020-review-semi-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Air</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/the-more-pricey-2021-ipad-mini-is-the-best-one-apple-has-ever-made/\" target=\"_blank\">just-refreshed iPad mini</a>. But the ninth-generation iPad still offers sturdy hardware, an otherwise pleasant display, and more-than-good-enough performance for web browsing, video streaming, mobile gaming, and lighter work. That's in addition to the usual rich app library and long-term software support that comes with owning an iOS device.</p>\n<p>If you already own a relatively recent model, there's no pressing need to upgrade here, but this year's iteration does double the base storage (now with 64GB) and an upgraded A13 Bionic chip (giving it performance roughly comparable to 2019's iPhone 11 series). The front-facing camera has been modestly improved to a 12MP wide-angle camera that may be preferable for group video calls, and there's now support for Apple's True Tone display tech, which shifts the display's color temperature to match the ambient lighting of your surroundings. The whole thing can still be upgraded into a slightly more work-friendly machine with the help of a keyboard case or Apple's (first-gen) Pencil stylus as well.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796667#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796667&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"16fcc6b459a8dbcce58bd696bff0d83367a531e65dcfd64d9b6d20fdc1f01a83","category":"Tech"}
