{"title":"MacOS Security Prompts Need a Rethinking","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/11/a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-permissions-requests/","date":1701308256000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last month I wrote about how Apple’s cascade of macOS alerts and \nwarnings <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2023/10/apple-is-destroying-the-mac-by-trying-to-make-it-safer/\">ruin the Mac upgrade experience</a>. [...] </p>\n\n<p>This issue was brought home to me last week when I was reviewing \n<a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/11/m3-imac-review-keep-playing-the-hits/\">the M3 iMac</a> and the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/11/m3-macbook-pro-review-peak-performance/\">M3 MacBook Pro</a>. As a part of \nreviewing those computers, I used Migration Assistant to move a \nbackup of my Mac Studio to the new systems via a USB drive. \nSometimes I try to review a computer with nothing migrated over, \nbut it can be a real slowdown and I didn’t really have any time to \nspare last week. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, by migrating, I got to (twice) experience Apple’s ideal \nprocess of moving every user from one Mac to the next. You start \nup your new computer, migrate from a backup of the old computer, \nand then start using the new one. There’s a lot that’s great about \nthis process, and it’s so much better than what we used to have to \ndo to move files over from one Mac to another. </p>\n\n<p>And yet all of Apple’s security alerts got in the way again and \nspoiled the whole thing. Here’s a screenshot I took right after my \nnew Mac booted for the first time after migration. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I went through the exact same thing. Except if I had taken a screenshot of all the security-permission alerts I had to go though, there would have been <em>more</em> of them — and Snell’s screenshot looks like a parody. Back in the heyday of the “Get a Mac” TV ad campaign, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuqZ8AqmLPY\">Apple justifiably lambasted Windows Vista</a> for its security prompts, but that’s exactly the experience you get after running Migration Assistant on a Mac today. It’s terrible.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t get me wrong: Migration Assistant is borderline miraculous. It’s a wonderful tool that seemingly just keeps getting better. But MacOS itself stores too many security/privacy settings in a way that are tied to the device, not your user account. There ought to be some way to OK all these things in one fell swoop.</p>\n\n<p>As Snell says, setting up a new Mac should be a joy, not a chore. Migration Assistant takes care of so much, but these cursed security prompts spoil the experience.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/29/snell-macos-security\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dcee37980af56e8aa6dc3271bd1a7bedd0ec8c2a4be5feeca52e206e418b4581","category":"Tech"}
