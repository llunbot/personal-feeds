One minute you’re covering every radiator with wet clothes and wearing a base layer to bed, the next, you’re trotting out Giro predictions, slathering factor 50 on in the Peak District (of all places), watching Coventry concede 123<sup>rd</sup> minute heart-breakers in the playoff semi-final and panicking about your summer riding plans.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other things you probably wouldn’t want sneaking up on you in a dark Peak District alley are Ian Botham and Bradley Wiggins – so I’m giving you fair warning that they are on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bradley-wiggins-ian-botham-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast</a> that you can listen to right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is racing galore on the site right now.

It’s very Instagram friendly and logo-heavy, with a wide variety of chalky pastels, off-beat camouflage patterns and block colours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those who are interested in moving away from the black-only bib short manifesto, Hypersupp offers ample options there, with grey, green, rose, coral and even white for the very brave. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-970x647.webp\" alt=\"green shorts on ginger man from behind\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictured here are the Men’s Performance Supp Bib Shorts in dark green, the Men’s Supp Jersey in Lagoon Green and the Men’s Universality Lightweight Gilet in Pink Apricot. The jersey and bibs are recommended for riding in warm temperatures and I can believe it, as the material is thin and breathable. This also contributes to light weights, with the bibs coming in at under 200g in size large. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fit definitely errs on the performance side, with quite a short body and some gapping between bib short and jersey. This seems to be intentional as it’s shown on the website model shots too. This wasn’t a problem when on the bike but it might not be to everyone’s choosing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-970x647.webp\" alt=\"black cycling gloves with hands on bars and green shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/hyper-supp-4-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypersupp doesn’t use grippers or a thick band on the legs of the bibs, instead opting for a thin tightened band of material that keeps the bibs in place for the most part. I paired this kit with the Men’s Universality Sleeveless Base Layer and the Universality white socks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypersupp is clearly trying to bring a competitively priced alternative to the market, which leans into the same kinds of branding that is becoming more prevalent out on the road. There’s a lot to like here, though I’m not sure I can count myself a so-called ‘Hyper Rider’ just yet. Sounds a bit tiring. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://hypersupp.com/collections/category_bib_shorts/Male\" target=\"_blank\">Hypersupp ($173.75 bibs)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thule Yepp 2 Maxi </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"666\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-970x666.webp\" alt=\"thule child seat from side\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-970x666.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-300x206.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-768x528.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-1536x1055.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-2048x1407.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-750x515.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-1-1140x783.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Laurence Kilpatrick</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before my daughter was even born, I started getting excited about how I would shoehorn her into my bike riding routines. On the day the Giro climbed the Passo Santa Barbara in Trento, circa 2023, my friend and I climbed past a man who’d clearly just towed his child in a wheeled trailer up the brutish 13km climb without a battery in sight. Whoever you were signore, chapeau. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Thule Yepp 2 Maxi probably isn’t quite <em>hors catégorie</em> ready, but boy has it transformed the nursery run. As any stubborn goat worth their salt will tell you, instructions are only to be consulted once you’ve spun yourself into a furious rage at your own inability to set something up blind. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-970x648.webp\" alt=\"thule child seat from the back\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-970x648.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-1536x1026.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-2048x1368.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-750x501.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-1140x762.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Laurence Kilpatrick</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out, the Yepp has been designed so intuitively, I only got them out to double check everything had indeed been done correctly. Just clamp the main foundation onto the seat tube, and then – once you’ve got the bars locked into the seat – slot the whole thing together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your baby / toddler can then be securely lashed to the chair, with everything more adjustable and comfortable than any car seat we’ve ever used, including leg stirrups that can be lowered as growth spurts occur. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-970x648.webp\" alt=\"thule child seat adjustment\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-970x648.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-1536x1026.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-2048x1368.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-750x501.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-1140x762.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/thule-kids-seat-3-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Laurence Kilpatrick</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main drawback now seems to be that said toddler doesn’t actually want to travel by any other method. Sometimes I have to just let her wear the helmet in the pram by way of a compromise for not getting the bike out. She hasn’t asked me to haul her up Great Dun Fell or Hardknott Pass yet, but I’m sure it’s only a matter of time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a

there who don’t find quite enough diversion in the chirruping of birds or occasional roar of motorised vehicles, and instead choose to use earphones while they ride, then the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are a whole lot of headphone in a very small package. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Bluetooth connectivity, 8.5 hours of battery life (plus another 2.5 charges in the carrying case), nine combinations of ear tips, IPX4 water resistance and touch sensitive controls, these Bose headphones have all of the features you’d expect from a wireless headphone – plus a few more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They feature a setting called Aware Mode, which allows users to hear ambient noises, in addition to their media, effectively lessening the noise cancelling qualities temporarily. Alternatively, Quiet Mode amps up the noise cancellation, making it seem like you really are cocooned in your sounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I prefer this solution to the recent trend for bone-conduction headphones, which often feel like a quiet speaker trying and failing to shoot sounds into your ear from a distance. It’s even worse when it’s windy or you’re riding particularly quickly.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I’ve discovered to my cost, if I use non-wired headphones, they need to be a bright colour. I’ve lost too many minutes peering down at grey tarmac squinting to see a dropped black headphone to make the same mistake again. The White Smoke colour does the job nicely and matches my helmet of course. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.co.uk%2Fen_gb%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fearbuds%2Fbose-quietcomfort-earbuds.html%23v%3DQCEARB24-HEADPHONEIN-TWBL-WW\" target=\"_blank\">Bose (£179.95) </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: The Peak District </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-scaled.webp 1920w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/lk-peak-district-1-1140x1520.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Laurence Kilpatrick</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, it’s delightful to visit the continent and take in the myriad roads and incredible cols it has in spades, but far closer to home – weather permitting – and the riding is spectacular in a different way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a top secret mission, me and one of Cyclist’s elite photographers drove up to the Peak District to tick off a few of the areas most memorable passes. Flexibility was baked into the trip, but as it turned out, we rode into the midriff of a May heatwave and caught these climbs at their absolute best. Personally, I think they look pretty naughty when cloaked in moody fog and spatterings of rain, but that sometimes doesn’t translate so well to the old camera. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some help from the lovely people at <a href=\"https://darwinforest.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Darwin Forest Lodges</a>, who put us up for a couple of nights in the epicentre of the hills. It was a perfect spot to access a range of different climbs, and you can ride straight out of the front door into winding lanes and a lot of double digit climbing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the riding was done for the day, we kicked back in the on-site sauna and spa, chewing the fat with other holiday makers and riders, before retiring to a blissfully silent abode. With cabins that can house up to eight people – some featuring hot tubs! – it’s an ideal base for a group cycling trip that’s very close to your doorstep – or closer than Mallorca at least. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'tasty morsels sent straight to your inbox, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hypersupp-cycling-kit\">In the Drops: Trendy Hypersupp kit, Thule child seat, Bose earbuds and the Peak District</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"29ad40bd389d514c390e26756cda75c5a4dec88a6f38c0fa63ecbd7c132f49c1","category":"Cycling"}
