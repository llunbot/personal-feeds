Lastly, you can now also apply data filters which determine which database and tables get automatically replicated. Read this <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-rds-for-mysql-zero-etl-integration-with-amazon-redshift-now-generally-available-enables-near-real-time-analytics/\">blog post where I review aspects of this release and show you how to get started with data filtering</a> if you want to know more. Incidentally, this release pairs well with another release this week: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-redshift-altering-sort-keys-tables-zero-etl-integration/\">Amazon Redshift now allows you to alter the sort keys of tables replicated via zero-ETL integrations</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Oracle Database@AWS</strong> has been announced as part of a strategic partnership between <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/aws/2024/9/oracle-and-amazon-web-services-announce-strategic-partnership\">Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Oracle</a>. This offering allows customers to access Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Exadata Database Service directly within AWS simplifying cloud migration for enterprise workloads. Key features include zero-ETL integration between Oracle and AWS services for real-time data analysis, enhanced security, and optimized performance for hybrid cloud environments. This collaboration addresses the growing demand for multi-cloud flexibility and efficiency. It will be available in preview later in the year with broader availability in 2025 as it expands to new Regions.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service now supports version 2.15</strong>, featuring improvements in search performance, query optimization, and AI-powered application capabilities. Key updates include radial search for vector space queries, optimizations for neural sparse and hybrid search, and the ability to enable vector and hybrid search on existing indexes. Additionally, it also introduces new features like a toxicity detection guardrail and an ML inference processor for enriching ingest pipelines. Read this guide to see how you can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/version-migration.html\">upgrade your Amazon OpenSearch Service domain</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>So simple yet so good</strong></span><br /> These releases are simple in nature, but have a big impact.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) now supports AWS PrivateLink – </strong>With this release, you can now securely share resources across AWS accounts with private connectivity, without exposing traffic to the public internet. This integration allows for more secure and streamlined access to shared services via VPC endpoints, improving network security and simplifying resource sharing across organizations.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Network Firewall now supports AWS PrivateLink – </strong>another security quick-win, you can now securely access and manage Network Firewall resources without exposing traffic to the public internet.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS IAM Identity Center now enables users to customize their experience – </strong>You can set the language and visual mode preferences, including dark mode for improved readability and reduced eye strain. This update supports 12 different languages and enables users to adjust their settings for a more personalized experience when accessing AWS resources through the portal​.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Others<br /> </strong></span><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-eventbridge-pipes-customer-managed-keys/\">Amazon EventBridge Pipes now supports customer managed KMS keys</a> – </strong>Amazon EventBridge Pipes now supports customer-managed keys for server-side encryption. This update allows customers to use their own AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys to encrypt data when transferring between sources and targets, offering more control and security over sensitive event data. The feature enhances security for point-to-point integrations without the need for custom integration code. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-encryption-pipes-cmkey.html\">See instructions on how to configure this</a> in the updated documentation. <span><strong><br /> </strong></span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/aws-glue-data-catalog-optimization-apache-iceberg-tables/\"><strong>AWS Glue Data Catalog now supports enhanced storage optimization for Apache Iceberg tables</strong></a> – This includes automatic removal of unnecessary data files, orphan file management, and snapshot retention. These optimizations help reduce storage costs and improve query performance by continuously monitoring and compacting tables, making it easier to manage large-scale datasets stored in Amazon S3. See this Big Data blog post for a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/the-aws-glue-data-catalog-now-supports-storage-optimization-of-apache-iceberg-tables/\">deep dive into this new feature</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/amazon-msk-cross-cluster-replication-identical-topic-names/\">Amazon MSK Replicator now supports the replication of Kafka topics across clusters while preserving identical topic names</a> – </strong>This simplifies cross-cluster replication processes allowing users to replicate data across regions without needing to reconfigure client applications. This reduces setup complexity and enhances support for more seamless failovers in multi-cluster streaming architectures​. See this <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-replicator.html\">Amazon MSK Replicator developer guide</a> to learn more about it.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/sticky-session-routing-amazon-sagemaker-inference/\">Amazon SageMaker introduces sticky session routing for inference</a> – </strong>This allows requests from the same client to be directed to the same model instance for the duration of a session improving consistency and reducing latency, particularly in real-time inference scenarios like chatbots or recommendation systems, where session-based interactions are crucial​. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/stateful-sessions.html\">Read about how to configure it</a> in this documentation guide.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Events</strong></span><br /> The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/startups/lp/aws-gen-ai-lofts\">AWS GenAI Lofts</a> continue to pop up around the world!
