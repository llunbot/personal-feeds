However, the technology has been around for a while now—two researchers were critical to its development in 2020—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/gene-editing-tool-gets-its-inevitable-nobel/\">and there have been only a few cases</a> where gene editing has been used to target diseases.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons for that is the challenge of targeting specific cells in a living organism. Many genetic diseases affect only a specific cell type, such as red blood cells in sickle-cell anemia, or specific tissue. Ideally, to limit potential side effects, we'd like to ensure that enough of the editing takes place in the affected tissue to have an impact, while minimizing editing elsewhere to limit side effects. But our ability to do so has been limited. Plus, a lot of the cells affected by genetic diseases are mature and have stopped dividing. So, we either need to repeat the gene editing treatments indefinitely or find a way to target the stem cell population that produces the mature cells.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, a US-based research team said that they've done gene editing experiments that targeted a high-profile genetic disease: cystic fibrosis. Their technique largely targets the tissue most affected by the disease (the lung), and occurs in the stem cell populations that produce mature lung cells, ensuring that the effect is stable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031527#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031527&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4876128d2431ad7bc2bc9df18d83668e71a030e548512cfc1b5d77ab10ba783b","category":"Tech"}
