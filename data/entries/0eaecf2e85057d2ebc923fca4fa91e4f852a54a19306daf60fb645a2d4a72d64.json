It’s a big day full of new features and capabilities!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you can’t update to the latest today, or you don’t want to make the move yet, you don’t want to miss out on all the security fixes that come along with it. That’s why Apple released iOS 17.7 and iPadOS 17.7 today as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updates come with <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121246\">16 security updates</a>, some of which appear to be rather important. You should probably update right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While iOS 18 supports all the same iPhones as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> did, the same is not true of iPadOS 18. If you have a 2nd generation iPad Pro (2017, 12.9 and 10.5 inch) or 6th generation iPad (2018), you can’t update to iPadOS 18, so this security update is especially important for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your device, open <em>Settings</em>, tap <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0eaecf2e85057d2ebc923fca4fa91e4f852a54a19306daf60fb645a2d4a72d64","category":"Apple"}
