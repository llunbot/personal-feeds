Both M4 MacBook Air models are\npriced $100 less than their predecessors: $1199 for the 15-inch\nmodel and $999 for the 13-incher. If I’m not mistaken, this is the\nfirst time that the new-generation design of MacBook Air\nintroduced with the M2 chip has been available at the classic $999\nprice at launch. (The M1 Air, based on the Intel-era visual\ndesign, debuted at $999, but the M2 Air debuted at $1199 and only\nreached $999 when it was offered as an older model alongside the\nM3 Air.) As of now, the M4 Air can hold down the sub-$1000 price\npoint all on its own, and previous models are mostly discontinued.</p>\n\n<p>Another surprise is the the new color option: Space Gray is out.\nThe ultra-dark-blue Midnight remains, as do the classic Silver and\nhint-of-champagne Starlight. The new color is Sky Blue, which\napparently is a metallic light blue that really shows itself as a\ncolor gradient when viewed at various angles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Very cool that the new M4 starts at $999. Each successive generation of Apple Silicon, at least in laptops, is getting more and more predictably regular.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/apple-announces-with-little-surprise-m4-macbook-airs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"54b2fb00dd2125962b8348e826959d7a609c77553c34fb80957b4a7c75aaa148","category":"Tech"}
