The Stelvio, the Gavia, and the Mortirolo all stack up in the Italian Alps like murderer’s row, and all rightly deserve their legendary status.</p>\n<p>The Poggio? Meh, at 4 kilometers long with an average gradient of 3.7 percent, it’s not even a climb, at least not by WorldTour standards.</p>\n<p>Yet that rather anonymous strip of asphalt laid in among homes, a few greenhouses, and a bar at the top delivers one of cycling’s most thrilling and decisive moments every spring at the sharp end of Milan-San Remo.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/will-the-2024-tour-de-france-see-another-time-trial-reversal/\" target=\"_blank\">Will the 2024 Tour de France see another time trial reversal?</a></p>\n<p>The Poggio, by sheer coincidence, becomes the decider in one of men’s cycling’s famed five monuments.</p>\n<p>The otherwise generic ramp that doesn’t require a top amateur to shift out of the big ring is immediately associated with some of the biggest names in cycling history. Eddy Merckx won over it. Sean Kelly ruled it.

Milan-San Remo is one race that’s fine just the way it is.</p>\n<p>Some believe that if Milan-San Remo is harder it would be more interesting. And in most cases in bike racing, that’s largely true, but not for La Primavera.</p>\n<p>It’s a unique race that is almost perfect just the way it is.</p>\n<p>Most races have been forced to adapt to modern cycling’s demands, and there’s been a steady march toward harder, shorter, faster across stage racing. Add gravel, mega-short stages of 90km, and an endless parade of punchy climbs, grand tour riding in the 2020s looks very different than it did even at the turn of the century.</p>\n<p>Yet San Remo stands eternal.</p>\n<p>At 294km, it is the longest men’s race on the WorldTour. It’s often called the easiest to race, but the hardest to win. And therein lies its beautiful charm.</p>\n<p>The long distance and its early season date make it a challenging puzzle to unravel. All the top riders want to win it, and as the peloton goes ever faster on a course that never changes, sprinters have a harder time winning for what for decades was called the sprinter’s classic.</p>\n<p>Once the race clears Passo del Turchino at about the halfway point, things really start to ramp up as the race hits the Mediterranean Coast.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CAuldPhoto-MSR-0164.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><span>The headlines along the Mediterranean Coast lead toward the Poggio.</span> (Photo: Chris Auld/CyclingTips)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The string of headlands along the “capi” on the main coast road open the ever-accelerating peloton to wind and increasingly harder terrain.</p>\n<p>Up first is the Cipressa, a climb included in 1982, another otherwise bland climb that wouldn’t rate on anyone’s Strava ride board if it wasn’t positioned before the Poggio on the way to the Via Roma.</p>\n<p>Racing can be nervous, and there are usually a few pileups, but inevitably all the “bigs” hit the Poggio with everything in play.</p>\n<p>It’s a 10km rollercoaster from there to the finish line. Who can win? The potential winner’s list is longer at San Remo than any race on the calendar. Sprinters, monument men, time trialists, GC riders, and even wild descenders all believe in their chances over the Poggio.</p>\n<p>On 364 days a year, the road is busy with cars, trucks, and hordes of cyclists retracing the Poggio.</p>\n<p>It’s a wonderful ride along the coast. There’s a new bike path along an old railway line that will get you off the heavily trafficked main road almost all the way down to the Cipressa. From there, you can turn onto the race course and hammer out the closing 30km.</p>\n<p>On one magical Saturday every spring, the Poggio plays king-maker and dream-breaker in very quick succession for the peloton’s toughest riders.</p>\n<p>And the magic on the Poggio plays out.</p>\n<p>It’s cycling blandest but most drama-producing climb of the year.</p>","author":"Andrew Hood","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"97c449e27054c8a64846b13b38fbd369bdc0bf25fe6d065f1ea7fdb2226b6dd4","category":"Cycling"}
