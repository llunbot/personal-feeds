The expansion of the changes to the iPad in the EU comes nearly two months after the European Commission said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/\">iPadOS is also a gatekeeper platform</a> under these new regulations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe other changes include alternative payment options in the App Store, a default web browser selection screen in Safari, the ability for web browsers to use web engines other than Apple's WebKit on the iPhone and iPad, and more. Apple's existing terms extend to the iPad, including the Core Technology Fee for alternative app marketplaces.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 18 is currently in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The update should be widely released in September.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/ipados-18-beta-2-includes-eu-changes/\">iPadOS 18 Beta 2 Includes Alternative App Stores and Other EU Changes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-18-beta-2-includes-alternative-app-stores-and-other-eu-changes.2429975/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"976c4c39889c782d055b8c3306e40cc8290a6595fe8846fbc86d43f09523cd79","category":"Apple"}
