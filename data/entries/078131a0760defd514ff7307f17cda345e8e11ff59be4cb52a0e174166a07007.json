The initial launch version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> will not include any Apple Intelligence features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA version of iOS 18.1 available for the ‌iPhone 16‌ models means people who are currently running iOS 18.1 on their ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ will be able to transfer their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> backups when the ‌iPhone 16‌, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max launch next Friday. Transferring data from one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to another requires that both devices run the same version of iOS, which can be a hassle when betas are involved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has likely provided ‌iPhone 16‌ review models to media sites, so the early release of the beta will allow reviewers running iOS 18.1 to set up their test ‌iPhone 16‌ devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ will be released on Monday, but the iOS 18.1 beta testing process will continue on for several more weeks.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/11/ios-18-1-beta-3-iphone-16/\">Apple Releases iOS 18.1 Beta 3 for Upcoming iPhone 16 Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-18-1-beta-3-for-upcoming-iphone-16-models.2435929/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"078131a0760defd514ff7307f17cda345e8e11ff59be4cb52a0e174166a07007","category":"Apple"}
