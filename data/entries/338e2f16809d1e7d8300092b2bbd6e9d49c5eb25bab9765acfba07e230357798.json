On those platforms, Google and Meta simplify the ad-buying process by automatically determining the campaign that best fits a client’s needs after a simple setup process. The new process, Business Insider explains, will let advertisers enter their budget target metrics, audiences, and countries they want to reach. Then Apple’s AI-powered algorithm will decide where best to place ads within the search result, today tab, or app listings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program will reportedly be limited to App Store search results, though it may extend to other apps, including Maps and Sports. According to research firm Omdia, Apple’s ad business is on track to make some $7 billion in revenue this year, up from $6 billion in 2023 and $4 billion in 2022. </p>\n\nMobile Apps</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"338e2f16809d1e7d8300092b2bbd6e9d49c5eb25bab9765acfba07e230357798","category":"Apple"}
