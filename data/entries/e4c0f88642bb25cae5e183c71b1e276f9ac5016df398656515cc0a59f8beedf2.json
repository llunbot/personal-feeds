Globally, agriculture accounts for about 37 percent of methane emissions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009517#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009517&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4c0f88642bb25cae5e183c71b1e276f9ac5016df398656515cc0a59f8beedf2","category":"Tech"}
