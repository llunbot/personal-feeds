Then, if you puncture and the air rushes out of your tire, that pressure drop causes the air trapped inside the foam to expand and partially fill the tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"910\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-1.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria air liner light gravel tire insert shown mounted on a rim.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-1-297x135.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-1-1536x699.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-1-120x55.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-1-768x349.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Vittoria says it’s enough to let you keep riding…for a while, anyway. Unlike XC, where it could be enough for you to finish a lap (or even a complete race), with gravel it could be enough to get you to the next aid station where you can perform a proper fix. Or, if you’re plugging the tire road side, it means you won’t have to mini-pump as much air back into it to get rolling again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria air liner light gravel tire insert shown next to a tire.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-air-liner-light-gravel-tire-insert-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also adds a quasi-suspension effect, helping support the tire at lower pressures and preventing pinch flats.
