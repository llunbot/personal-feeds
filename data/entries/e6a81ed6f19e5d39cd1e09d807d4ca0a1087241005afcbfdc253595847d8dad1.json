It provides secure storage, access control, encryption services, and auditability for sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and cryptographic keys.</p>\n\n<p>Vault authenticates users, applications, and machines, authorizes access through fine-grained policies, and records every operation in a detailed audit log. Access is available via UI, CLI, or API, making Vault suitable for both human and automated workflows.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What is HCP Vault Radar?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>HCP Vault Radar is a secrets scanning, discovery, and exposure detection product that continuously scans environments where secrets are commonly leaked, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Source code repositories</li>\n<li>CI/CD pipelines</li>\n<li>Ticketing systems</li>\n<li>Collaboration and messaging tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vault Radar acts as the detection layer, helping organizations identify when secrets escape approved boundaries. Through its integration with Vault, you can rapidly remediate leaked secrets into secure storage.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What is HCP Boundary?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>HCP Boundary provides users with secure remote access to infrastructure resources including Linux/Windows VMs, databases, Kubernetes clusters, web applications, etc. Users are only able to access resources that they’ve been authorized to connect with, aligning to least-privilege access principles. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to enforcing authorization, Boundary also secures authentication by protecting credentials in sensitive systems using two key features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Credential injection</strong>: When users initiate connections to resources over SSH or RDP, Boundary will automatically inject credentials to authenticate users, resulting in a passwordless access experience. Since credentials are not seen or available to users, they cannot share or risk exposing them to others. </li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic credentials</strong>: Through native integrations with HashiCorp Vault, Boundary can generate just-in-time (JIT) dynamic credentials to infrastructure resources. These dynamic credentials have a short time-to-live (TTL) which reduces the chances of unauthorized access. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Credential injection and dynamic credentials can be used independently, but are a formidable security barrier when coupled together in PCI DSS environments. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Supporting PCI DSS requirements with Vault, Vault Radar, and Boundary</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Together, Vault and Vault Radar, and Boundary support multiple PCI DSS control areas by combining preventative safeguards in combination with continuous detection and response.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Secure secrets and key management</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Vault centralizes the storage and control of credentials, encryption keys, and certificates used across the cardholder data environment (CDE), reducing <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/what-is-secret-sprawl-why-is-it-harmful\">secret sprawl</a> and unauthorized access.</p>\n\n<p>Vault Radar continuously monitors environments outside Vault to detect leaked secrets, helping ensure that sensitive credentials remain centrally managed.</p>\n\n<p>Boundary only provides authorized and privileged users with access to the card holder data environment. Privileged users are restricted from seeing or handling credentials when connecting over SSH or RDP. Access is denied at the network and authentication layer to all other non-privileged users.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Encryption and cryptographic controls</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Vault provides <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/encryption-as-a-service\">encryption-as-a-service</a> and manages keys used to protect data at rest and in transit, supporting PCI requirements for strong cryptography and secure key lifecycles.</p>\n\n<p>Vault Radar helps ensure that cryptographic material and access credentials are not inadvertently exposed in code or collaboration platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Boundary encrypts user traffic, ensuring all network traffic through Boundary components are secure and protected from malicious entities.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Dynamic secrets and automated rotation</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Vault can generate credentials on demand and automatically rotate them, minimizing the risk of long-lived or compromised secrets.</p>\n\n<p>When Vault Radar detects exposed secrets, organizations can use Vault to immediately revoke and rotate credentials, limiting blast radius and supporting incident response requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Boundary integrates with many of Vault’s secret engines to generate dynamic short-lived credentials for user access, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if exposed.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advanced data protection</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Vault’s <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/transform\">Transform secrets engine</a> supports:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data masking</li>\n<li>Format-preserving encryption (FF3-1)</li>\n<li>Tokenization</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/how-to-choose-a-data-protection-method\">These capabilities</a> can reduce PCI scope by limiting exposure of cardholder data while preserving application compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>Vault Radar reinforces scope reduction by identifying uncontrolled access paths that could unintentionally expand PCI scope.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Secure software development</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Vault enables applications to retrieve secrets securely at runtime, eliminating the need to hard-code credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Vault Radar scans source code, pull requests, CI/CD pipelines, and IDEs to detect hard-coded secrets and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIKd8nhEUVI\">prevent them from being published</a> in version control.</p>\n\n<p>Boundary ensures that developers can safely and securely connect to infrastructure resources and common desktop environments used to run their applications, including Linux and Windows servers, databases, etc.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Access control and auditability</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Vault enforces least-privilege access using role-based access control (RBAC) policies tied to identity, not IP addresses. It also records all access in tamper-evident audit logs, supporting PCI audit trail requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Vault Radar provides additional investigative context by identifying where and when secrets were exposed, supporting forensic analysis alongside Vault audit logs.</p>\n\n<p>Boundary uses identity-based <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rbac\">RBAC</a> for users and groups to control access to each infrastructure resource in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment\">CDE</a>. Boundary also provides extensive audit data and logs of user and administrative access to meet compliance.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Observability and continuous monitoring (Requirement 11)</strong></h3>\n\n<p>PCI DSS Requirement 11 emphasizes the importance of <em>regular testing and monitoring of security systems</em> to detect vulnerabilities, anomalous behavior, and unauthorized access.</p>\n\n<p>Vault Radar directly supports this requirement by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Continuously monitoring for secrets exposure outside of Vault</li>\n<li>Alerting security teams to potential security events or misconfigurations</li>\n<li>Providing dashboards and reporting for visibility and audit evidence</li>\n<li>Enabling proactive responses and remediation to reduce risk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This observability ensures organizations can detect and respond to risks in real time, an essential part of PCI DSS compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Boundary supports SSH session recording and playback showing detailed user actions, commands, and activity. The recordings facilitate analysis, remediation, and response in the event of unauthorized access.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Mapping Vault,Vault Radar, and Boundary to PCI DSS 4.0.1 Requirements</strong></h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>PCI DSS 4.0.1 Requirement</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>HashiCorp Vault</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>HCP Vault Radar</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>HCP Boundary</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Req. 1 – Network security controls</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>Out of scope for system configuration management.\n   </td>\n   <td>Out of scope for system configuration management.\n   </td>\n   <td>Limits broad user access across networks.\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Req. 2 – Secure configurations</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>Enforces secure access to secrets using identity-based authentication, policy controls, and trusted auth sources.
