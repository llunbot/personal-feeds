A week after <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-2024-olympics-road-race\" target=\"_blank\">time-trialling his way to victory</a> on treacherous wet roads ahead of Filippo Ganna (Italy) and fellow countryman Wout van Aert, he was back in action for the men’s road race. He lived up to the hype and then some. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After bridging across to the leading group he immediately began to drop riders, with Valentin Madouas of France the last man standing. Evenepoel surged away on the penultimate climb and embarked on a 15km solo ride to the finish line. However, it wasn’t without some late dramatics.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last kilometres with the gold medal practically already around his neck, a puncture left Evenepoel screaming for a new bike. No race radios meant he had no idea of Madouas’s position on the road. The camera motorbike couldn’t help him either. Eventually he was relayed the information that Madouas was a minute down and Evenepoel could provide the public with a touch of dramatic flair at the finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Track cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Harrie Lavreysen is the fastest man on two wheels</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Harrie-Lavreysen-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>@UCI_Track</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch sprinter Harrie Lavreysen successfully defended his sprint and team sprint gold medals from Tokyo at the Paris Olympics, even going one better and adding the keirin to his palmarès. The 27-year-old headed into these Games as one to watch, bolstered by his multiple World and European Championships titles in both the sprint and team sprint.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In qualifying for the sprint, he set a new world record of 9.088secs, and in the final won the first two races against Australia’s Matthew Richardson for the gold medal. The Netherlands team set a new Olympic record in qualifying, their three riders of Lavreysen, Roy van den Berg and Deffrey Hoogland hitting a time of 41.279secs over the three laps. They pushed this even further in the gold medal matchup against Great Britain’s Jack Carlin, Ed Lowe and Hamish Turnbull, setting a new world record of 40.949secs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a messy finale for the men’s keirin. A crash in the final corner took down Carlin (Great Britain) and Shinji Nakano (Japan), with Muhammad Shah Firdaus Sahrom (Malaysia) being relegated. Lavreysen was already ahead, his gold medal never in danger, with the Aussie duo of Richardson and Matthew Glaetzer finishing on the podium.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lavreysen was able to dispatch his rivals with ease throughout multiple disciplines in the Olympics. He now has five gold medals and one bronze. Great Britain’s Jason Kenny holds the record for most Olympic golds (seven) and Olympic medals (nine) for a cyclist. It’s hard to sustain such dominance over multiple Olympic cycles, but Lavreysen will only be 31 years of age at the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. He could well be on his way to rivalling Kenny. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Team sprint gold for Great Britain</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Great-Britain-team-sprint-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>@UCI_Track</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Great Britain’s Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane won gold against New Zealand in the women’s team sprint final, setting a new world record of 45.186sec in the process. It was the third WR they had set throughout the event, previously hitting 45.472sec in qualifying and 43.338sec in the first round against Canada. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was Great Britain’s only gold medal on the track. The host nation of France topped cycling’s overall medal table with three golds, three silvers and three bronze medals. Netherlands finished second and Australia third. It’s the first time since the 2004 Athens Olympics that Great Britain has not been at the top of the rankings.

After an early puncture forced him out of the leading duo, Great Britain’s Tom Pidcock worked his way back through to pack over the next half an hour of racing to join Frenchman Victor Koretsky and South Africa’s Alan Hatherly at the head of the race.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koretsky and Pidcock would trade blows, each attacking and swapping places with a gold medal up for grabs. It was on the final part of the course where the trees split the racing lines that would prove the decisive moment. Pidcock went left and just came out in front of Koretsky, who went right, and the duo came together. Pidcock pulled away as Koretsky’s momentum was disrupted. The Brit arrived at the finish line to a chorus of boos from the French crowd, but he successfully defended his Olympic title.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GTlBK3MX0AAI27--350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>UCI MTB</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the women’s race, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot cemented her status as one of the best riders to ever grace the sport.

Andre finished off the podium in fourth at Tokyo.

When the delayed women’s race could eventually get underway, Australia’s Saya Sakakibara won gold. Her partner Mahieu, who had just won bronze, was waiting for her after the finish line.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great Britain’s Beth Shriever couldn’t replicate her success from Tokyo, finishing last in the final, but gave one of the most heartfelt interviews after her 8th place. She said, ‘I’ve loved every single second being here. Sometimes it can’t always go to plan, but that’s just life. I gave my all into this. I’m happy, I’m healthy, I’ve got my friends and family here and that’s what matters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve never experienced anything like [the French 1-2-3]. Insane. I’ve had a great time and it is what it is… it’s all good. I’m happy.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-cycling-moments-2024-paris-olympics\">The best cycling moments from the 2024 Paris Olympics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d9d526f14de345716b46d0c82ed3f329586d91f06d1741ece91a0185563454f4","category":"Cycling"}
