{"title":"Jason Snell Reviews the iPhones 15 Pro","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/review-iphone-15-pro-pro-max/","date":1696890503000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I recently went to a football game (it was a beautiful day in \nBerkeley, California) and was trying to figure out where my wife \nhad gone — we were separately looking for concessions amid the \nrattle and hum of a busy stadium walkway. Then I remembered we \nboth had new iPhone 15 models, and I opened Find My — the app \nthat lets you find all that you can’t leave behind — and enabled \nthe remarkable new UWB-powered feature that lets you find nearby \nfriends. Not only did I almost immediately discover that she was \nto my right (so I began heading that way), but she was also \nnotified that I was looking for her. We found each other and had \nfun doing it! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I neglected to mention this feature in my review, but I tested it, and it really did work as advertised. Almost freakishly accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Snell wraps up his review with a good summary for how much new stuff you can expect to enjoy when upgrading from each successive year of Pro iPhones from the 11 onward.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/snell-iphones-15-pro\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"67c163b6481de37b06a468019de7e20fea0215c0809cedab14bac3ba156637b6","category":"Tech"}
