Both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/\">2016's <em>Doom</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/\">2020's <em>Doom Eternal</em></a> paid homage to both the look and feel of the original <em>Doom</em> titles without being slavishly devoted to older gameplay conventions that can feel dated decades later.</p>\n<p>Yet by the end of <em>Doom Eternal</em>, you could feel the modernized gameplay system threatening to burst at the seams a bit. Managing your limited ammo, health, and armor resources in <em>Eternal</em> meant expertly juggling a bewildering array of chainsaws, flamethrowers, grenades, and melee-based staggers into powerful, pre-animated \"glory kills.\" That was all on top of the frequent weapon-switching needed to take advantage of the weaknesses of the varied enemies surrounding you and the double-jump-and-dash movement system that required expert use of all three dimensions.</p>\n<p>Something had to give. So for <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, the team at id Software has committed to a more streamlined, back-to-basics system that limits complexity while maintaining the same overall difficulty level. That means a \"fewer strings on the guitar\" approach to controls that narrows almost every action down to just three context-sensitive buttons, as the developers discussed in a hands-off virtual preview session attended by Ars Technica.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5636fea25a21049c43e03f8c2656d95f92944c0f63c119f44b8f84cf2496cb6","category":"Tech"}
