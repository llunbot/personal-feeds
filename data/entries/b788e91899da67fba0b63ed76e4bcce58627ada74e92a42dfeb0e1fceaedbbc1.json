As has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/\">already been rumored</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/\">leaked</a>, it now looks almost certain that the next base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip will start with 16GB of RAM too. Given that a vocal contingent of Mac fans have long criticized Apple for including only 8GB of RAM with some Macs, the increased 16GB minimum would be a long-awaited change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond, all higher-end Mac mini configurations with the M4 Pro chip start with 24GB of RAM, and this upgrade will likely extend to the incoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4 Pro chip. The current MacBook Pro models with the M3 Pro chip start with 18GB of RAM, so this would amount to a 6GB increase for the new models. The increased unified memory can benefit multitasking and Apple Intelligence performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to announce the M4 Max, so it is unclear how much RAM that chip will support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of this information will likely be confirmed in less than 24 hours.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/new-mac-mini-hints-at-macbook-pro-ram/\">New Mac Mini Provides Two Clues About RAM in Upcoming MacBook Pros</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-mini-provides-two-clues-about-ram-in-upcoming-macbook-pros.2441327/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b788e91899da67fba0b63ed76e4bcce58627ada74e92a42dfeb0e1fceaedbbc1","category":"Apple"}
