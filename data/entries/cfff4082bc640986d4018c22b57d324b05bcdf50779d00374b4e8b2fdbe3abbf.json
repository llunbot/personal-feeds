{"title":"All of Apple's New Devices Feature the Same Battery Life as Previous Generations","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-devices-feature-same-battery/","date":1694545649000,"content":"All of the new devices Apple today announced at its \"Wonderlust\" event feature no battery life improvements at all compared to their direct predecessors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-color-lineup.jpg\" alt width=\"1960\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nThis comes contrary to a multitude of rumors prior to Apple's event, which suggested that the major efficiency improvements of the S9 and A17 chips would bring battery life improvements. The approximate battery life of each of the new devices Apple unveiled today is as follows:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>Apple Watch Series 9: 18 hours/36 hours in Low Power Mode</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2: 36 hours/72 hours in Low Power Mode</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15: 20 hours</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 26 hours</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 23 hours</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 29 hours</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is exactly the same as the Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Of course, efficiency improvements may still result in slightly better real-world performance in Apple's latest models. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-devices-feature-same-battery/\">All of Apple's New Devices Feature the Same Battery Life as Previous Generations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-of-apples-new-devices-feature-the-same-battery-life-as-previous-generations.2401237/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cfff4082bc640986d4018c22b57d324b05bcdf50779d00374b4e8b2fdbe3abbf","category":"Apple"}
