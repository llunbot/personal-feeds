{"title":"9to5Mac Reports Apple Notes Will Gain Markdown Export at WWDC, and, You’ll Be Unsurprised to Know, I Have Thoughts","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/","date":1749087849000,"content":"\n<p>Marcus Mendes, in a piece at 9to5Mac with multiple spoilers for next week’s keynote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is working on supporting the ability to export notes in\nMarkdown from Apple Notes, which is something third-party apps\nhave supported for years. Granted, this is a niche feature, but as\na fierce participant in the niche, I can confirm: this is huge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When this story first started spreading this morning, it was getting repeated as Notes “gaining Markdown support”, which implied something like <a href=\"https://bear.app/\">Bear</a> or <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a>, where you can type Markdown syntax characters while editing, and perhaps optionally see the Markdown syntax in your notes. “Markdown notes app” is really like a class of notes apps unto itself.</p>\n\n<p>Some people find this surprising, but I personally don’t want to use a Markdown notes app. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown\">I created Markdown two decades ago</a> and have used it ever since for one thing and one thing only: writing for the web at Daring Fireball. My <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">original description</a> of what it is still stands: “Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.” Perhaps an even better description of Markdown is Matthew Butterick’s, <a href=\"https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/quick-tour.html#%28part._.Markdown_mode%29\">from the documentation for Pollen</a>: “Markdown is a simplified notation system for HTML.”</p>\n\n<p>The other great use case for Markdown is in a context where you either <em>need</em> or just <em>want</em> to be saving to a plain text file or database field. That’s not what Apple Notes is or should be. I can see why many technically-minded people want to use Markdown “everywhere”. It’s quite gratifying that Markdown has not only become so popular, but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown\">after 21 years</a>, seemingly continues to grow in popularity, to the point now where there clearly are a lot of people who seemingly enjoy writing in Markdown more than even I do. But I think it would be a huge mistake for Apple to make Apple Notes a “Markdown editor”, even as an option. It’s trivial to create malformed Markdown syntax; it shouldn’t be possible to have a malformed note in Apple Notes. I <em>craft</em> posts for Daring Fireball; I dash off notes in Apple Notes.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Notes offers a great WYSIWYG rich text editing interface that works great on an iPhone and even better on a Mac, which I think is exactly appropriate. Particularly clever are the limited formatting options, where you don’t pick a font per se, but rather only from a set of predefined styles, like headings, lists, and block quote. It’s not nerdy at all. You certainly shouldn’t need to “preview” (let alone keep a separate preview view open side-by-side with your editing view), nor switch between <a href=\"https://www.pavley.com/2020/02/20/no-modes/\">modes</a> for editing and viewing. That’s the Macintosh way. (But that’s why I think Apple Notes’s use of hashtags, rather than real tokenized tags <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/tag-files-and-folders-mchlp15236/mac\">like in the Finder</a>, was an enormous mistake on Apple’s part. Real tokenized tags can contain spaces (so a multi-word tag can just be “Words Written Naturally” not “#WordsCrammedTogether”) and don’t need to be prefixed with an ugly, nerdy-looking <code>#</code> character. Notes using hashtags is like if the Finder disallowed spaces and uppercase letters in filenames.)</p>\n\n<p>But Markdown <em>export</em> from Notes? That sounds awesome. Frankly, perhaps the biggest problem with Apple Notes is that its export functionality is rather crude — <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/export-or-print-notes-iphdf551cfa2/ios\">PDF and, of all formats, Pages</a>. Exporting and/or copying the selected text as Markdown would be pretty cool. Very curious to see how they handle images though, if this rumor is true.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/04/apple-notes-markdown\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e608cd10f1470f7d91c62df39799988007b6b356da8ccea5287e9f92b513e4a","category":"Tech"}
