There’s more integration too, with hidden cables and in-frame storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SmartSense lighting and radar is still an option, but the battery is now housed inside the down tube, the lights are smaller and brighter and all SmartSense bikes include the radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time, there’s a premium carbon LAB71 option for the Synapse, with the LAB71 frame also used for the Synapse Carbon 1 bike. The higher spec frame is claimed to reduce frame weight relative to the standard modulus carbon frame by 150g to under 1,000g. There’s another 50g pared off the fork weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for the five new Synapse Carbon specs available at launch range from $3,500 / €3,499 and top out at $15,800 / €15,799, with UK prices and two further specs to be announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be one of the first to try out the new Synapse, the bike will be available to test ride at Cyclist Track Days on 17th May in London and 7th June in Leeds.

It was the bike used by Lachlan Morton on his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fastest-known-times\">FKT </a>14,200km lap of Australia in 30 days, 9 hours and 59 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Synapse helped to define the endurance category,’ says Andreas Krajewski, Cannondale’s marketing manager for road and gravel. ‘It was raced over the cobbles and it brought real innovation to the table of road riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Now the rules of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">endurance road bikes</a> are being reimagined. From tyre width to integrated technology, tri bars to extreme saddle positions, anything goes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krajewski claims the new Synapse is a bike that can equally be built up light and fast or with lights and bags for long distance travels, pushing the boundaries of what road riding can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'join us and discover the world's best places to ride, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-7-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now more aero</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-728x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-1140x1520.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0012-scaled.webp 1920w\" /><figcaption>Cannondale</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With the new Synapse, Cannondale says it has designed the bike to elevate its performance to the level of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\">SuperSix Evo</a>, while keeping the comfort and accessibility of its endurance platform. That means that, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\">geometry</a>-wise, the new Synapse remains taller and shorter than the SuperSix Evo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also aimed to preserve the family resemblance, with a similar look to the recently launched <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-superx-gravel-bike\">SuperX</a> gravel race bike, in particular, with the skinny mid-section to the seat tube, which Cannondale says has increased compliance at the saddle by 20% over the outgoing model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not as aero as the current SuperSix Evo, Cannondale says that the new Synapse is as fast as that bike’s third generation. It has used similar heavily truncated aerofoil shapes to the SuperSix Evo frame. Rather than an elongated tail, their profile is close to 1:1, which the brand claims allows it to maintain frame <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-frame-stiffness\">stiffness</a>, compliance and low weight while reducing drag by 30% over the last generation bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it isn’t aimed at off-road riding, the 42mm tyre clearance in the frame and 48mm in the fork, up from 35mm in the last Synapse iteration, would allow you to fit chunky tyres for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">all-road riding</a> too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s the full range of mudguard, rack and top tube bag mounts, although there are only the two classic bottle cage mounts.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

resemblance, Cannondale uses similar tech in the new Synapse to its other bikes. As with the last generation Synapse and all Cannondale’s other recent bikes, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bottom-bracket-standards-guide\">BSA bottom bracket</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale has also switched from a round steerer tube to its Delta Steerer, as used in the SuperSix Evo, so there’s internal cabling and the bike is compatible with its full range of stems. That’s allowed it to fit top spec bikes with its SystemBar R-One one-piece carbon bar/stem, also found on higher specs of the SuperSix Evo. The non-round steerer also reduces the head tube’s frontal area for aero benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Synapse uses the same thru-axles, UDH mech hanger and D-shaped seatposts as elsewhere in its range as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More integrated SmartSense 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-970x728.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-2048x1536.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-750x563.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_LAB71_Synapse_Beauty_Light_0007-1140x855.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Cannondale</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most divisive feature of the last generation Synapse was undoubtedly its SmartSense lighting and radar setup, which also found its way onto some specs of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-carbon-2-l-review\">previous generation Topstone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commenting on SmartSense in his review verdict for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\">2022 Synapse</a>, <em>Cyclist</em> tech editor Sam Challis said, ‘I would urge Cannondale to reconsider the application of the SmartSense system. To lighten it, to more seamlessly integrate it, and maybe to not include it as standard on all models.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 500g or so extra weight was a downside, which he reckoned neutered the bike uphill somewhat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale has listened, because SmartSense is an option on the new Synapse and it’s now much better integrated, both in design and functionality, although it hasn’t provided a weight figure for SmartSense 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-970x728.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-2048x1536.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-750x563.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0008-1140x855.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Cannondale</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new Synapse, the SmartSense battery is housed under a hatch in the down tube, so it doesn’t affect the bike’s looks. Cannondale has also reworked the lights and radar, so that they’re less prominent and better integrated. One disadvantage of the greater integration is that you can’t retrofit SmartSense, due to the internal routing. The rear light/radar still gets in the way of a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-saddle-bags\">saddle bag</a> too, although the integrated storage may make this less of an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The battery capacity has doubled, so there’s a 24-hour claimed runtime, while the front light is smaller but brighter, emitting 800 lumens in non-StVZO format or 400 where it’s StVZO compliant. The rear light and radar are now one unit and, unlike the previous generation bike, SmartSense-equipped bikes all come with both the radar and rear light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The battery itself includes an LED, making it easier to see inside the cavity once the hatch is opened.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-970x728.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-2048x1536.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-750x563.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_Synapse_Tech_0010-1140x855.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Cannondale</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the battery in place the new Synapse still provides extra capacity for a toolkit or emergency rations, with Cannondale providing a stash bag to keep items together. It reckons that around two-thirds of the down tube’s internal cavity is available for storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of SRAM-equipped bikes, the battery also powers the derailleurs. Cannondale has engineered the system so that shifting will keep working even if battery capacity is too low to power the lights, so you’re unlikely to end up riding a single-speed. A SmartSense battery with 5% remaining charge still has equivalent capacity to a standard AXS derailleur-mounted battery, Cannondale says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cannondale wheel sensor can be configured to wake SmartSense automatically when it detects that the bike is moving and turn it off at the end of a ride. It forms part of an integrated system with the enhanced Cannondale app, which allows you to configure the system and change lighting patterns, brightness and the flash pattern when a vehicle is detected approaching from behind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app also offers ride tracking, can pair with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-heart-rate-monitors\">heart rate monitor</a> and other devices and can provide data on electric bike systems for Bosch-equipped e-bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale Synapse range and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-970x567.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-970x567.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-300x175.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-768x449.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-1536x898.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-2048x1197.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-750x439.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/C25_C12235U_Synapse_Crb_1_TUB_PD-1140x667.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Cannondale</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cannondale Synapse lineup will eventually include seven bikes, as well as a LAB71 frameset-only option.
