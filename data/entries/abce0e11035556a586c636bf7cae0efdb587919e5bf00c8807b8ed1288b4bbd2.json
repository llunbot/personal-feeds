There is an ‌Apple Intelligence‌ splash screen that comes up after updating, and there is no option other than tapping \"Continue,\" which turns on ‌Apple Intelligence‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you've updated to iOS 18.3.2 and do not want ‌Apple Intelligence‌ enabled, you will need to go the Settings app, tap on ‌Apple Intelligence‌, and then toggle it off. When ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is enabled, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/save-up-to-21gb-storage-disable-apple-intelligence/\">consumes up to 7GB</a> of storage space for local AI models, which is an inconvenience when storage space is limited.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAuto-on for ‌Apple Intelligence‌ was also a problem for some users with the prior iOS 18.3.1 update, and Apple has not changed the setting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-intelligence-re-enabled-in-latest-updates/\">despite complaints</a> after iOS 18.3.1 was released. The issue can also affect iPadOS and macOS users, so make sure to check your ‌Apple Intelligence‌ settings on each device after updating.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/ios-18-3-2-apple-intelligence-auto-on/\">PSA: iOS 18.3.2 Re-Enables Apple Intelligence If You Turned It Off</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-ios-18-3-2-re-enables-apple-intelligence-if-you-turned-it-off.2452829/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"abce0e11035556a586c636bf7cae0efdb587919e5bf00c8807b8ed1288b4bbd2","category":"Apple"}
