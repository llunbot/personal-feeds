Plug your external camera into your iPad's USB-C port either before or during your Teams meeting, and the app will automatically select it for use on the call. To switch back to your iPad's built-in camera, simply disconnect the external one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe plug and play simplicity of the support does mean that there are currently no native or Teams controls to manually switch between your iPad's internal camera and an external one. For now at least, Teams will default to the connected external camera whenever one is plugged in.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicrosoft says most webcams that work over a USB-C connection are supported, so finding a compatible model shouldn't be an issue.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-teams/\">Microsoft Teams</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/microsoft-teams-ipad-external-camera-support/\">Microsoft Teams for iPad Now Includes External Camera Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-teams-for-ipad-now-includes-external-camera-support.2445086/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4576f7d9f4d15c8e4537a252ac059067c45cbeb48a54adeae79a76eebfd646c","category":"Apple"}
