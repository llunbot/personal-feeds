Customers will be able to tap the plus icon at the top of the Wallet app to add their ID, and then simply tap their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch on an identity reader at a TSA checkpoint, without taking out their physical card.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nConfidential documents seen by Mikula and <em>CNBC</em> purportedly reveal that Apple is imposing stringent terms and conditions on U.S. states looking to implement the new feature. The costs of meeting these requirements, such as hiring staff, project management, marketing, and funding, will be charged to the taxpayer with no financial support from Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe company requires states to independently maintain the systems used to issue and service credentials, hire project managers to respond to Apple's inquiries, verify IDs, perform quality testing to ensure that digital IDs meet Apple's requirements, \"prominently\" market the feature, \"proactively\" offer digital IDs whenever a citizen gets a new or replacement card, and encourage state and federal government agencies to widely adopt digital IDs. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has \"sole discretion\" for a number of the program's key aspects, including what devices will be compatible with digital IDs, how states report on the performance of the feature, and its launch date. Apple is also insisting upon the ability to review and approve all state marketing for the feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThese terms were apparently included in a seven-page memorandum of agreement that was signed by Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky, and Oklahoma. According to <em>CNBC</em>, the agreement \"mostly portrays Apple as having a high degree of control over the government agencies responsible for issuing identification cards.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGeorgia and Arizona are set to be the first states to offer citizens the opportunity to add their driver's license to the Wallet app, but have yet to launch the program. <em>CNBC</em> noted that while it reviewed the contracts for these states, it has not seen the exact agreements for Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, and Utah, the four other states that have signed up for Apple's digital ID program.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cnbc/\">CNBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wallet/\">Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/15/apple-strict-terms-on-us-states-digital-ids/\">Apple Imposing Strict Terms on U.S. States for Digital IDs in Wallet App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-imposing-strict-terms-on-u-s-states-for-digital-ids-in-wallet-app.2323466/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eAyZ23HNfvM:WX1R-KuHrP0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eAyZ23HNfvM:WX1R-KuHrP0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4b5fa60ca0c3635a7a3a2a5ba0755b006d89a0ec42076e88935f81acc7580449","category":"Apple"}
