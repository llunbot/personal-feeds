It could have been longer. Maybe there's a director's cut. Or, maybe this is the darned good launch of an entirely new film franchise, and this film is merely meant to set up the even more fully rounded sequel(s). Whatever the case, that's a decidedly better way to leave theaters than being bored, annoyed, or otherwise shaken out of a good moviegoing experience by bad writing, acting, and directing decisions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789087#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789087&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4961f7f0d2d56dcb39668a041cf5de2baf8db63e356b927efea14accc99fb578","category":"Tech"}
