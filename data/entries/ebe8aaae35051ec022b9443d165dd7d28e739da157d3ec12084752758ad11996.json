However, here is a rough guide to matching bicycle and rider by using the diameter of the wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Size and age guide</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Wheel size</strong></td><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td><strong>Height</strong></td></tr><tr><td>12-inch</td><td>2-3</td><td>85-100cm</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch</td><td>3-4</td><td>95-110cm</td></tr><tr><td>16-inch</td><td>4-5</td><td>110-120cm</td></tr><tr><td>20-inch</td><td>5-8</td><td>120-135cm</td></tr><tr><td>24-inch</td><td>8-11</td><td>135-145cm</td></tr><tr><td>26-inch</td><td>11+</td><td>145+cm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much should I spend?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t put your tot off cycling for life by getting them a sub-standard bike. While it’s not necessary to spend loads, really cheap kids’ bikes will make learning harder and might not even last until they’re outgrown. Better to spend a bit, then look to swap with other parents later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller kids’ bikes cost less. The cheapest decent 12-inch wheeled bikes start around £150. Each size increase tends to add around £20 to £40 to this. By the time you get to 24-inch wheeled bikes the addition of gears and other components causes a rapid jump. From here on in expect to pay almost the same you would for an adult bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should I fit stabilisers?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all bikes up to and including a 20-inch wheel will accept stabilisers, and some will even come bundled with them. Although fixing on this extra set of wheels will allow your child to get riding straight away, we’re not fans. The reason is it’s impossible to learn to balance with them fitted, so removing them will feel like a backwards step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-balance-bikes-for-kids-learning-to-ride\" target=\"_blank\">balance bike</a> is a much better alternative. These crankless bikes allow kids to scoot along, teaching balance without ever building enough speed to get themselves in trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why take our word for it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03005759/open_upper_riding-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"open_upper_riding\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We live and breathe bikes at <em>Cyclist, </em>so we know what works.

Balance bikes don’t have pedals, with the rider instead using their feet on the floor to control the movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is particularly handy when it comes to getting young children used to the ideas of balance and steering before they’re ready for the real thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Strider Sport is a particularly affordable and adaptable option in the world of balance bikes: rather than forcing you to buy a new balance bike every time your child has a growth spurt, this design has an adjustable seat post that can match up with inside leg measurements anywhere between 27cm and 48cm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The handlebars can be raised in accordance with this, and the saddle can be replaced if you end up needing a bigger one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Strider Sport has a sturdy steel frame but an impressively low weight of just 2.9kg. Its one-piece composite wheels come with EVA foam tyres, which should stand the test of time as your child grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PZRKAe\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon (£114.95)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><br /></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hoozar Cruz 12: 12in wheel balance bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"686\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/02173409/hoozar_balance_bike_pink.jpg\" alt=\"hoozar_balance_bike_pink\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/02173409/hoozar_balance_bike_pink.jpg 686w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/02173409/hoozar_balance_bike_pink-300x273.jpg 300w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£120 | <a href=\"https://www.hoozarbikes.co.uk/collections/balance-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Grippy, comfortable pneumatic tyres</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rear brake for more control</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A feature-packed introduction to cycling.

Comfort comes from alloy wheels with pneumatic tyres and there are built-in footrests, so little one can get used to balancing and gliding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the 12in Airo will suit kids with inside legs from 30cm to 46cm – so from around 18 months old – the 14in is designed for 40cm to 53cm inside leg, which Hornit says should be most kids from three and a half years old. There’s a shorter seatpost available for the 12in model too.

It’s specced with LED front and rear lights too.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fkids-20-hybrid-bike-riverside-900-6-9-years%2F_%2FR-p-313214%3Fmc%3D8576531%26c%3Dgrey%2520green\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon (£299.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Riprock 20in wheel children’s bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/02173431/specialized_riprock_20-inch_wheel_childrens_bike_-970x504.jpeg\" alt=\"specialized_riprock_20-inch_wheel_childrens_bike_\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£500 | <a href=\"https://fave.co/3WSzxqt\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A junior mountain bike for proper off-road terrain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wide range nine-speed gearing</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoa! Kids’ bikes have got serious. Serious in terms of capabilities, and also serious in terms of price. However, if your five-to-eight-year-old really loves off-roading adventures, the Specialized Riprock has a lot recommending it. Ideal for cycling holidays in challenging areas such as the Lake District, the Specialized Riprock comes with massively chunky tyres on its 20in wheels, plus hydraulic disc brakes and a super-wide single-ring drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a slack aluminium frame that takes its cues from radical adult-sized bikes, irregular terrain won’t be a problem. At the same time, its free-spinning range of nine gears includes a vast 42t easiest sprocket to make major inclines manageable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still light compared to less capable children’s bikes, it’s nevertheless very much aimed at off-road adventures and is designed to be robust. However, budding roadies may still want to look elsewhere. Either way, the Riprock makes the most of its extra capabilities by being a seriously sturdy option for rugged terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a larger version of this bike, with 24in wheels, which would be suitable for 8-to 11-year-olds. Whichever size you go for, you’ll be picking a raucous bike for off-roading families.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><br /></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trek Precaliber 24 24in children’s bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Trek-Precaliber-970x576.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Trek-Precaliber-970x576.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Trek-Precaliber-300x178.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Trek-Precaliber-768x456.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Trek-Precaliber-750x446.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Trek-Precaliber-1140x677.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Trek-Precaliber.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£325 | <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fgb%2Fen_GB%2Fbikes%2Fkids-bikes%2Fkids-hybrid-bikes%2Fprecaliber%2Fprecaliber-24-8-speed%2Fp%2F36965%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dgrey\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Precaliber is sized for kids between eight and 12 years old, with a low centre of gravity, 24in wheels and eight speed derailleur gearing with low ratios, which is controlled via a twistgrip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an integrated handle in the saddle, in case the need help with balance still and a kickstand for stops.

Of course you have, that’s why most of us grew up riding over- or under-sized bikes passed down from older siblings, cousins, friends and the like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bike Club is essentially a bike rental service through which you can get your child the bike that is right for them, pay monthly and when they grow out of it trade it in for a bigger one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this Forme Cubley 14, a super-light 6kg aluminium bike recommended for three- and four-year-olds and built to withstand the British weather, costs under £10 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are loads of bikes on offer for all ages so why choose one of the above when you could have all of them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information and to check out what you can get visit <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=47723&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbikeclub.com%2Fpages%2Fhow-it-works\" target=\"_blank\">thebikeclub.co.uk</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to be able to ride further with your kids?
