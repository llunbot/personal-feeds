You are moving so ridiculously fast, speed-skating across those Marine bases and/or hellscapes, that the imps tossing fireballs at you feel like they're a parent gently coaxing their kid to catch a softball. Even the enemies with instant-hitting guns feel like they're winding up a tree sap cannon. The one time I died inside the first three levels of classic <em>Doom</em> was when I jet-walked right off a circular path and into an inescapable poison moat.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"Does a flame thrower work against creatures that literally live in Hell?

Only one way to find out. (credit: Bethesda Game Studios)</p></div>\n<p>It's easy to recommend this newly packed-up and enhanced edition of these two first-person icons, released Thursday as part of QuakeCon. For one thing, it's being offered by Nightdive Studios, which has been turning out fan-favorite (and generally Ars-approved) remasters of games like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/dark-forces-remaster-is-yet-another-all-timer-fps-coming-back-around/\"><em>Dark Forces</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/interview-how-system-shock-balanced-faithful-recreation-and-modern-design/\"><em>System Shock</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/quake-remaster-owners-should-go-download-its-free-next-gen-upgrade/\"><em>Quake</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/quake-ii-gets-a-remaster-for-pc-and-consoles-and-its-exactly-what-it-needs-to-be/\"><em>Quake II</em></a>. For another, it's a real bundle, with both games, a huge number of classic add-on maps (including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/john-romero-will-release-18-new-maps-for-dooms-25th-anniversary/\">John Romero's <em>Sigil</em></a>), and an entirely new episode, <em>Legacy of Rust</em>, made by folks from Nightdive, id Software, and <em>Wolfenstein</em> auteurs MachineGames.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042048#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042048&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"64a0769aa27cf2a807f1fc588fca00dc2f87314dbc5a85eb07368f23c1a1ba84","category":"Tech"}
