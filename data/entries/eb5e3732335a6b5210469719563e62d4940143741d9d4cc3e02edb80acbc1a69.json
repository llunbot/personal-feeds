The one exception to this rule is the iPad 9, as that device was discontinued in May, over a year and a half after the iPad 10 launched.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCheck out our previous lists of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/27/apple-discontinued-products-in-2023/\">Apple products discontinued in 2023</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/apple-discontinued-products-2022/\">2022</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/29/5-products-discontinued-by-apple-in-2021/\">2021</a> as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPad 9</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/iPad-9th-gen-feature.jpg\" width=\"2040\" height=\"1147\" />\r<br />\nOn the same day that it unveiled new iPad Pro and iPad Air models in May, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-9-discontinued-ipad-10-now-starts-at-349/\">discontinued the ninth-generation, entry-level iPad</a>. In addition, Apple lowered the price of the tenth-generation iPad, which now starts at $349 in the U.S., down from $449.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>SuperDrive</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-SuperDrives.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn August, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-superdrive-could-be-discontinued/\">SuperDrive went out of stock</a> on Apple's online store in the U.S., and it is now listed as sold out or unavailable in all countries. Given it has yet to return, it seems likely that Apple has discontinued the 16-year-old accessory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced in 2008, the SuperDrive is an external CD/DVD drive that was released alongside the original MacBook Air, which lacked a built-in CD/DVD drive. Despite having an outdated USB-A cable attached to it, the SuperDrive remained available on Apple's online store until just recently, becoming one of the company's longest-sold products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>FineWoven Cases</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven-feature.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/\">discontinued its leather accessories</a>, including iPhone cases, and it introduced a new \"FineWoven\" fabric material as a replacement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"FineWoven\" cases for the iPhone 15 series <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/\">were widely panned</a>, and it appears that Apple was well aware of this feedback, as the material is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-finewoven-cases/\">no longer offered for iPhone 16 cases</a> just a year later. It is unclear if Apple will come up with a new solution.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Powerbeats Pro</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Powerbeats-Pro-Original.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple this month quietly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/apple-discontinues-powerbeats-pro/\">discontinued the Powerbeats Pro</a>, around five and a half years after the wireless earbuds launched.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPowerbeats Pro are a sportier, fitness-focused alternative to AirPods Pro with built-in, adjustable ear hooks for a secure fit. Key features of the original Powerbeats Pro include the H1 chip that debuted in the AirPods 2, IPX4-rated sweat and water resistance, up to nine hours of battery life, and silicone ear tips with four size options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a short teaser video last month, Apple revealed that it will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/beats-teases-powerbeats-pro-2/\">launching new Powerbeats Pro 2 next year</a>. The earbuds look similar to the original Powerbeats Pro, but they have a more vertical, slimmer design. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris later discovered iOS 18 code revealing that the Powerbeats Pro 2 will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/powerbeats-pro-2-heart-rate/\">feature heart rate monitoring</a> during workouts, and gain support for Active Noise Cancellation, Spatial Audio, and Adaptive Audio.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-discontinued-these-products-in-2024/\">Apple Discontinued These Four Products This Year, But One Will Return</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinued-these-four-products-this-year-but-one-will-return.2440890/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb5e3732335a6b5210469719563e62d4940143741d9d4cc3e02edb80acbc1a69","category":"Apple"}
