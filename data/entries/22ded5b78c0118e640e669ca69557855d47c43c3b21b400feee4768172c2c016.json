This process allows for more transistors to be packed into a smaller space, delivering improvements in performance and efficiency. Apple's M4 chip, which just debuted in the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, uses an enhanced version of this ‌3nm‌ technology. The transition to 2nm chips should bring further improvements, with projected performance gains of 10 to 15 percent and power consumption reductions of up to 30 percent compared to the ‌3nm‌ process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecuring an early supply of 2nm chips is critical for Apple, as TSMC remains the only company capable of manufacturing them at the scale and quality required. This exclusivity is vital for Apple to meet the high demand for its products while limiting competitors' access to these more advanced chips. For its ‌3nm‌ chips, Apple booked all of TSMC's available chipmaking capacity.
