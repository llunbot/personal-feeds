{"title":"Apple releases first iOS 18.3 beta","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/apple-releases-first-ios-18-3-beta.html","date":1734378631000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Less than a week after the release of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-ipados-18-2-features-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-security-release.html\">iOS 18.2</a>, Apple has begun beta-testing the next iOS update. It’s not yet clear when we can expect this release to into wide release or what features to expect in it, but it will surely be the first major iOS update of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence has been the focus of most iOS 18 updates so far, and we’re still waiting on the big Siri overhaul that adds personal context using the data on your phone and scores of new “app intents” that allow Siri to perform actions in apps. Those features are generally expected to come in iOS 18.4, which most believe will be released in March or April. If true, then iOS 18.3 would focus mainly on tweaks and improvements to existing features and will pause the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of December 16, Apple has only released the first Developer Beta—Public Beta testing will likely begin later in the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.3: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t yet know what significant new features are included in the iOS 18.3 beta, but we will update this section as we explore the update and learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.3: How to install the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. You don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting <em>iOS Public Beta</em> in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.3: How to install the public beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The public beta isn’t out yet, but we expect it will arrive in a few short days. If you want to be among the first to test iOS 18.3, you can sign up for the public beta test. The process for installing a beta has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click Sign Up on the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/\">Apple Beta page</a> and register with your Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in to the Beta Software Program.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Enroll your iOS device</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app, tap <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d5eacb96fe4f280d460997d5ef6b3174b37f8a60e440af783102733a8e730ca4","category":"Apple"}
