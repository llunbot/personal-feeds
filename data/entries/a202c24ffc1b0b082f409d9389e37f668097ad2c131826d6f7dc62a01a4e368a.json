It's not exactly official yet but is rolling out to several people.</p>\n<p>While the Play Store app on Android devices is continually updated, the website has mostly been forgotten. The current Google Play website design dates back<a href=\"http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2013/07/redesigned-google-play-store-site.html\"> to 2013</a>. The site has had some small tweaks since then, but the bones of the site are still eight years old, and it presents content in a card motif that Google has moved on from. The new website looks just like the Android app. That means lots of whitespace and a layout focused on app icons and video thumbnails.</p>\n<p>Back in 2013, Google envisioned the Play Store as a one-stop shop for all content from Google. At the peak of its powers, the Play Store sidebar had six sections: Apps (and Games), Movies &amp; TV, Music (and podcasts), Books, Magazines (and News subscriptions), and even a physical \"Devices\" section for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/04/unlocked-samsung-galaxy-nexus-can-now-be-purchased-from-google/\">Nexus phones</a>. Today, Google Play is a lot less powerful. Music has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/\">been taken</a> from Google Play Music and is now a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/youtube-music-continues-glacial-development-pace-adds-background-playback/\">YouTube product.</a>Â Podcasts now live at Google Podcasts and will probably also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ars-podcast/2021/10/youtube-podcasts-will-reportedly-be-the-next-piece-of-youtubes-media-empire/\">be taken over</a> by YouTube in the future. YouTube and Google Play Movies &amp; TV currently overlap, since they both sell premium Hollywood video content. On some platforms,<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/google-is-killing-google-play-movies-tv-on-smart-tvs/\"> like Smart TVs</a>, Google is shutting down the Play section in favor of YouTube. Devices are now sold at the standalone <a href=\"https://store.google.com/\">Google Store</a> website.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814297#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814297&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a202c24ffc1b0b082f409d9389e37f668097ad2c131826d6f7dc62a01a4e368a","category":"Tech"}
