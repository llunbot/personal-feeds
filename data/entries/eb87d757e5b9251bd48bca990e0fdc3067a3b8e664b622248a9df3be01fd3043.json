Welcome to <em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>.                      [credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://milestone.it/\">Milestone S.r.l / Mattel</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>This week's <em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em> is one of the best video games ever made using licensed toy cars. To be fair, that specific concept isn't necessarily common in gaming, but Codemasters' legendary <em>Micro Machines</em> series holds a lot of water for a certain type of arcade-racing fan. That's decent company to land in.</p>\n<p>Yet while handsomely modeled toy cars and cute environments might look like a basis for newbie-friendly racing, it's not the case here. In my week of testing the game ahead of its launch this week, I found that <em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em> feels like a <em>Micro Machines</em> skin on top of the modern, hardcore-leaning <em>Trackmania</em> series. That's not a bad thing—and I had a good-enough time with <em>Unleashed</em> to write about it at Ars, as I think some people will really enjoy what's going on here.</p>\n<p>But you'll have a better time with <em>HWU</em> going into it fully aware of its weird and tricky design decisions—along with quibbles about its in-game economy of cars and tracks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799401#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799401&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb87d757e5b9251bd48bca990e0fdc3067a3b8e664b622248a9df3be01fd3043","category":"Tech"}
