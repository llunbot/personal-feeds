But to this day, there's a small community of people still developing software for PowerPC Macs and Mac OS 9.</p>\n\n<p>One of those projects was <a href=\"https://www.floodgap.com/software/tenfourfox/\">TenFourFox</a>, a fork of the Firefox browser for G3, G4, and G5-based PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5. Maintained primarily by Cameron Kaiser, the TenFourFox project sprang up in late 2010 after Mozilla pulled PowerPC support from Firefox 4 during its development. And amazingly, the browser has continued to trundle on ever since.</p>\n<p>But continuing to backport Firefox features to aging, stuck-in-time PowerPC processors only got more difficult as time went on. And in March of this year, Kaiser <a href=\"https://tenfourfox.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-end-of-tenfourfox-and-what-ive.html\">announced that TenFourFox updates would be ending</a> after over a decade of development. The final planned release of TenFourFox was earlier this month.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804083#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804083&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3200f424992b33db75d4ab760e18e4963b8a43f2a19f97b89fbd24e6e98653e7","category":"Tech"}
