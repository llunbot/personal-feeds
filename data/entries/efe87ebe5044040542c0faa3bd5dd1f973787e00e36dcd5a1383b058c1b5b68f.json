The main artwork being used to promote the event features the ‌Apple Pencil‌ and Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> today hinted at the importance of the accessory to the event in a new post on X (formerly Twitter):\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Pencil us in for May 7! ✏️ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AppleEvent</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1tvyB7h450\">pic.twitter.com/1tvyB7h450</a></p>— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1782785458881302714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwo new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models and a redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory are also expected to be unveiled at the event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe May 7 Apple event will take place at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time), with a live stream to be available on apple.com and on YouTube.
