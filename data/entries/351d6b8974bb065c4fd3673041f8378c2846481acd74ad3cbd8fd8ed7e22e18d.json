A new camera control button can be clicked to take a photo, and also is touch-sensitive, allowing you to slide your finger across it to tweak the settings for the images, like zoom. It can tell the difference between a full click and a lighter press, which allows you to access customization features instead of taking a picture right away.</p>\n<p>That's not the only new button; the configurable Action button has arrived on the iPhone 16. It was introduced in the Pro models last year and can be used for various predetermined purposes or assigned to work with Shortcuts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048405#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048405&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"351d6b8974bb065c4fd3673041f8378c2846481acd74ad3cbd8fd8ed7e22e18d","category":"Tech"}
