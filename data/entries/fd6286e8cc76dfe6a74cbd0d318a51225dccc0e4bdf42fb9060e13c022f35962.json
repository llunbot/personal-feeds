You’ll also get a speedy M2 processor, all-day battery life, fast charging with a MagSafe connector and a pair of Thunderbolt ports. Apple is expected to update the laptop soon but it’s likely to be little more than a speed bump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we praised the “absolutely excellent processor” and “bright, sharp, and colorful” display, but that’s nothing compared to what Vision Pro will turn it into. So grab one now and get ready for the age of spatial computing.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fd6286e8cc76dfe6a74cbd0d318a51225dccc0e4bdf42fb9060e13c022f35962","category":"Apple"}
