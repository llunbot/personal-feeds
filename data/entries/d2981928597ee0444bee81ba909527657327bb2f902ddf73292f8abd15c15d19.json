One ability apparently pitched by executives was the ability to invest in Apple shares using spare cash. The feature would have bolstered the collaboration between Apple and Goldman Sachs, which now includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> Later, and Daily Cash Savings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWork on the project reportedly began in 2020, when interest rates were low and there was record interest in trading shares. Apple developed the feature and planned to roll it out at some point in 2022. When markets worsened last year, Apple and Goldman Sachs shelved the project due to fears over backlash if users lost money in the stock market, and refocused attention on a high-interest savings account for ‌Apple Card‌ users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe infrastructure for the investing feature is apparently mostly built and ready to launch if Apple eventually decides to proceed with it, but there are no immediate signs that it has plans to do so.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/goldman-sachs/\">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cnbc-com/\">CNBC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/apple-planned-to-launch-trading-feature/\">Apple and Goldman Sachs Planned to Launch iPhone Stock Trading Feature Last Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-goldman-sachs-planned-to-launch-iphone-stock-trading-feature-last-year.2403446/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2981928597ee0444bee81ba909527657327bb2f902ddf73292f8abd15c15d19","category":"Apple"}
