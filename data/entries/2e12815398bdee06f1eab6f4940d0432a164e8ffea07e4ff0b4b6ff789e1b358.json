Rather than getting the body to try to fix itself with its cells or deal with the complications of organ transplants, we could convert a few adult cells to stem cells and induce them to form any tissue in the body. We could potentially repair or replace tissues with an effectively infinite supply of a patient's own cells.</p>\n<p>However, the Nobel Prize for induced stem cells was handed out over a decade ago, and the therapies have been slow to follow. But a group of German researchers is now describing tests in primates of a method of repairing the heart using new muscle generated from stem cells. The results are promising, if not yet providing everything that we might hope for. But they've been enough to start clinical trials, and similar results are being seen in humans.</p>\n<h2>Heart problems</h2>\n<p>The heart contains a lot of specialized tissues, including those that form blood vessels or specialize in conducting electrical signals. But the key to the heart is a form of specialized muscle cell, called a cardiomyocyte. Once the heart matures, the cardiomyocytes stop dividing, meaning that you end up with a fixed population. Any damage to the heart due to injury or infection does not get repaired, meaning damage will be cumulative.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/stem-cells-used-to-partially-repair-damaged-hearts/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/stem-cells-used-to-partially-repair-damaged-hearts/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e12815398bdee06f1eab6f4940d0432a164e8ffea07e4ff0b4b6ff789e1b358","category":"Tech"}
