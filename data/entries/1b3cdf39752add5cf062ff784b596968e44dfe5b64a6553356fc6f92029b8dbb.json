Despite its best intentions—and against its <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/\">terms of service</a>—its AI language models are often <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697218/ai-generated-spam-fake-user-reviews-as-an-ai-language-model\">used to compose spam</a>, and its pioneering research has inspired others to build AI models that can potentially do the same. This influx of AI-generated content has further reduced the effectiveness of SEO-driven search engines like Google. In 2024, web search is in a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-search-is-losing-the-fight-with-seo-spam-study-says/\">sorry state indeed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It's interesting, then, that OpenAI is now offering a potential solution to that problem. On Thursday, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/\">revealed</a> a prototype AI-powered search engine called SearchGPT that aims to provide users with quick, accurate answers sourced from the web. It's also a direct challenge to Google, which also has tried to apply generative AI to web search (but with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/\">little success</a>).</p>\n<p>The company says it plans to integrate the most useful aspects of the temporary prototype into <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a> in the future. ChatGPT (and Microsoft Copilot) can already perform web searches using Bing, but SearchGPT seems to be OpenAI's purpose-built interface for AI-assisted web searching.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039302#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039302&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b3cdf39752add5cf062ff784b596968e44dfe5b64a6553356fc6f92029b8dbb","category":"Tech"}
