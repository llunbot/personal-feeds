Last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/itc-opposes-apple-watch-sales-ban-pause/\">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents. Apple is appealing the decision, and could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/\">re-enable the Blood Oxygen app with a watchOS update</a> if it is overturned.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAvailability began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/refurbished-apple-watch-ultra-2-begins-rolling-out/\">in the U.K. and China</a> earlier this week, and the Blood Oxygen app remains functional outside of the U.S. currently.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are no refurbished Apple Watch Series 9 models available on Apple's store in the U.S. yet.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/refurbished-apple-watch-ultra-2-in-us/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2 Now Available on Apple's Refurbished Store in U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-2-now-available-on-apples-refurbished-store-in-u-s.2424524/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba367972c8dfc4ac5f5a8f1d80f78014d2b2ce67f84c5bd25847cda1539846a8","category":"Apple"}
