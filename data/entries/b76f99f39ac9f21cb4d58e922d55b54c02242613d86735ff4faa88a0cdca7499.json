But it looks like the first hardware element of the Vision Pro launch could appear as soon as this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the prolific and widely respected analyst <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1670619672096686080&amp;xcust=1-1-1958352-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15</a>, expected to launch in fall 2023, is likely to feature an upgraded ultra wideband (UWB) chip designed to ensure seamless integration with Vision Pro. Apple introduced the U1 chip in 2019 with the iPhone 11 and has subsequently included it in all iPhone models since as well as the Apple Watch Series 6, 7, and 8, and the Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The ecosystem is one of the key success factors for Vision Pro, including the integration with other Apple hardware products,” Kuo explains. The iPhone 15, therefore, “will likely see an specification upgrade of UWB, with the production process moving from 16nm to more advanced 7nm, allowing for improved performance or reduced power consumption for nearby Interactions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Apple將積極升級硬體產品規格以建構更有競爭力的Vision Pro生態<br /><br />1. Vision Pro的成功關鍵之一在於生態，當中包括能否與其他Apple硬體產品整合，而與此相關的主要硬體規格為Wi-Fi與UWB。<br /><br />2. iPhone 15採用的UWB將規格升級，生產製程由16nm升級到更先進的7nm，有利近距離互動的效能提升或降低耗電。…</p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1670619672096686080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1958352-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">June 19, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This might seem a little odd since the iPhone 15 will hit stores with at least three months of 2023 remaining, and the headset is unlikely to appear until at least halfway through the 15’s lifecycle. But Apple will need its current-gen products to work well with Vision Pro from day one, and the improved UWB chip is likely to bring additional benefits other than integration with the headset: more accurate AirTag tracking, for example, or reduced power consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might also be tempting to try to draw clues from this prediction as to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">launch timeframe for Vision Pro</a>; at the very least, it strongly suggests that Apple expects the headset to land before the iPhone 16 appears in September 2024, and probably quite a long time before that. But the consensus was already that Apple would try to push out Vision Pro next spring, so this isn’t really new information. (And in any case, delays can always afflict a completely new product line, as has happened to Vision Pro over the past few years. Even if Apple <em>plans</em> to launch in the spring, the headset could end up getting pushed back for reasons beyond its control.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo adds that a further Vision-oriented upgrade will appear on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1919496/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-periscope-camera-buttons.html\">iPhone 16 in late 2024</a>, with an upgrade to Wi-Fi 7.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b76f99f39ac9f21cb4d58e922d55b54c02242613d86735ff4faa88a0cdca7499","category":"Apple"}
