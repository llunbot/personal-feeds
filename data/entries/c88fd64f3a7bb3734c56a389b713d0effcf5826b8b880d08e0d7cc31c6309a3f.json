Riding with a mirror offers the reassuring feeling of being aware of your surroundings. It can keep you from twisting your neck and taking your eyes off of the road and terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, if you ride with your kiddos in tow, It’s important to be able to check in on them. Using a mirror is a smart, safe way to keep an eye on your muchkins. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spurcycle C Series Mirrors</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C-Series-e1722446281980.jpeg\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C-Series-e1722446281980.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycles New Mirrors C Series\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C-Series-e1722446281980.jpeg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C-Series-e1722446281980-297x164.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C-Series-e1722446281980-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C-Series-e1722446281980-768x425.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>C50 and C70 Mirror</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $34 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “C” and the numbers “50”, and “70” signify two different things on the C Series Mirrors. The “C” means that the C Series Mirrors are designed for “City” bikes, and not for use with drop bars. The “50” and “70” signifies the size of the mirror. The C50 has a mirror that is 50mm in diameter, whereas the C70 has a 70mm diameter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-morror-view-e1722446313916.jpeg\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-morror-view-e1722446313916.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycles New Mirrors C70 side morror view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-morror-view-e1722446313916.jpeg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-morror-view-e1722446313916-297x177.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-morror-view-e1722446313916-120x71.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-morror-view-e1722446313916-768x457.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like their <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/products/better-bicycle-bell\" target=\"_blank\">Original Bell</a>, the C Series Mirrors are a perfect blending of form and function. They’ve been slimmed down to fit through doorways and get through tight traffic. Durable enough to handle the hustle and bustle of busy city activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-view-e1722446335862.jpeg\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-view-e1722446335862.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycles New Mirrors C70 side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-view-e1722446335862.jpeg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-view-e1722446335862-297x169.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-view-e1722446335862-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-C70-side-view-e1722446335862-768x436.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the sizes of the mirrors are different, they offer the same refined, quality view, with a bit more field of view in the larger mirror. Both mirrors use tempered glass to ensure optical clarity. They also sport a robust, and rigid arm that minimizes image vibration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secure ball &amp; socket offer smooth, adjustable tension.

The “R” means these mirrors were designed for drop bars or “road” bikes. The numbers “35” and “50” are the sizes of the two options. Spurcycle says that they consider the R35 to be their “pro” (vanity) mirror, and the R50 their “everyday touring model”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-mirror-e1722446365992.jpeg\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-mirror-e1722446365992.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycles New Mirrors R35 mirror\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-mirror-e1722446365992.jpeg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-mirror-e1722446365992-297x172.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-mirror-e1722446365992-120x69.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-mirror-e1722446365992-768x444.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The R Series Mirrors are designed for the modern drop bar bicycle and are not compatible with bars that have extreme geometry, or positions. <em>“Some ENVE bars without standard bar plugs may not work.” </em> If you have questions you can email photos of your setup and Spurcycle will help you out. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-side-view-e1722446389466.jpeg\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-side-view-e1722446389466.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycles New Mirrors R35 side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-side-view-e1722446389466.jpeg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-side-view-e1722446389466-297x86.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-side-view-e1722446389466-120x35.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spurcycles-New-Mirrors-R35-side-view-e1722446389466-768x221.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The R Series Mirrors offer the same “maximum utility from minimum form” as all of Spurcycle’s products.
