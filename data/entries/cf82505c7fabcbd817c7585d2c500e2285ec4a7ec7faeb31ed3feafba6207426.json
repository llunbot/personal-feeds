It starts on Tuesday and continues for 48 hours of deals and discounts. So, whether this is your first Prime Day rodeo or you’ve taken advantage of fantastic discounts before, here’s everything you need to know about the big sale</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Prime Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Day is the annual shopping event that gets us about as excited for Apple deals as Black Friday. The first year Prime Day was held was in 2015 when Amazon wanted to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a bang. The sale was so successful that it stuck around and we’re happy it did because the discounts are impressive and many brands use Prime Day as the chance to lower the price more than they usually would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of the single-day event from back in the day, we get a full 48 hours to shop for deals and decide what we need and what we simply “want.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Prime Day 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024 Prime Day will begin at midnight on Tuesday, July 16 and last until 11:59pm on Wednesday, July 17. That’s midnight to midnight wherever you are in the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will we get another Prime Day in October?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has been pretty consistent about its big sale events, so when it introduced the October event a couple of years ago, we figured it was here to stay. Well, we can’t predict the future with certainty, but Amazon seems like the type to stick to tradition. While we don’t have any official info on an October event, we’re going to guess that yes, we will get a new fall Prime Day event.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do you need to subscribe to Prime to shop on Prime Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes and no. Let us explain. As the name suggests, Prime Day was designed as a special sale event to reward Prime members with special prices. So, you’d need to have a subscription to the service (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree\" target=\"_blank\">$14.99</a>/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree\" target=\"_blank\">£8.99</a>/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/tryprimefree\" target=\"_blank\">AUD$6.99</a> per month or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree\">$139</a>/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree\">£95</a>/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/tryprimefree\">AUD$59</a> per year). You can also sign up for the 30-day free trial to cover the Prime Day deals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are loads and loads of deals available during the event when a subscription to Prime is not necessary. They will just be straight-up discounts that anyone can enjoy. Whether or not your favorite products from Apple and other big brands will fall into this category remains to be seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What products do we expect to go on sale?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect to get great discounts on pretty much all products from Apple. Devices such as the MacBook Pro and Air and Apple Watch Series 9 that have been on shelves for a while usually see their best discounts on Prime Day, but even newer devices like the iPad Air and Pro and so do iPads, but we’ll have to wait and see for the others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we’re also expecting to see tons of good deals on various Apple accessories that you may need for your devices, including Apple Pencils, keyboards, and mice, as well as stands, chargers, and cables from third-party accessory makers such as Anker and Logitech.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do other retailers run sales during Prime Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During Prime Day, other retailers will certainly try to bring in some shoppers, including Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. While we’re sure many deals will be exclusive to Amazon, many brands will run similar sales in other shops, too. You could end up getting a product you want for the same price as it is at Amazon without needing to subscribe to Prime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to find the best Prime Day deals on Apple products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right here! We’ll be covering Prime Day this year and scouring Amazon for the best Apple deals. So just stay tuned to Macworld all week long, and we’ll tell you which deals are worth your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2391988/best-apple-prime-day-2024-early-deals.html\">Best Amazon Prime Day Apple deals</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382647/best-airpods-prime-day-2024-early-deals.html\"><strong>Best Amazon Prime Day AirPods deals</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2386629/best-apple-watch-prime-day-2024-early-deals.html\"><strong>Best Amazon Prime Day Apple Watch deals</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382944/best-iphone-prime-day-2024-early-deals.html\"><strong>Best Amazon Prime Day iPhone deals</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2387154/best-ipad-prime-day-2024-early-deals.html\">Best <strong>Amazon Prime Day iPad deals</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2385468/best-macbook-prime-day-2024-early-deals.html\"><strong>Best Amazon Prime Day MacBook Air and MacBook Pro deals</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382849/best-mac-prime-day-2024-early-deals.html\"><strong>Best Amazon Prime Day Mac deals</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the best deals right now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are always great deals available at Amazon, so we’ll be updating this list regularly until Prime Day drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple devices</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro (2nd gen, USB-C): $</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">199</a> ($50 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75\">13-inch M4 iPad Pro (128GB)</a>: $1,198 ($101 off, MSRP $1,299)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSV9Y331/\">Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm)</a>: $299 ($100 off, MSRP $399)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y\" target=\"_blank\">M2 13-inch MacBook Air, 256GB</a>: $799 ($200 off, MSRP $999)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5LN355\" target=\"_blank\">M3 Pro 14-inch MacBook Pro, 512GB</a>: $1,699 ($300 off, MSRP $1,999)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHFS6XX\" target=\"_blank\">M2 Pro Mac mini, 512GB</a>: $1,149 ($150 off, MSRP $1,299)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJY2DFH\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Plus (128GB): £599</a> (£200 off; RRP £799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CHX95F2H\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 15 (128GB): £681</a> (£118 off; RRP £799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BJMBJS3S\">11-inch iPad Pro (M2, 512GB, 2022 model)</a>: £1,041.87 (£207.13 off, old RRP was £1,249)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJ8K97S/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>: £649.65 (RRP was £849, discontinued)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CX236Q36\" target=\"_blank\">M3 15-inch MacBook Air, 512GB</a>:  £1,329.97 (£169 off, MSRP £1,499)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CM615TKC\" target=\"_blank\">M3 Pro 14-inch MacBook Pro, 1TB</a>: £2,229.97 (£269 off, MSRP £2,499)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Docking-Station-Monitor-Ethernet/dp/B0CJBSS7Z9\">Baseus Docking Station</a> – $52 (35% off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65\">Anker 30W USB-C GaN Charger</a> – $20 (13% off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Magnetic-Portable-10000mAh-Charging/dp/B0BZVVR495\">INIU Magsafe Portable Charger</a> – $27 (35% off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VEEKTOMX-10000mAh-Charging-Portable-Competible/dp/B09BBCPC3X\">VEEKTOMX Mini Power Bank 10000mAh</a> – $20 (45% off)</li>\n</ul>\n\nAccessories, Apple Inc, Apple Watch, Smartwatches</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cf82505c7fabcbd817c7585d2c500e2285ec4a7ec7faeb31ed3feafba6207426","category":"Apple"}
