While it's not as big as Biden's original broadband plan, the Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society <a href=\"https://www.benton.org/blog/largest-us-investment-broadband-deployment-ever\">called it</a> \"the largest US investment in broadband deployment ever.\"</p>\n<p>The biggest portion of the broadband spending is $42.45 billion for a Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program that would give subsidies to ISPs that build in unserved areas. Another $14.2 billion goes to an Affordable Connectivity Fund that is essentially a longer-term version of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/50-monthly-broadband-discounts-available-starting-today-via-825-isps/\">Emergency Broadband Benefit Program</a> created for the pandemic. Under the new version, subsidies for eligible households will be $30 a month instead of the original $50.</p>\n<p>Another broadband provision gives $2.75 billion for digital equity grants to states to \"facilitate the adoption of broadband by covered populations in order to provide educational and employment opportunities to those populations.\" Grants can cover a variety of needs including training, broadband equipment, and \"public access computing centers for covered populations through community anchor institutions.\" Covered populations include low-income households, racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, veterans, people with disabilities, people with language barriers, and people who are 60 or older.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811216#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811216&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e598a8b586ea0a843a1270a689677294d70c7c928ce1025f4317e39b6bdf849b","category":"Tech"}
