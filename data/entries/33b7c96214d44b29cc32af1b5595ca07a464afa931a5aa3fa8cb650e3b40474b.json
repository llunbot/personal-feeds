This functionality is provided at no extra charge in supported countries, delivered via free software updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing the personalised hearing profile generated from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/take-a-hearing-test-with-airpods-pro-2-ios/\">Hearing Test</a> that takes about five minutes to complete, the feature helps adults determine whether they have hearing loss by assessing how well they can detect various sound frequencies. Upon completion, users receive a classification of their hearing level along with suggested actions. Meanwhile, their hearing profile is automatically applied to music, movies, games, and phone calls across devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's hearing health features first launched in the US and select other countries in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/ios-18-1-hearing-aid-feature/\">late October</a> with the release of iOS 18.1. In December, iOS 18.2 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/ios-18-2-expands-airpods-pro-2-hearing-test/\">expanded</a> the hearing test feature to France, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania, Spain, Cyprus, Czechia, and the UK, and both the hearing aid and hearing test features to the United Arab Emirates. Today's announcement means that both the hearing test and the Hearing Aid feature are finally available to users in the UK.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nAll of the hearing health features on the AirPods Pro 2 require firmware version 7B19 or newer. Firmware updates are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/update-airpods-firmware/\">installed automatically</a> on AirPods while they are charging and in Bluetooth range of an iPhone, iPad, or Mac connected to Wi-Fi. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-feature-now-in-uk/\">AirPods Pro 2 Hearing Aid Feature Now Available in the UK</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-feature-now-available-in-the-uk.2450057/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"33b7c96214d44b29cc32af1b5595ca07a464afa931a5aa3fa8cb650e3b40474b","category":"Apple"}
