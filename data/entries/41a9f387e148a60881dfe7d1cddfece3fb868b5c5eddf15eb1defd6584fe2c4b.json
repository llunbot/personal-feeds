The service then functions similarly to the web-based ChatGPT, but with the convenience of the WhatsApp interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe expansion builds upon the initial WhatsApp integration launched in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/openai-chatgpt-phone-line/\">December 2024</a>, which was limited to text-based interactions. OpenAI also plans to introduce account linking functionality that will allow users to connect their existing ChatGPT accounts — whether Free, Plus, or Pro — where they can keep tabs on their chat history and get more usage out of the service in Meta's app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p> 1-800-ChatGPT WhatsApp Updates<br /><br />- You can now upload images when asking a question<br /><br />- You can talk to ChatGPT using voice messages<br /><br />- And coming soon, you can link your ChatGPT account (Free, Plus, Pro) for more usage</p>— OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1886966048970478016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nAny US phone number can contact ChatGPT and get 15 minutes of response time for free without an OpenAI account, but downloading the app and creating an account allows for additional call time.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/whatsapp-send-images-voice-messages-chatgpt/\">WhatsApp Users Can Now Send Images and Voice Messages to ChatGPT</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-users-can-now-send-images-and-voice-messages-to-chatgpt.2448816/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41a9f387e148a60881dfe7d1cddfece3fb868b5c5eddf15eb1defd6584fe2c4b","category":"Apple"}
