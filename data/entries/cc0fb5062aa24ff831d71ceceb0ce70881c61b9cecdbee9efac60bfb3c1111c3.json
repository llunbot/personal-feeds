The ST5 Pinion is a new version of the company’s ST5 model, offering significant upgrades like a Pinion gearbox, wireless Smart.Shift gear shifting, and front brakes with ABS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ST5 Pinion is a top-tier e-commuter that provides Stromer’s typically long range (110 miles max), among the other technologically advanced features listed above. Consumers can purchase the ST5 Pinion by the end of the month, but Stromer has two complete models in the USA for show. One will be displayed at the CABDA Expo in Chicago next month if you’re in the area.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stromer ST5 Pinion: Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"702\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-Gates-drive-belt.jpg\" alt=\"Stromer ST5 Pinion, Pinion drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-Gates-drive-belt.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-Gates-drive-belt-297x174.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-Gates-drive-belt-800x468.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-Gates-drive-belt-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-Gates-drive-belt-768x449.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Calling it “the executive among speed pedelecs”, the ST5 Pinion is an updated version of Stromer’s ST5 model boasting top-tier components and features. The most notable upgrade is the 9-speed Pinion C 1.9i gearbox, which is connected to an electronic Pinion Smart.Shift system via a Gates carbon drive belt. If you’re not familiar, with the Smart.Shift system is Pinion’s electronic push-button shifter. It does not offer automatic gear shifting, but gears can be changed while riding, under load, or at a standstill.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"775\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-ABS-front-brake.jpg\" alt=\"Stromer ST5 Pinion, ABS front brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-ABS-front-brake.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-ABS-front-brake-297x192.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-ABS-front-brake-800x517.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-ABS-front-brake-120x78.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-ABS-front-brake-768x496.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ST5 Pinion also gets an anti-lock (ABS) front brake system from BluBrake, to reduce the chance of front-wheel skidding (especially in wet or slippery conditions).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new model now includes the Stromer Sound module. The module provides acoustic notification signals indicating things like start-up, shut down, battery level, cruise control, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"901\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-front-fender.jpg\" alt=\"Stromer ST5 Pinion, front fender\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-front-fender.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-front-fender-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-front-fender-800x601.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-front-fender-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-front-fender-768x577.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the updated ST5 Pinion gets a new recyclable carbon-reinforced polyamide front fender. The fender can be mounted in ‘long’ or ‘short’ positions using the provided adapters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ST5 Pinion: Key Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-side-studio.jpg\" alt=\"Stromer ST5 Pinion, side, studio\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-side-studio.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-side-studio-297x166.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-side-studio-800x447.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-side-studio-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-side-studio-768x429.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ST5 Pinion is built on an aluminum frame, covered by a 10-year warranty.

It’s driven by a SYNO Sport 750w rear hub motor, which offers 48Nm of torque. The motor’s Sport mode offers an extra powerful setting when you need lots of boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 48V, 983Wh battery provides a lengthy range of up to 110 miles. The battery can be ejected with the push of a button, and it fully charges in 5 hours 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ST5 Pinion’s top tube mounted on-board display shows your key info and ride metrics. The Stromer OMNI app allows you to adjust motor settings and enables Bluetooth unlocking/locking. The app also lets you see all the info the top tube display shows on your smartphone too. The bike uses cellular network connectivity for features like GPS localization, Smartlock, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"764\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-lights.jpg\" alt=\"Stromer ST5 Pinion, lights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-lights.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-lights-297x189.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-lights-800x509.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-lights-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinion-lights-768x489.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to Stromer’s integrated daylight, the ST5 Pinion includes a Supernova M99 Pro 2 headlight (1600 lumen max).

Not skimping on touchpoints, Stromer gave this bike Brooks Cambium ergonomic grips, and a Selle Royal Vivo saddle. Stromer also includes pedals and side mirrors with each bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinon-guy-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Stromer ST5 Pinion, rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinon-guy-riding.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinon-guy-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinon-guy-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinon-guy-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinon-guy-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stromer-ST5-Pinon-guy-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /><figcaption>*Photos c.
