The desired tension is pre-set by the rider, and the whole thing takes just a second to open or close, making them a fast option for triathletes trying to speed through transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That lever also doubles as an aerodynamic feature, smoothing airflow off the back of the shoe, too. And the outsole is smoothed and sculpted to further reduce overall drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-drag-comparison-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-drag-comparison-chart.jpg\" alt=\"VeloVetta Monarch aero road bike shoes drag comparison chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-drag-comparison-chart.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-drag-comparison-chart-297x206.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-drag-comparison-chart-800x554.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-drag-comparison-chart-120x83.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-drag-comparison-chart-768x532.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tested at the A2 Wind Tunnel against the Bontrager Ballista, Shimano TR9, and Specialized S-Works 7, the chart above shows the results with a 30mph wind ranging from +/-12.5º. Compared to the others, the Monarch averaged a power savings of 8.6 to 14.2 watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say that’s good for 32 seconds in a 40k time trial versus the S-Works 7, which was actually the closest in performance to the Monarch. Against the TR9 shoe, they estimate a 4m 20s savings over an Ironman bike leg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1.jpg\" alt=\"velovetta monarch aero road bike and triathlon cycling shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“We designed the shoe to be fast,” says CEO Ed O’Malley, “but equally important it is designed to be comfortable all day, with a unique heel closure mechanism that makes transitions fast and easy, (with) power transfer to rival any other shoe.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upper and tongue are padded, and they say it pulls downward to hold your foot without squeezing it from the sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-2.jpg\" alt=\"velovetta monarch aero road bike and triathlon cycling shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-2.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-2-297x174.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-2-800x470.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-2-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VeloVetta-Monarch-aero-road-bike-shoes-2-768x451.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Malley, who is an engineer with experience working on the International space station and hydrogen fueled engines, says he noticed people taking whatever shoes they had to the wind tunnel just to see which were the most aero, and decided he could make something that was intentionally, rather than accidentally, aerodynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Athletes spend a lot of time trying to figure out which shoe is aerodynamically the fastest,” O’Malley said, “but no one had made a serious analytical effort at designing one. The Monarch is the first shoe designed using the same technology and techniques as bike frames, helmets, and yes, aircraft.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While based in Boulder, CO, VeloVetta’s shoes are made in Treviso, Italy, at a well-known shoe manufacturer. They’re available in sizes 38 thru 47 with limited half sizes. MSRP is $405, available in black or white/gray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.velovetta.com\" target=\"_blank\">VeloVetta.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/velovetta-monarch-aim-to-be-the-most-aerodynamic-road-bike-shoes/\">VeloVetta Monarch Aim to be the Most Aerodynamic Road Bike Shoes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"73964390dd0becaecc1dc683ece43e6a886403ec0d7c45e9aed7f388beb82928","category":"Cycling"}
