Meet the new <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/hybrid-bikes/electric-hybrid-bikes/fx/fx-7s/p/47897/?colorCode=black\" target=\"_blank\">FX+7 City eBike</a>. The FX+7 is a high-end, lightweight, city eBike that is “light enough to carry up stairs and powerful enough to fly up climbs.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s see…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-top-tube-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"761\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-top-tube-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike top tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-top-tube-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-top-tube-297x177.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-top-tube-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-top-tube-768x457.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Trek Bicycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Trek FX+7</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-carrying-handle-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"777\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-carrying-handle-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike carrying handle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-carrying-handle-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-carrying-handle-297x180.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-carrying-handle-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-carrying-handle-768x466.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Lightweight, with a handle to carry it! </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming to weigh in at 40 lbs, the FX+7 could be heaven for the right commuter. It comes equipped with everything you may need on a bike like this. For instance, it comes complete with a rear rack that fits both MIK rear and side panniers, front and rear lights, and full coverage fenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike in the black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-black-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The riding position is what Trek is calling “active”, which looks to me like an upright position, but with a slightly more aggressive posture. The FX+7 is equipped with a compact TQ HPR50 motor that delivers 50Nm of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-city-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-city-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike in the city\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-city-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-city-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-city-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-in-the-city-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the stealthy, integrated 360Wh battery you get a claimed range of up to 50 miles and up to 75 miles with the optional 160Wh range extender. It boasts an assisted top speed of 28 mph and has a battery size of 360Wh. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Phone Integration</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-integrated-cockpit-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-integrated-cockpit-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike integrated cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-integrated-cockpit-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-integrated-cockpit-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-integrated-cockpit-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-integrated-cockpit-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinda buried in the specs is the fact that the FX+7 also offers true smartphone integration. It’s about time that ebikes offered the option of charging your phone as you ride, <em>while</em> using it for navigation, and that’s exactly what the FX+7 provides. Thanks to the Quad Lock wireless charging mount on the integrated handlebar and stem, you can seamlessly mount and charge your phone while riding. Trek doesn’t go into detail, but based off the specs of other Quad Lock charging mounts, it should be compatible with Apple and Android devices that are wireless charging compatible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders can also connect to the Trek Central app to customize assist levels, get turn-by-turn directions, estimate range, plus much more. This means you can use your phone as the ebike display screen, but it’s completely optional since there is also a small display screen on the top tube. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Shimano-CUES-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Shimano-CUES-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike Shimano CUES\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Shimano-CUES-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Shimano-CUES-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Shimano-CUES-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Shimano-CUES-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The drivetrain on the Trek FX+7 is the durable and reliable Shimano CUES with Linkglide technology. This drivetrain offers smoother shifting, made for eBikes. Plus, it is very durable, offering longer life and less visits to the bike shop. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-headlight-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-headlight-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike headlight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-headlight-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-headlight-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-headlight-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-headlight-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Integrated front and rear lights\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek FX+7 Retail &amp; Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Full-bike-Green-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Full-bike-Green-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike Full bike Green\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Full-bike-Green-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Full-bike-Green-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Full-bike-Green-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Full-bike-Green-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Lichen Green Gloss</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-full-bike-black-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-full-bike-black-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike full bike black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-full-bike-black-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-full-bike-black-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-full-bike-black-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-full-bike-black-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Dark Star Matte</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $3,999<br />Colors: Dark Star Matte &amp; Lichen Green Gloss<br />Sizes: S, M, L, and XL</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Geo-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"982\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Geo-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Trek Bikes FX+7 City eBike in the black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Geo-jpg.webp 982w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Geo-297x173.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Geo-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Trek-Bikes-FX7-City-eBike-Geo-768x448.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out more details on the Trek FX+7 and all of the other bikes Trek offers by hitting the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/\" target=\"_blank\">TrekBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-fx7-lightweight-city-ebike-wireless-smartphone-charging/\">Meet the New Trek FX+7, a Lightweight City eBike That Offers Wireless Smartphone Charging</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1f943517475a6298d34dee242754ddd2461e44917e970fc53bbe38d067c580ce","category":"Cycling"}
