{"title":"Apple, Appealing €500M DMA Fine, Contends It Made a Series of Proposals to the European Commission Throughout 2024 but Did Not Receive Feedback","link":"https://www.politico.eu/article/apple-to-appeal-e500m-digital-fine-over-eus-silence-in-compliance-talks/","date":1747340622000,"content":"\n<p>Jacob Parry, reporting last week for Politico:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made\ndozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users\nhave asked for,” said Apple spokesperson Emma Wilson. “Despite\ncountless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal\nposts every step of the way.”</p>\n\n<p>These public comments echo concerns the company raised directly\nwith the Commission.</p>\n\n<p>According to correspondence seen by Politico, Apple offered last\nsummer <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=szrqxadx\">to drop its rules</a> on how app developers can\ncommunicate with users, but was told by the Commission to hold\noff, pending feedback from developers.</p>\n\n<p>By late September and following a round of consultations with\nApple critics like Spotify, Match Group and Epic Games, executives\nat the U.S.-based firm began worrying that a lack of feedback from\nthe Commission meant it was teeing up a potential fine and\nnoncompliance decision.</p>\n\n<p>In an October 2024 letter sent to senior officials in DG Connect\nand DG Competition, and seen by Politico, an Apple executive\ncomplained that the Commission’s case teams had “made clear” that\nthen-Commissioner Margrethe Vestager intended to issue a decision\nwith a “potentially significant fine.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, it sounds like the European Commission worked backwards to fining Apple last year in a similar way to how Apple <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/gonzales_rogers_apple_app_store_ruling\">worked backwards to arrive at a 27 percent</a> commission on web transactions initiated in apps from the App Store.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/15/apple-ec-proposals-feedback\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b41ba48beac0eb3fa0dee704e71081ef3047cf4ab901d15dd3a221a34810465a","category":"Tech"}
