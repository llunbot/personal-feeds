He continues to expect the next Mac mini to feature a \"revamped\" design, in line with his previous reporting that said the new model will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/mac-mini-redesign-rumor/\">nearly as small as an Apple TV and gain two front-facing USB-C ports</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not entirely clear if Apple plans to hold an online event this month, like its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/\">\"Scary Fast\" event on October 30 last year</a>, or if the new Macs will be announced with Apple Newsroom press releases only like the iPad mini 7. If there is an event this month, Apple would likely invite the media to watch it online very soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said the new Macs will be accompanied by \"USB-C accessories,\" but this wording is vague. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris recently discovered code references to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/apple-new-magic-mouse-trackpad-keyboard/\">new versions of the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard</a>, and the accessories will likely switch from Lightning to USB-C alongside the new iMac. In the EU, a regulation requiring USB-C as a common charging port goes into effect later this year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/22/gurman-says-m4-macs-launch-very-soon/\">Gurman: New MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini Models With M4 Chips Launching 'Very Soon'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-macbook-pro-imac-and-mac-mini-models-with-m4-chips-launching-very-soon.2440689/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7d344b2638f4e9ae911b225194db7df266d01737b54e5251647db65b3f9ca0e","category":"Apple"}
