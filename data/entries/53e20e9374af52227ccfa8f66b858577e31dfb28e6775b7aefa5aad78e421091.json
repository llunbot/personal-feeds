We’ve all forgotten a password from time to time, and in most cases forgetting the password isn’t too traumatic because we can request a reset via email or another way. But losing your Apple ID password (also known as your “iCloud password”) is one case where forgetting it can be both devastating and complicated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Apple ID is the king of all your passwords where your Apple computers, your iPhones, iPads, Apple TV, and other devices are concerned. iPhone and Mac users have to enter their Apple ID details when buying an app, accessing iCloud email, and signing in to other Apple services. Generally speaking, this is the password that hooks you into your digital life with Apple NS Without access to your Apple account you could lose all your data, including treasured photographs, and any music and movies you might have purchased from Apple’s various stores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it happens. Perhaps you got confused when Apple made you change to a new password; perhaps you picked one that was just too complicated to remember, or maybe it’s just been a while since you last used it. Whatever the reason, forgetting the password to your Apple ID account can be a serious pain, so we’re going to explain how to reset it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have a lot of trouble remembering passwords take a look at our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668938/best-password-managers-2.html\">Best Password Managers</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get started, let’s quickly cover two slightly different scenarios. First, your password might not be working because it’s been locked by Apple for security reasons; perhaps an attempt has been made to hack it. Should this happen to you, try this tutorial: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671717/how-to-unlock-an-apple-id-thats-locked-or-disabled.html\" target=\"_self\">How to unlock a disabled Apple ID</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you might have bought an iPhone, iPad, or other Apple device second-hand, or inherited it from a relative, then found that the old password and Apple ID haven’t been disassociated from it. In this case you need to ask the previous owner to remove the device from their Apple iCloud account, which they can do by using the Find My app, or going to <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/find\" target=\"_blank\">icloud.com/find</a>, logging in and removing the old device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were hoping that you can just ask Apple for help hacking that forgotten Apple ID be prepared for disappointment: Apple cannot recover or reset the password in any circumstances. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, all is not lost, it is possible to reset your Apple ID, and the good news is that over the years Apple has simplified this process and, as long as you’ve set up two-factor authentication, changing your Apple ID password should be very simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: Once you’ve changed your Apple ID password you will need to update it in the iCloud settings in any Apple devices you own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to reset your Apple ID password using your email</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be able to easily reset your Apple ID Password using your registered email and phone number if you visit <a href=\"https://iforgot.apple.com\">iforgot.apple.com</a>, Apple’s website specifically designed for this purpose. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need to know the email and phone number associated with your Apple ID. You also need either the password for your Mac, or Face ID, Touch ID or your numerical passcode for your iPhone or iPad depending on the device you use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://iforgot.apple.com\">iforgot.apple.com</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your email address on file for your Apple ID account and type the captcha code. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your phone number.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ll receive a notification on your devices (such as your iPhone, iPad or Mac). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the notification on the device of your choice to allow for the password to be reset. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will need to authenticate with your device password (such as your face via Face ID, your fingerprint via Touch ID, or your numerical password, what ever you use to unlock that device).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter a new password. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Confirm the new password for your Apple ID account.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Reset-Apple-ID-Password.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Reset your Apple ID Password by email\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Reset-Apple-ID-Password.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 827w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Reset-Apple-ID-Password.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 255w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Reset-Apple-ID-Password.jpg?resize=768%2C904&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"827\" height=\"973\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>After using iForgot.apple.com you can set a new password up for your Apple ID.</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Need some help coming up with a safe and secure password?

If you have been set up as the Recovery Contact this could be an easy fix. You would be able to get a one-time recovery code that can be used to unlock the account. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this only works if you have set up a Recovery Contact before the password was forgotten.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be a good idea to set this up for any parents, grandparents or children you might be able to help out in the future should they be in this situation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To set up Recovery Contacts you need to do the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: All the devices need to be running at minimum iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey. If you have older devices running older versions of the operating systems you need to remove them from Settings &gt; Apple ID. Click on any device in the list and you’ll be able to see what version of iOS it is running. You will need to remove old devices that you no longer use that can’t be updated beyond those operating systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Settings or System Settings (depending on whether you are on Mac or iPhone/iPad).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap/click on your Apple ID at the top of the screen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Sign-In &amp; Security (previously Password &amp; Security)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your Apple ID password if required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There are two Recovery Methods to choose from: Recovery Contacts &amp; Recovery Key.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Set up beside Recovery Contacts. You can now add someone you trust to be your Recovery Contact, they will need to have an Apple device. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Add Recovery Contact and follow the prompts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Recovery Contact set up the Recovery Contact will be able to get them to generate a code on their Apple device that can be used to get back into the Apple ID account.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a good idea to have more than one trusted Recovery Contact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to set up a Recovery Key </h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Recovery-Key-Apple-ID.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Recovery Key Apple ID\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Recovery-Key-Apple-ID.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 699w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Recovery-Key-Apple-ID.jpg?resize=300%2C119&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"699\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Screenshot</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also set up a Recovery Key to help you if you forget your Apple ID in the future. Again, this needs to be done in advance of you forgetting the password because you will need your Apple ID password to set it up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the steps above, but select Set Up beside Recovery Key instead of Recovery Contacts. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Enter your Apple ID password. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turn on Recovery Key. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you lose your recovery key and cannot access your devices, Apple will not be able to help you regain access to your account. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to add a Legacy Contact</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re setting this up, you could also add a Legacy Contact, which will be someone who can recover your account and access your data if you die. Your Legacy Contact will just need a copy of your death certificate to get access to your account.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings/Settings (depending on your device).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Sign-In &amp; Security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Legacy Contact.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click Add.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add multiple contacts here. Your Legacy Contact will have access to and be able to download your data, including photos, videos and notes, after your death. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What if you forget your email address?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with your password, you will need to enter the email address you use for your Apple ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to do if you have forgotten which email address is tied to your Apple ID. Luckily, there’s a quick way to find out which address you need. You just need to find a device that is already signed into your Apple ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>On an iPad or iPhone</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Settings and tap your name at the top of the page. If you’re logged in here you will see the email associated with your Apple ID under your name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You may also see the email address listed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Messages &gt; Send &amp; Receive, or Settings &gt; Apps &gt; FaceTime.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>On a Mac or PC</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to System Settings and click your name card at the top. Again you should see your Apple ID email address if you’re logged in.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you aren’t logged in here you may find the email by opening FaceTime, then clicking the FaceTime dropdown menu and selecting Settings. Similarly, you could try checking Mail, or Messages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Another way to find your Apple ID is to open the Music app and check for previous purchases. Find a purchase, right-click and choose Get Info then File. You may see the email address beside your name.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Online</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you fail to find your Apple ID after trying those methods, you will need to visit the Apple ID page online at <a href=\"https://appleid.apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">appleid.apple.com</a>. Below the boxes for Apple ID and Password, click ‘Forgotten your password?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enter the wrong email address, you can try again with a different one until the email address is recognized. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a related topic, here’s what to do if you need <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671278/how-to-change-the-admin-password-on-a-mac.html\">to change the admin password on a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"53e20e9374af52227ccfa8f66b858577e31dfb28e6775b7aefa5aad78e421091","category":"Apple"}
