And now we have Cat Royale, a \"multispecies\" live installation in which three cats regularly \"played\" with a robot over 12 days, carefully monitored by human operators. Created by computer scientists from the University of Nottingham in collaboration with artists from a group called Blast Theory, the installation debuted at the World Science Festival in Brisbane, Australia, last year and is now a touring exhibit.

This involved consideration of many elements, including the design of the enclosure, the robot, and its underlying systems, the various roles of the humans-in-the-loop, and, of course, the selection of the cats.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024062#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024062&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d5622db28072507fccc10a80cc59c9b9a5728538a6d630f67dc955fca6cdf85","category":"Tech"}
