Apple executives and product managers are expected to take the virtual stage to reveal new products and talk about what consumers should expect from the company in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>As usual, we'll be liveblogging the event and all the announcements as they unfold.</p>\n<p>As we noted in our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/what-to-expect-from-apples-september-14-california-streaming-event/\">roundup</a> shortly after the date was announced, the focus will almost certainly be on a new lineup of iPhones to follow up last year's iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. We're expecting phones with overall similar designs and with the same screen sizes: 5.4- and 6.1-inch versions of the standard flagship iPhone, and 6.1- and 6.7-inch version of the Pro.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793572#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793572&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"569ccace35129fb7bc471b38e4716a5643ee786399e8bd35d1e1f90b589fc9eb","category":"Tech"}
