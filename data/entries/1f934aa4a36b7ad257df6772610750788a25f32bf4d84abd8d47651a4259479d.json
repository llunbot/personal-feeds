As part of the agreement, which still needs to be approved by a judge, Apple has made several concessions that will change the way developers can sell subscriptions and in-app purchases, including allowing developers to promote outside payment options free of Apple’s fees in correspondence with customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not all developers are happy with the moves. As part of the agreement, Apple also said it will be keeping the App Store terms the same for the next three years, which means Apple’s 30-percent cut for developers making over a million dollars a year stays in place. It’s also not allowing developers to offer alternative payment methods inside apps. Here’s what developers had to say after Apple announced the agreement:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>An agreement for one</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overcast developer Marco Arment has been one of the most vocal critics of Apple’s App Store terms over the years and he doesn’t think Apple is giving anything to developers in this agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>It’s so funny watching Apple PR’s song and dance, embarrassingly patting itself on the back, after yielding basically zero ground on the App Store’s most anticompetitive rules.<br /><br />You know this changes nothing. We know this changes nothing. Who are you performing for?</p>— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1431058287282298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-354291-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">August 27, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><h3>Smoke and mirrors</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer Ryan Jones pored over the terms of the agreement and concluded that Apple didn’t really change much, despite headlines to the contrary.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>19. For the record, what I want *for the ecosystem*.<br /><br />– Apple to act quick, courts will f us all<br />– 15/20%<br />– no conquesting<br />– no sideloading<br />– no alt payments<br />– can’t link to payments, can mention<br />– “report fraud” button<br />– punishment for rule breaking<br />– universal paywall<br /><br />🙏🧡🍎</p>— Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1431104120509829124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-354291-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">August 27, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><h3>A different perspective</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tweetbot developer Paul Hadad put the agreement in terms we can all understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Breaking: Apple has settled the butterfly keyboard lawsuit!<br />Key Concessions:<br />1.
