With weight-conscious trail, enduro, and eMTB riders in mind, Prologo has designed the new W850 saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prologo creates their Proxim saddles in collaboration with the University Politecnico di Milano, and with feedback from their six sponsored DH and enduro teams (including GT, Atherton Bikes, and Lapierre). Prologo offers two saddle lines; Their Proxim Sport line prioritizes comfort, offering wider platforms and more padding. The Proxim Performance line features compact dimensions and technology oriented toward competition use. The new Proxim W850 is a high-end product in the Performance category. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prologo Proxim W850 Saddle:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Proxim W850 \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rails.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At 155g, the new W850 is the lightest Proxim saddle available but is still strong and durable. To achieve that weight, the W850 features a long-fiber carbon-reinforced base, which is tuned to balance stiffness, shock resistance, and vibration absorption. It also uses Prologo’s Nack nano carbon fiber oversized rails. Made from carbon fiber, Kevlar, and aluminum filaments, these rails offer rigidity and strength at a low weight.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure some of you are wondering why you need to shave grams from an eMTB, whose motors compensate for their extra bulk. Prologo did say the saddle is ideal for ‘light eMTBs’ like the Specialized Levo SL, but I still had to chuckle at their claim that running this super light saddle will help increase the range of your bike’s battery! I’m sure they mean it would help if you paired it with several other significant weight-saving upgrades…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Proxim W850 back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-back.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The W850 features an ergonomic V shape inspired by the popular and on/off-road versatile Prologo Dimension saddle. Prologo has improved the anatomical center area of the W850 to provide a larger support surface for the ischial bones and better rider stability, especially on rough terrain. Its compact size of 245x143mm and semi-round shape are designed for aggressive seating positions and maximum pedaling efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Proxim W850 floating\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-angle-right.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this saddle’s high-performance features, comfort is of course a concern too; Prologo has used several of its existing tech features to ensure this. First up, their MSS (Multi Sector System) padding uses different EVA foams in different areas of the seat. The front portion uses a softer foam, while the rear has a firmer, more supportive foam to stabilize the ischial bones.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Proxim W850 padding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-rear-half.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>PAS (Perineal Area System) is the name of the center relief channel that eliminates pressure on your most sensitive parts, and Prologo’s Grip Cover provides a little friction to help keep your butt in the right position while you ride, even in wet conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Proxim W850 side profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Prologo-proxim-W850-side-left.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Photos by @mattiaragni</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prologo Proxim W850 saddle is available now online and at Prologo dealers.
