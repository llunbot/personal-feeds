This offers new openings for Apple as it pursues its strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing, which is mainly operated by its assembly partner Foxconn. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple seeks to diversify its supply chain in the face of geopolitical tensions, economic slowdown, and other risks such as production disruptions caused by China's COVID lockdowns. With production shifts already opened in Vietnam and India, Apple is exploring further expansion in Southeast Asia. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"I think the investment ability in Indonesia is endless. There are many great places to invest, and we're investing. We believe in the country,\" Cook added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe meeting came shortly after Cook's visit to Vietnam, where he met with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. In Hanoi, Cook outlined plans to deepen Apple's investment and increase expenditures with local suppliers, reinforcing the company's commitment to enhancing its presence in the region.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/apple-considers-manufacturing-base-indonesia/\">Apple Considers Expanding Manufacturing Base to Indonesia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considers-expanding-manufacturing-base-to-indonesia.2424371/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f20e4b3751a787b6e212a81d640c562d45fb2eeac9d343b6afb0951d4230867b","category":"Apple"}
