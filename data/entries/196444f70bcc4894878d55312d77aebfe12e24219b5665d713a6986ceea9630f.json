Both the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6/\">iPad mini 6</a> and the ‌iPad‌ 9 are available for pre-order starting today, with orders up and live following the conclusion of the event.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-purple.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPad‌ 9, which replaces the eighth-generation version, continues to be priced at $329. It features an A13 chip, up to 256GB of storage, and a new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera that supports Center Stage for video calls. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCompared to prior versions, it includes sRGB support and a True Tone display, with no improvements to the rear camera. It continues to feature thick bezels and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> Home button. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPad mini 6‌, priced starting at $499, features a much more significant redesign. The new ‌iPad mini‌ is basically a smaller version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> with an 8.3-inch all-display design, slim bezels, and a ‌Touch ID‌ power button. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt too features a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera with Center Stage, and it can be purchased with up to 256GB of storage. It's equipped with Apple's latest and fastest A15 chip, which is also the chip used in the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> models. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPad mini‌ comes in unique new colors that include pink, purple, space gray, and starlight, while the ‌iPad‌ 9 is available in space gray and silver. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBoth the ‌iPad mini 6‌ and the ‌iPad‌ 9 models will be delivered to customers starting on September 24, which is also the launch date for the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/apple-ipad-mini-6-ipad-9-pre-orders-live/\">Apple Now Accepting Pre-Orders for New iPad Mini 6 and iPad 9</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-accepting-pre-orders-for-new-ipad-mini-6-and-ipad-9.2310775/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GTRkbkv2uD4:N6gOd578x3c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GTRkbkv2uD4:N6gOd578x3c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GTRkbkv2uD4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"196444f70bcc4894878d55312d77aebfe12e24219b5665d713a6986ceea9630f","category":"Apple"}
