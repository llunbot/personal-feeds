DRM? Over the weekend the Internet got wind of <a href=\"https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/tree/main\">this proposal</a> for a \"Web Environment Integrity API. \" The <a href=\"https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md\">explainer</a> is authored by four Googlers, including at least one person on Chrome's \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/googles-privacy-sandbox-advertising-system-arrives-on-android-in-beta/\">Privacy Sandbox</a>\" team, which is responding to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/google-delays-death-of-tracking-cookies-again-wants-more-time-for-testing/\">death of tracking cookies</a> by building a user-tracking ad platform right into the browser.</p>\n<p>The intro to the Web Integrity API starts out: \"Users often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in. This trust may assume that the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data and intellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it.\"</p>\n<p>The goal of the project is to learn more about the person on the other side of the web browser, ensuring they aren't a robot and that the browser hasn't been modified or tampered with in any unapproved ways. The intro says this data would be useful to advertisers to better count ad impressions, stop social network bots, enforce intellectual property rights, stop cheating in web games, and help financial transactions be more secure.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956109#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956109&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9409f8bc6f60ba5ef897379fd188d877a2084930c18abec19918652f0e68179","category":"Tech"}
