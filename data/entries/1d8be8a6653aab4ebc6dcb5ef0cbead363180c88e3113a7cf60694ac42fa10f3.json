Reissued on their 10th anniversary, six years ago the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/10th-anniversary-limited-edition-urge-endur-o-matic-real-jet-mountain-bike-helmets/\" target=\"_blank\">RealJet</a> offered extra coverage and retro appeal. But it couldn’t compete with the latest helmets on pretty much any real performance characteristics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, they decided to build a much more modern 3/4-shell enduro &amp; all-mountain helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Urge Rascas lightweight eco-friendly 3/4-shell mountain bike eMTB helmet, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_trail-riding-with-goggles-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Urge)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their new Rascas is fully-vented for maximum airflow and plenty of summer ride cooling with 3 front-facing, 3 top &amp; 4 rear vents, plus large ear openings. Then it gets Urge’s ERT pads to isolate the rider’s head from rotational &amp; linear impact forces, even at lower speeds. And tops it off with a soft padded and moisture-wicking bamboo lining for comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it does all that at impressive weights less than half of the old RealJet. From a claimed 420-480g depending on size, this could be one of the lightest 3/4 shell enduro helmets out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Eco-friendly construction</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Urge Rascas lightweight eco-friendly 3/4-shell mountain bike eMTB helmet, jumping\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_jumping-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Often one of the most unique and interesting features of many Urge helmets, is their use of alternative, more environmentally-friendly materials than we are used to seeing – while still providing safe &amp; affordable protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Urge Rascas lightweight eco-friendly 3/4-shell mountain bike eMTB helmet, recycled content\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Urge-Rascas-lightweight-eco-friendly-three-quarter-shell-mountain-bike-eMTB-helmet_environmentally-friendly-recycled-materials-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest bit of eco-friendly tech in this all-new Urge Rascas helmet is its fully recycled polycarbonate shell.
