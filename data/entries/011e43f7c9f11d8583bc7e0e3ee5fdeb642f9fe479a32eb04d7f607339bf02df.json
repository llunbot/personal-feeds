In a refreshing act of cooperation and environmental stewardship, dozens of brands voluntarily channel money to fund the transport of spent batteries to special recycling centers. Those centers can reclaim as much as 95% of a battery’s metals while making a fraction of the impact that mining would. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a> takes us from a tiny lithium atom to a 5-million-square-foot recycling plant, with just a few stops on the way to discuss state and federal laws. </i></p>\n<p><i>We’d like to thank <a href=\"https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwiKxf-X6NKMAxUuI0QIHavAGdIYABADGgJkeg&amp;co=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwnui_BhDlARIsAEo9GuuUb_pqHQsjd3JXfsnvr8zeqvLAlvQ0Z1fV3H8Gmd6A-ZlbFI6Qs4caAttjEALw_wcB&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESVOD2VgI4EQuifWK5spkviW3gYpmh73EjFD7Ezx2JjbNCToFhQ_ep6GlKVTG6H5SLeOrtyv90Kk1XFuMAxf1KpKBEUKz9mCGVT5ygEOiDSZEIu_MJkw&amp;sig=AOD64_2F_3wscUXpjtSlWpHBZs4wiU5yGw&amp;q&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjdoPqX6NKMAxUHD0QIHWZJDcUQ0Qx6BAgJEAE\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe</a> for sponsoring these stories.</i><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Alessandro Volta invented the first battery in the year 1800, but it would take nearly a century before commercial batteries would be mass-produced. That was in 1896, which also happened to be the year the first incandescent flashlight was developed. More than a half-century later, the 1950s brought us the transistor radio. Then in the 1970s came the pocket calculator, and the first “brick” cell phone kicked off the go-go 1980s. But for all the elder millennials out there, portable battery-powered gadgets didn’t really matter until 1989.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-9.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>At the time, the Nintendo Game Boy was arguably the most important digital device ever made. It was the perfect capstone to the first century of handheld electronics. And it was much more exciting than any brick … unless we’re talking about Tetris. But it absolutely <i>devoured</i> AA batteries, always going through four at a time. That’s what introduced many families to rechargeables. Or if it wasn’t the Game Boy, it was the Walkman, or the Discman, or the compact video camera. In the 1990s, personal electronics were getting better and <i>cheaper</i> than they’d ever been. That meant a lot of rechargeable batteries were being manufactured, sold, and discarded when they inevitably wore out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>So, in 1996, Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/rcra/mercury-containing-and-rechargeable-battery-management-act-public-law-104-142\" target=\"_blank\">Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act,</a> also known as “The Battery Act.” It required rechargeable batteries (and devices with non-removable batteries) to be uniformly labeled, displaying that they must be disposed of properly. It also made it easier for states and organizations to facilitate proper disposal by easing expensive regulations around transporting spent batteries. It would also set up channels for battery manufacturers to help <i>pay for</i> that collection and transport. But this wasn’t forced upon the battery industry. It was actually their idea.</p>\n<p>The Battery Act was spearheaded by the Portable Recycle Battery Association, a then-new trade organization. These were huge corporations committing a lot of effort and a lot of money towards limiting their own environmental impact. This wasn’t just about putting labels on packaging. The PRBA ultimately wanted The Battery Act to make it easier for producers and consumers to recycle batteries. Sure, it made sense from a business perspective for the PRBA to codify an ever-changing patchwork of state regulations. But by and large, they went <em>with</em> those regulations, not <em>against</em> them. Energizer, Panasonic, Sanyo, and other major manufacturers saw where some US states were trending, and where much of Europe had already gone.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-11.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-11.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>To handle logistics, the PRBA founded the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, now known as <a href=\"https://www.call2recycle.org/\">Call2Recycle</a>. For 30 years, Call2Recycle has been setting up free collection sites for used batteries, battery packs, and devices with non-removable batteries like phones and tablets. They then channel funds to transport those batteries to recyclers. Collection sites are usually in major hardware stores or other large retailers, and according to Call2Recycle, 85% of Americans live within 10 miles of one.</p>\n<p>The effort is funded by battery and device manufacturers, and there is no direct charge to taxpayers, the consumer, or the collector when spent batteries are received. It’s a pretty well-oiled machine, so when bike-industry trade organization, <a href=\"https://www.peopleforbikes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">People For Bikes,</a> wanted to follow the PRBA’s model for safely collecting e-bike batteries, they partnered with Call2Recycle.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2020/01/morgan-taylor-big-easy-radavist-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2020/01/morgan-taylor-big-easy-radavist-15.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2020/01/morgan-taylor-big-easy-radavist-15.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2020/01/morgan-taylor-big-easy-radavist-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2024_Salsa_Confluence_Ebike_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2024_Salsa_Confluence_Ebike_Review-14.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2024_Salsa_Confluence_Ebike_Review-14.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2024_Salsa_Confluence_Ebike_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“When we’re talking about logistics and compliance around transporting e-bike batteries through the network, it’s different than when you’re dealing with regular portable batteries,” explains Maggie Long, High Energy Programs Manager at Call2Recycle. “The e-bike battery recycling program was really the organization’s first launch into an industry vertical that encompasses what we consider medium format batteries, which are over 300 Watt-hours and under 25 pounds.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Under their crispy candy coating, modern e-bike batteries are just a series of small connected cells like jumbo AA’s. But when a bunch of them are soldered together, the risk of fire (or a “thermal event,” as the battery industry calls it) will increase. In turn, that requires increased safety protocols and increased expense for storage, care, and transportation. And of course, they can cause increased harm and waste if they end up in a landfill. But The Battery Act doesn’t cover medium-format batteries. Until very recently, there were no centralized efforts to deal with them.</p>\n<p>As more and more e-bike batteries start to wear out, that’s going to be a real problem. For example, Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the US, in the wealthiest state. But LA’s hazardous-waste collection sites are not capable of accepting medium-format batteries. They’ll tell you to call the manufacturer, who may or may not be able to help you. Meanwhile, E-bikes have been the industry’s fastest-growing category here in the US. This situation is similar to the personal electronics boom of the ‘80s and ‘90s that inspired The Battery Act. And bike brands have gotten together to create a similar program.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“Whoever’s selling the product into the market, whether to a retailer or a consumer, is paying a fee per battery,” says Long. “That allows Call2Recycle to stand up an accessible collection network. We have engineered recycling kits, we have special permits, we have relationships with carriers and downstream vendors that help us with this operation.” Side note: Call2Recycle also provides safety equipment and training to shops for fire prevention, which is supported by the same revenue stream that funds collection. You can’t drop an e-bike battery into the Call2Recycle collection box at your local Home Depot. Instead, you take it to a participating retailer, who has an approved box on-hand to ship it to a recycler.  And the recycler that receives many of Call2Recycle’s e-bike batteries is a five-million-square-foot campus in northern Nevada called <a href=\"https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/\">Redwood Materials.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Images courtesy of Redwood Materials</em></p>\n<p>This is a very expensive facility that does the very difficult job of processing hazardous waste. You’d think they’d charge a fee for taking your trash batteries off your hands. But in fact, depending on commodity pricing, the market sometimes allows recycling plants to actually <i>pay</i> for medium-format batteries. The funding that supports Call2Recycle doesn’t pay for the recycling itself. It pays for collection and transportation, as well as battery-safety supplies for retailers. And they’ve made it surprisingly affordable. It’s $15 per e-bike, collected at the point of sale.  We talked to Justin Clements at Kona Bicycles about how that works. “For every e-bike Kona imports and sells into North America, we report these to Call2Recycle, and there is a flat fee per e-bike sold that is built into the cost,” Clements explains. “This shows up as a line item as an ‘eco fee.'”</p>\n<p>Some participating brands don’t list the fee as a line item, and instead build it into the price of the e-bike or battery. Either way, it’s effectively the consumer who pays, not the bike brand. But really, what’s so inspiring is that <em>anyone</em> pays. None of this is required by law. At least, not yet. “Right now, the e-bike battery recycling program is voluntary,” Maggie Long tells us. “There is no currently enforced legislation mandating producers to have an end of life solution for these products.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-59.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-59.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-59.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-59.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Tern-Orox-e-Cargo-Bike-Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Tern-Orox-e-Cargo-Bike-Review-27.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Tern-Orox-e-Cargo-Bike-Review-27.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Tern-Orox-e-Cargo-Bike-Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Because it’s an opt-in program, Call2Recycle’s e-bike-battery-collection service only covers its member brands.  They tend to be mainstays like Kona, Trek, Cannondale, Marin, etc. Most of the bike companies you might think of <a href=\"https://www.call2recycle.org/e-bikes/participating-e-bike-brands/\" target=\"_blank\">are on the list.</a> Battery and motor manufacturers like Bosch also partner with Call2Recycle, and work behind the scenes with bike brands, consumers, and governments around the world to increase access to battery recycling. But motor brands aren’t involved in the same way as bike brands because they aren’t the ones ultimately putting the batteries onto the consumer market.</p>\n<p>There are also less established brands that aren’t part of the Call2Recycle program, but do have a plan. For example, Rad Power Bikes partners with Redwood Materials directly and handles collection and shipping at their dealers, though that network is nowhere near as vast as Call2Recycle’s. As for the lower-tier brands that aren’t funding collection efforts at all, there is a slowly rising tide of states that will soon require it of them. Illinois and Vermont will have laws taking effect in 2026, with a few others in the works. It’s cool to see corporations getting out ahead of environmental trends. You know what’s also cool? Science.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-08.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-08.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Images courtesy of Redwood Materials</em></p>\n<p>Over time, all rechargeable batteries lose capacity. That’s true of old lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries, as well as the Lithium-ion batteries that are ubiquitous on modern e-bikes. They provide power by pulling an electron off a lithium atom and passing it through the device’s circuit, while the now-ionized lithium molecule passes from the anode to the cathode in search of an electron to replace the one it lost. Charging the battery reverses that process. For the purposes of this story, let’s just say it’s that simple, but <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4-1psMHSpKs?si=tMYSQN--bPhYTeAz\" target=\"_blank\">here’s a great video</a> if you want to know more. As you pass the lithium ions through all the structures and soups within the battery, some of those ions will inevitably get stuck. After hundreds or <i>thousands</i> of cycles, more and more ions will be stuck, the battery will no longer reach full charge. But all the materials are still there. They just need to be separated.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-09-e1744468029363.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-09-e1744468029363.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-09-e1744468029363.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-09-e1744468029363.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Images courtesy of Redwood Materials</em></p>\n<p>First, the battery has to be discharged to remove any reactivity, which is often done through extreme heat or extreme cold. But some recyclers like the above-mentioned Redwood Materials actually spend the residual charge in their collected batteries to help power the facility. Then, battery packs like the ones in cameras, power tools, or e-bikes have to be physically disassembled. Once stripped to their bare cells, they are mechanically crushed or shredded into a provocatively named substance called “black mass,” which contains many of the active ingredients needed to make a new lithium-ion battery, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory</em></p>\n<p>There are several ways to break black mass down to those core chemical components. It may be done by a specialized third party, or it may be done in vertically integrated recyclers that do both the pre-processing and the metal extractions under one “roof.” But it all happens upstream of the battery manufacturers themselves. Sometimes, it’s done through pyrometallurgy, which means just what it sounds like it means. They’re burned in a smelter to melt off and collect some of the metals like cobalt and nickel. That would seem like a dirty process, and it’s not <em>not</em> dirty Eric Frederickson, Vice President of Operations at Call2Recycle tells us it’s not that simple.</p>\n<p><span>“Black mass can go to a nickel mine and introduced into the same process that is used to recover nickel and cobalt from ore,” Frederickson explains. “</span><span>That smelter isn’t going to go away if all of the black mass goes to a hydrometallurgical recycler.”</span></p>\n<p>Hydrometallurgy is another way to break down black mass, and it also means just what it sounds like. It’s the practice of dissolving and collecting the materials in a liquid. Of course, the details of that process are trade secrets proprietary to each recycler, but we probably wouldn’t be able to explain it if they told us. Apparently, it works really well. Many existing recyclers, including Redwood Materials, claim to be capturing over 95% of critical minerals. And if they do it right, they can make some primo shit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/ARGONNE-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Argonne National Laboratory</a> has long been an authority on energy science, and that now includes battery recycling. They made test batteries out of minerals produced at the Redwood Materials facility. In their testing, Argonne found that there was “identical cycle-life performance, discharge capacity and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coulomb#:~:text=variants%20or%20coulombic,or%20repulsion%20between%20charged%20particles\" target=\"_blank\">Coulombic</a> efficiency between cathode materials made from metal-sulfates from virgin mined metals and those synthesized from recycled materials by Redwood.”</p>\n<p>However impressive that sounds, it makes sense. Even virgin materials were never “pure,” so there’s always some refining necessary to extract the necessary elements.  There does happen to be a fundamentally different approach, where some of the battery’s structure or “morphology” is maintained, which Frederickson briefly touches on.  “It was already a cathode-active material, and then when you rejuvenate it to make it a fresh cathode active material, it more happily and more consistently goes back to the morphology that you started with.” But that’s still a developing science. The dominant approach to lithium-ion battery recycling is plain and simple logic. “Metal is metal,” Frederickson says. “Metal is infinitely recyclable.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-55.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-55.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-55.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-55.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-34.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-34.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That’s great, of course, because it at least means that the scientific fundamentals of battery recycling are sound. But it also has some pretty broad economic ramifications, even if they may take a while for them to impact the bike industry. The numbers are a bit murky right now because many of these raw materials are in a bit of a price slump due to factors like overproduction and falling EV demand. But this closed-loop approach to battery recycling makes domestic battery manufacturing much more feasible.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that Germany or Switzerland or the US will be manufacturing e-bike batteries domestically, and shipping them to bike-assembly plants in Asia. But there’s potentially a world where batteries are added in a bike’s destination country. That would give more countries more control over battery manufacturing, which has been rapidly concentrated in China for decades. Plus, shipping e-bikes without batteries is safer and cheaper. Anyway, stranger things have happened. And these are strange times.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/REDWOOD-BATTERY-RECYCLING-RADAVIST-FOR-A-CHANGE-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image courtesy of Redwood Materials</em></p>\n<p>Then there’s the question of whether recycling a battery is any more environmentally friendly than mining and processing fresh ingredients. After all, recycling requires a lot of chemicals. So, this isn’t necessarily a simple yes or no question … But yes. Recycling is much <em>much</em> better. According to <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/01/recycling-lithium-ion-batteries-cuts-emissions-and-strengthens-supply-chain#:~:text=According%20to%20new%20research%2C%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%2C,for%20new%20metals%20%E2%80%93%20batteries%20are%20recycled.&amp;text=Recycling%20lithium%2Dion%20batteries%20to%20recover%20their%20critical,University%20lifecycle%20analysis%20published%20in%20Nature%20Communications.\">a 2025 Stanford University study</a>, recycling batteries emits 58% to 81% less greenhouse gases, uses 72% to 88% less water, and uses 77% to 89% less energy than extracting virgin minerals. And to go back to Redwood Materials, they produce few enough emissions that they see on the horizon the possibility to build a “zero-liquid-emissions campus,” except for what flows out of their kitchens and bathrooms.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>And this is only getting started. Globally, electric vehicle adoption is still growing. So, innovations in recycling will continue to grow alongside it. And the electric bike market took a hit just like the rest of the industry, but it’s still booming compared to where it stood five years ago. Even in the US, it’s no longer a debate that an e-bike can be a viable car replacement in many situations. It’s comforting to know that all this progress is being accompanied by thoughtful environmental stewardship. It’s even more comforting to know it may not have been possible if it weren’t for the Game Boy.</p>\n<p><i>We’d like to thank <a href=\"https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwiKxf-X6NKMAxUuI0QIHavAGdIYABADGgJkeg&amp;co=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwnui_BhDlARIsAEo9GuuUb_pqHQsjd3JXfsnvr8zeqvLAlvQ0Z1fV3H8Gmd6A-ZlbFI6Qs4caAttjEALw_wcB&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESVOD2VgI4EQuifWK5spkviW3gYpmh73EjFD7Ezx2JjbNCToFhQ_ep6GlKVTG6H5SLeOrtyv90Kk1XFuMAxf1KpKBEUKz9mCGVT5ygEOiDSZEIu_MJkw&amp;sig=AOD64_2F_3wscUXpjtSlWpHBZs4wiU5yGw&amp;q&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjdoPqX6NKMAxUHD0QIHWZJDcUQ0Qx6BAgJEAE\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe</a> for sponsoring these stories.</i></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/e-bike-battery-recycling/\">For a Change: E-Bike Battery Recycling Is a Self-Funded Marvel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"011e43f7c9f11d8583bc7e0e3ee5fdeb642f9fe479a32eb04d7f607339bf02df","category":"Cycling"}
