Both have an aviator-like silhouette, but the Westcraft design is rounded and the Eastcraft design is squarer in shape, bearing a passing resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/oakley-cycling-sunglasses/\">Oakley</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/sunglasses-and-goggles/sunglasses/oakley-sutro-sunglasses-review/\">Sutro</a> design. Prices start from £169.99 (pricing in other territories is TBC).</p>\n<p>Unusually, the models can be used with both a singular shield lens or separate dual lenses. The glasses’ V-latch locking mechanism across the bridge of the nose secures both lens types, and contributes to a distinctive look that is unmistakably 100% in style.</p>\n<p>The glasses also have removable side ‘shields’, which 100% says give extra protection from the elements. The Eastcraft will be offered in four different frame/lens spec combinations, while the Westcraft will be offered in five different guises.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 100% Eastcrafts are performance models, but can be worn casually too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>100% / Pauline Ballet</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Novel characteristics aside, the Eastcraft and Westcraft models adopt many of the features 100% includes as standard on its glasses.
