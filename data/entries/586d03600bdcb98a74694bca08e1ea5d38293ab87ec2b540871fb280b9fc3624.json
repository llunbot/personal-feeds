There’s now clearance for 33mm tyres, and new internal cable routing through the two-piece bar and stem improves front end aerodynamics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices start at £2,699 and head up to £11,999 for the pro-level Liv Langma Advanced SL 0.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

available at three carbon grades. Top is the pro-level Langma Advanced SL. The frame has an integrated seatmast rather than a separate seatpost, which Liv says increases compliance and improves aerodynamics while saving weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv’s one-piece front triangle moulding, Continuous Fiber Technology, and precise cutting of carbon layers are claimed to result in fewer carbon swatches and fewer joins to lower frame weight. Liv also uses lower weight paint on the Advanced SL bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv says that as a result the new Langma Advanced SL is 123.03g lighter than its predecessor. The Advanced Pro loses 44g and the Advanced 75g from the previous generation frames. It says that its testing shows that the Advanced SL frameset has 2.5% greater pedalling stiffness and 6.75% greater torsional stiffness, resulting in an 11.98% greater <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-frame-stiffness\" target=\"_blank\">stiffness-to-weight</a> than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/liv-langma-disc\" target=\"_blank\">2021 model Langma</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Liv claims to have improved the Langma’s aerodynamics, with the new frame, Contact SLR bar and Cadex Max 40 wheelsystem improving aerodynamics by 12.57 watts at 40kmh over the top spec bike’s predecessor at a range of wind <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-science-yaw-angles-explained\" target=\"_blank\">yaw angles</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two handlebar options across the Langma range: the top spec bikes have the carbon Liv Contact SLR, while lower priced bikes are equipped with the alloy Liv Contact SL. Both have a flare to the drops for control when sprinting and descending, while providing a more aero hand position when riding on the tops. Liv says that the handlebar design saves eight watts in its wind tunnel testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liv Langma Advanced specs and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2-970x728.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2-970x728.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2-1140x855.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/MY25-Langma-Advanced-2.jpeg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Liv Langma Advanced SL comes kitted out with either <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS</a> as the Advanced SL 0, priced at £11,999 / $12,500 / €12,500, or with Shimano Ultegra as the Advanced SL 1 priced at £8,999 / $n/a / €8,300.

It includes a separate aero seatpost.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three spec options: the Advanced Pro 0 is equipped with Shimano Ultegra and priced at £6,499 / $6,500 / €6,500, the Advanced Pro 1 can be bought with either SRAM Rival AXS for £4,999 / $n/a / €5,099 or Shimano 105 Di2 costing £4,899 / $n/a / €4,700.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Advanced frameset has both an Advanced grade frame and fork. It can be bought in Advanced 1 spec with Shimano 105 Di2, costing £3,199 / $n/a / €3,500 or the entry-level Advanced 2 with mechanical Shimano 105 costing £2,699 / $3,200 / €2,800.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Advanced Pro and Advanced grade frames are sold in five sizes from XXS to L.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/giant-propel-tcr-defy\">Giant Propel vs TCR vs Defy: The best Giant road bike in 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/liv-avail-2024\">Liv Avail sheds weight and gets more all-road with 38mm tyre clearance and extra squish</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/liv-enviliv-2023\">2023 Liv EnviLiv sheds weight and drag, ups tyre clearance to 30mm</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-history-giant-tcr\">The complete history of the Giant TCR</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/liv-langma-2024\">New Liv Langma has new carbon layup and cable integration to lower weight and improve aerodynamics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"586d03600bdcb98a74694bca08e1ea5d38293ab87ec2b540871fb280b9fc3624","category":"Cycling"}
