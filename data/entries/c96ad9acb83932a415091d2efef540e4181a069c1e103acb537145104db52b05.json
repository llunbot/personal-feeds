Based on their uneven appearance and their varied sizes, it seemed that these weren’t beads, but spindle whorls: a flywheel-like piece that makes a drop spindle spin faster and more steadily. The find is the oldest known evidence of a newfangled textile production technology called the drop spindle. But it may also have been a distant precursor to the wheel. According to archaeologists Talia Yashuv and Leore Grosman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, drop spindles work on the same mechanical principle as the earliest wheels, which show up on carts around 6,000 years ago during the Bronze Age.</p>\n<p>“Circular objects with a hollowed center connected to a bar make one of the most important inventions of all time,” write Yashuv and Grosman in their recent paper. “At the core of it all, the importance of the wheel and axle lies in a relatively simple rotational mechanism capable of transforming linear to rotary motion and vice versa.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/to-invent-the-wheel-did-people-first-have-to-invent-the-spindle/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/to-invent-the-wheel-did-people-first-have-to-invent-the-spindle/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
