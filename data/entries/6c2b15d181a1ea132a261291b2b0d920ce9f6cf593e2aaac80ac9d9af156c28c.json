But now that the first reviewers have gotten their hands on the device, we know a lot more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-WhZT02ubg\">YouTuber Dave2D</a>, who examined the internal parts of the iPhone 16e, the battery has a capacity of 3961mAh, nearly double that of the iPhone SE’s 2018 mAh battery. That’s not all that surprising, but what is surprising is how that compares to the rest of the iPhone lineup:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> 4685mAH</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> 3,582mAh</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> 4,674mAh</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16: </strong>3,561mAh</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16e:</strong> 3,961mAh</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Plus have larger batteries due to their larger screens, the iPhone 16e has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678413/iphone-battery-capacities-compared-all-iphones-battery-life-in-mah-and-wh.html\">the largest battery</a> Apple has ever put in a 6.1-inch iPhone. It’s substantially larger than the 3279mAh battery in the iPhone 14 and should mean the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro are due for a bump in battery capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the large battery and more efficient modem, early testing has shown the iPhone 16e offers incredible battery life that rivals the iPhone 16 Pro Max and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">easily lasts a full day</a>. We’ll be putting the iPhone 16e through our own testing soon and will be sharing our results—so stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678413/iphone-battery-capacities-compared-all-iphones-battery-life-in-mah-and-wh.html\">compare battery life, capacity, mah and watt hours for every iPhone</a> separately.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6c2b15d181a1ea132a261291b2b0d920ce9f6cf593e2aaac80ac9d9af156c28c","category":"Apple"}
