This makes it a perfect choice for vertiginous gravel climbs.</p>\n<p>Pete says the 1t steps on the first 7 cogs of his 10-44t cassette feel great, but the changes in cadence can be a bit choppy when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-ride-in-a-group/\">riding in a chain gang</a> (though he assures me he’s yet to be dropped when he has taken the bike out on group rides).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (20 of 2)\" title=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (9 of 15)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like many others, Pete really rates the feel of Campagnolo’s disc brakes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>He has no such issues when riding solo on the road – with a switch of tyres, this is Pete’s preferred road bike for winter riding.</p>\n<p>Like many others, Pete also loves the feel of Campagnolo’s disc brakes and the ergonomics of the Ekar shifters.</p>\n<h2>A road-inspired build with gravel touches</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (20 of 2)\" title=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (20 of 2)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pete prefers a low front end.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Pete favours a long and low position on the bike – though he could probably fit on a size-small frame, he prefers the look and feel of the XS bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Pete-Sampsons-gravel-Giant-TCR-15-of-15-0643635.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (20 of 2)\" title=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (15 of 15)\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Pete is currently riding with a Route Werks bar bag.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Pete-Sampsons-gravel-Giant-TCR-11-of-15-1c3c234.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (20 of 2)\" title=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (11 of 15)\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>This features an integrated computer mount.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Pete-Sampsons-gravel-Giant-TCR-6-of-15-a1fca6c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (20 of 2)\" title=\"Pete Sampson's gravel Giant TCR (6 of 15)\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The bag is perfect for longer gravel adventures.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The 36cm bars with inward-tilting levers add to his aero credentials, although they’re probably negated by the boxy Route Werks bar bag Pete has fitted to the bike.</p>\n<p>This neat bar bag attaches via a machined alloy clamp and features an integrated computer mount. While big enough to bring everything he needs for his comically long rides, sadly, we think it will be too small to accommodate Pete’s aforementioned dog.</p>\n<h2>Pete Sampson’s all-road Giant TCR Advanced specs</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Frameset:</strong> Giant TCR Advanced, XS</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Campagnolo Ekar, 44t chainring, 10-44t cassette</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Hunt Aerodynamicist 44</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Panaracer GravelKing SK, 32mm</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> Zipp Service Course SL, 130mm</li>\n<li><strong>Bars:</strong> Pro PLT Ergo Compact, 36cm</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Prologo Dimension Nack</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.7kg (inc pedals, bottle cages and computer mount)</li>\n</ul>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"40b6d1d34fbcf005f0fd16cdb773efffa55b0356593246c57e1d986c969d9c0c","category":"Cycling"}
