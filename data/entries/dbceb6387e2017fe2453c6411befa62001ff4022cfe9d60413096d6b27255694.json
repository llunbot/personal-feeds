{"title":"How to Watch Apple's 'Wonderlust' iPhone 15 Event on Tuesday, September 12","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wonderlust-iphone-15-event-sep-12/","date":1694442386000,"content":"Apple is hosting an online streaming event for the public and press on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">September 12, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time</a>. The company is expected to announce its new iPhone 15 lineup alongside an Apple Watch Series 9, an Apple Watch Ultra 2, and potentially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/iphone-15-apple-event-four-other-announcements/\">other products during the event</a>, dubbed \"Wonderlust.\" Here's how you can watch it and when, wherever you are in the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThere are multiple ways to watch the September 12 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Events Website</h2>\r<br />\nWith the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, iPhone, ‌iPad‌, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-events-webpage-sept-2023.jpg\" alt width=\"1215\" height=\"919\" />\r<br />\nJust navigate to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>YouTube</h2>\r<br />\nApple also plans to stream the event <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiP1l7jlIIA\">live on YouTube</a>, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiP1l7jlIIA\">YouTube live stream</a> can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?\">posted a placeholder for the September 12 event</a> on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple TV App</h2>\r<br />\nApple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the Apple TV, but ahead of WWDC 2020, it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/\">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent ‌Apple TV‌ app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the ‌Apple TV‌ app is available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/appleevents1.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1112\" />\r<br />\nThis includes the ‌Apple TV‌, iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as select smart TVs, streaming devices, and gaming consoles. If you have an ‌Apple TV‌, the ‌Apple TV‌ app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the ‌Apple TV‌ app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/iphone-15-apple-event-four-other-announcements/\">Apple's 'Wonderlust' Event: New Products to Expect Beyond the iPhone 15</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n<h2>When to Watch the Apple Event</h2>\r<br />\nApple's event will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, like most Apple events.
