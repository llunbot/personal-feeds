Other writing systems are often not part of the discussion — with the effect that a lot of brilliant websites stay unnoticed for a lot of us. Time to change that. If you’re up for a journey through Japanese web design, <a href=\"https://responsive-jp.com/\">Responsive Web Design JP</a> is for you. The examples in the collection shine with a <strong>unique lightness</strong> and concentration on the essential, and, even if you don’t master Japanese, you can browse the showcase by technique.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/web-design-inspiration-roundup/japan-rwd-opt.png\" /></p>\nDesign Made In Germany\n<p><a href=\"https://www.designmadeingermany.de/galerie/webseiten/\">Design Made In Germany</a> compiles the best design work from German agencies and designers. Apart from covering website design, there are also collections featuring stellar pieces of <strong>brand design</strong>, print design, packaging, logos, posters, movies, typefaces, and illustrations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/web-design-inspiration-roundup/made-in-germany-opt.png\" /></p>\nDark Mode Design\n<p><a href=\"https://www.darkmodedesign.com/\">Dark Mode Design</a> showcases beautifully designed websites that are either exclusively in dark mode or have the ability to switch. Wonderful examples that dark mode is not an add-on to a “regular” light design but a style with lots of <strong>creative possibilities</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/web-design-inspiration-roundup/darkmode-design-opt.png\" /></p>\nMinimal Design\n<p>Dominic Whittle and Tom Fitzgerald, curators of <a href=\"https://httpster.net/\">Httpster</a>, love good typography and <strong>effective, unpretentious design</strong>. More than ten years ago, they started emailing links of nice sites to each other but quickly realized that they needed a better system for sharing and tagging the things they get inspired by. That’s when Httpster was born.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/web-design-inspiration-roundup/httpster-opt.png\" /></p>\nLow-Carbon Websites\n<p>With big JavaScript libraries, large unoptimized images, and auto-playing videos, many incredible websites are heavier than they could be, creating a large, hidden carbon footprint. And then there are websites that prove that good design can also be achieved while keeping the carbon impact on the planet low. <a href=\"https://lowwwcarbon.com/\">Lowwwcarbon</a> features examples of <strong>sustainably built, low-impact websites</strong>. And if that’s not enough inspiration yet, <a href=\"https://lowww.directory/\">Lowww</a> is also dedicated to sustainable web design.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/web-design-inspiration-roundup/lowwwcarbon-opt.png\" /></p>\nOne Page Love\n<p><a href=\"https://onepagelove.com/\">One Page Love</a> showcases websites that get by with just one single page.
