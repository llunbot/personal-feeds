These kinds of cards are rarely exciting, but Steam Hardware Survey data shows that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/geforce-rtx-4060-review-not-thrilling-but-a-super-efficient-299-workhorse/\">these xx60</a> and xx50 cards are what the overwhelming majority of PC gamers are putting in their systems.</p>\n<p>The specs, <a href=\"https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1898951554322883046\">posted</a> by a reliable leaker named Kopite and reported <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5050-rtx-5060-and-rtx-5060-ti-specs-leak-expect-8gb-16gb-flavors-and-higher-tgps\">by Tom's Hardware and others</a>, suggest a refresh that's in line with what Nvidia has done with most of the 50-series so far. Along with a move to the next-generation Blackwell architecture, the 5060 GPUs each come with a small increase to the number of CUDA cores, a jump from GDDR6 to GDDR7, and an increase in power consumption, but no changes to the amount of memory or the width of the memory bus. The 8GB versions, in particular, will probably continue to be marketed primarily as 1080p cards.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/leaked-geforce-rtx-5060-and-5050-specs-suggest-nvidia-will-keep-playing-it-safe/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/leaked-geforce-rtx-5060-and-5050-specs-suggest-nvidia-will-keep-playing-it-safe/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa4cde35ae37d55560cc4500e654709c901852d6df4751e073ad7c883cc5936a","category":"Tech"}
