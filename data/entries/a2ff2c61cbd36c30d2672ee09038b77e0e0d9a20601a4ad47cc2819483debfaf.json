But this creation really moves the dial. The Lancashire-based bike brand remixed the high-end superbike at its in-house custom design and paint studio, decking out the Ultra SL R with some seriously hot components and embellishing the build with details personal to Spoony.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the paint. The Ultra SL R’s T1000/800 carbon frameset has been hand-coated in a black and gold marble paint scheme, featuring a Spoony logo in gold leaf on one of the fork legs and handwritten lyrics from the Prince track ‘Starfish and Coffee’ on the chainstays. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DJ says, ‘Prince wrote the song about an autistic girl he went to school with. It teaches us people with special abilities, or who are different, are extraordinary – we are the ordinary ones.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The one-piece Ribble Ultra Aero Carbon integrated handlebar is colour-matched to the frame, while the Mavic Cosmic SL 45 Carbon Tubeless Disc wheels feature custom Silk Graphics decals. A gold Kustom Kapz top cap with DJ Spoony logo completes the cockpit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect for a machine that’s had this much time and effort applied to its creation, no expense has been spared on the componentry. The Ultra SL R has a 12-speed Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200 groupset, while the drivetrain is spiced up with a KMC X12 TiN gold chain. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/ribble-dj-spoony-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Practical additions include tubeless Continental GP5000 28mm tyres and a black Fizik Arione R5 Kium saddle perched on a Ribble Ultra SL R carbon seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DJ Spoony doesn’t intend to hang the custom creation on his studio wall simply to be admired, either.
