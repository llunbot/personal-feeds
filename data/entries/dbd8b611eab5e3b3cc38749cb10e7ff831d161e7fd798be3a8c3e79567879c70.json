The story of one talented BMXer’s cliché-ridden rise from paperboy to pro, RAD was famously in limbo for decades as a battle for the rights kept it off the shelves. But that’s been settled, and there’s finally a 4K remaster back in circulation. And on Thursday, March 21st, marking 38 years to the day since its original release, that 4K version is being shown in theaters across the country. <a href=\"https://www.fathomevents.com/events/rad-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">The re-release is being run by Fathom Events,</a> where you can find a screen near you that’ll take you back to Helltrack. Just don’t over-rotate.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rad-movie-screenings-2024/\">Fathom Events Presents: RAD – 2024 Movie Screenings</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"dbd8b611eab5e3b3cc38749cb10e7ff831d161e7fd798be3a8c3e79567879c70","category":"Cycling"}
