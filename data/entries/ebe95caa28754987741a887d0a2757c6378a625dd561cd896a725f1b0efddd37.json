For MTB, cross-country, gravel and cyclocross riders, the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45k9L2s\" target=\"_blank\">Assioma PRO MX pedals</a> are built to withstand whatever the trail throws at them, all while offering class-leading data collection and accuracy with every pedal stroke.

Unlike most power meter pedals, all of the most sensitive electronic components that are essential to the system’s operation are situated not in the pedal body but instead in the Assioma PRO MX’s hermetically sealed stainless-steel pedal spindle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes the rechargeable batteries, strain gauges and all the key electronic parts, leaving only the mechanical pedal itself on the outside. This removes any threat of vibration, water, dust or mud affecting the system’s operation, and also means you can easily change the pedal body on its own should you wish to refresh the look of your pedals.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-3-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-3-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-3-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-3-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The result is a reliable and dependable product that ensures stable power supply with no dropouts through the entirety of every session, no matter how rugged the terrain or extreme the riding conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, given the terrain that the Assioma PRO MX power meter pedals are designed for, they need to be able to withstand a fair amount of physical abuse from rock strikes and wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting the key electrical components inside the pedal spindle goes a long way to achieving that, but the rest of the Assioma PRO MX pedal is equally well designed using premium materials for robust, rock-solid reliability.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"961\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-961x970.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-961x970.jpg 961w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-297x300.jpg 297w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-768x775.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-750x757.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4-1140x1150.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The 6061-T6 aluminium-bodied pedals rotate using a combination of needle-roller bearings and axial washers, which offer improved impact resistance and ease of maintenance. The ChroMoly SPD-compatible clipless system, meanwhile, has undergone surface treatments to achieve a surface hardness of up to 800HV, to ensure maximum resistance to wear and oxidisation over the life of the pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its rugged construction and advanced electronics, a weight of just 191.4g per pedal makes the Assioma PRO MX the lightest pedal-based power meter system available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Better batteries</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As already mentioned, the Assioma PRO MX uses rechargeable batteries rather than the more common disposable cells. Aside from being more environmentally friendly, it allows the batteries to be fully sealed inside the hermetic spindle and directly welded to the electronic circuit rather than needing to remain accessible inside a battery compartment that can open and close. And because they are directly welded, there’s no risk of power dropouts due to faulty contacts either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the batteries themselves, each lithium-ion battery is individually tested before being integrated into the sensor, and Favero says they are good for upwards of 60 operating hours from a single charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to recharging them, the USB charging system allows you to plug them into everything from wall chargers to portable power banks without uninstalling them from the crank arms, and even after 500 complete recharges – the equivalent of more than 25,000 hours of use – overall capacity is reduced by only 20%.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-5-970x766.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-5-970x766.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-5-300x237.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-5-768x607.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-5-750x593.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-5-1140x901.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/favero-assioma-PRO-MX-5.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Assioma PRO MX: the smarter power meter pedal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweight, efficient, long-lasting… the list of the Assioma PRO MX’s strengths goes on and on.
