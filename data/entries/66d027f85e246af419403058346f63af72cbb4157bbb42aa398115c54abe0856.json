It has now expanded to additional countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ was introduced in October 2023, shipping out to customers in November. It is similar in design to the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2, but it has a sliding cap with a USB-C port for charging because it is unable to charge magnetically.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo keep the price low, Apple did not include features like Double Tap and pressure sensitivity in the USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌, but it does support tilt functionality and ‌Apple Pencil‌ hover. As for compatibility, it works with USB-C iPads that run iOS 17.1 or later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that refurbished products like the USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ undergo fully functionality testing, as well as cleaning and repackaging. Refurbished ‌Apple Pencil‌ USB-C models include the same one-year limited warranty as new models.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-us/\">Refurbished USB-C Apple Pencil Now Available in U.S. and Canada</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-now-available-in-u-s-and-canada.2431162/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"66d027f85e246af419403058346f63af72cbb4157bbb42aa398115c54abe0856","category":"Apple"}
