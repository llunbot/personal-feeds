You still have one final chance to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $2,500 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>\n<p>So far, over 275 readers have contributed more than $26,000 to either the <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/donate/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href=\"http://www.childsplaycharity.org/\">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (EFF is now leading in the donation totals by nearly $7,000). That's a long way from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/\">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still a bit of time until the Charity Drive wraps up at the end of the day today, (Tuesday, January 2, 2024).</p>\n<p>Don't put off your donation any longer! Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993182#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993182&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a3dcfa651e127c882619785c8bc941d43b5cdcc79d6630797c10d629a0113ac","category":"Tech"}
