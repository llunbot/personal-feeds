She is standing astride her bike, waiting for the start of the fourth stage of the 2006 Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale, the women’s equivalent of the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As she waits in front of the crowd, she finds an inner calm; all noise fades away as her thoughts turn back in time. She sees her 12-year-old self – the girl who had sat at home in the Vale of Glamorgan every summer and watched Tour de France highlights on TV; the girl who was inspired by seeing Robert Millar climbing in the Alps and Pyrenees; the girl who dreamed that one day she would do the same.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mont-ventoux-s-wild-side-france-big-ride\">Mont Ventoux’s wild side: France Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Tour de France Femmes 2023: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mont-ventoux-the-giant-of-provence\">Mont Ventoux: Tour de France Classic Climb</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Ahead is a 115km ride to l’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. It is a special stage with one of cycling’s most revered climbs – Mont Ventoux – on the route. Cooke is wearing yellow. She has been in the leader’s jersey since her Stage 1 time-trial victory in the Pyrenean ski resort of Font Romeu, and is now nearly one minute ahead of the second placed rider. Her Univega teammates have also been enjoying success, picking up two more stage wins as the peloton crossed the southern reaches of France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one stage remains after today and Cooke is in pole position. There is no need for her to do anything drastic – she has never ridden Ventoux before. It is up to the others to try to take the jersey from her shoulders. Cooke can just monitor everybody else, save her energy, react if need be. That’s all she needs to do. But this is Ventoux and that 12-year-old is there, watching her every pedal stroke.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power and glory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The flag drops and Cooke’s team quickly goes to work. Ventoux is being climbed via its north side, from Malaucène, and starts some 35km into the stage. From here it is 21km at an average of 7.5%, with stretches up to 12%. Cooke wants a high pace leading into the foot of climb, and the team obliges. As they exit Malaucène she is perfectly placed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 2km in, just as Mont Ventoux begins to bite for the first time, Cooke accelerates hard. Soon she has a gap that no one can bridge and she powers on alone in the heat of a Provençal afternoon, knowing the famous sun-bleached, wind-blasted summit is inching closer. At the top her lead is around three minutes; then she launches herself onto the descent into Bédoin. At the bottom her lead is four minutes, a gap she maintains all the way to the finish.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Behind, the peloton is in pieces. Just one rider – Maryline Salvetat – gets within five minutes of Cooke. Four riders then trail in more than 11 minutes back and the stage’s top ten is finally completed when France’s Sylvie Gaillon crosses the line just shy of 19 minutes after Cooke raised her arms into the air. It is carnage. The Briton’s overall lead is now more than six minutes, and tomorrow she will be crowned winner of the entire race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A dream day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In his 2017 book <em>Ventoux – Sacrifice And Suffering On The Giant of Provence</em>, Jeremy Whittle describes Cooke’s performance as a ‘virtuoso display of attacking riding that ranked with the Ventoux’s greatest exploits’. Cooke tells Whittle that the prestige of the day was the reason for her aggression; that she wanted to ‘really stamp my authority on the race’, and ‘put myself to the test. I felt I could ride it really well, and I wanted to see if I could do it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooke also places her move in some context, admitting that the quality of the field wasn’t as strong as at some other races and saying that she wouldn’t have tried such a move at a race like the Giro. It is also undeniable that by 2006 the Grande Boucle, which had started in 1992 from the ashes of previous versions of a women’s Tour de France, had faded in scale and was now only five stages long. Nevertheless, it is rare for a rider to dominate in such a fashion on any stage of any race, let alone on the slopes of one of cycling’s most intimidating mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooke’s exploits received little press attention in Britain, with Whittle admitting that instead, ‘We – the British cycling media – were chasing Jan Ullrich, Ivan Basso and the others around a hotel car park in Strasbourg as Operación Puerto overshadowed the Grand Départ of the 2006 [men’s] Tour. Nicole’s triumph over the Ventoux went unrecognised because of the obsession with doping and because of gender bias.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that indifference was sadly indicative of the time, Cooke’s 2006 stage win over Ventoux remains one of the highlights of a hugely successful career that included World Championship and Olympic titles, a Giro win, two Grande Boucle triumphs, three Flèche Wallonne victories, a Tour of Flanders and multiple National Championships and World Cup victories. In 2016 she told this writer that experiences like soloing over Ventoux were ‘something a little special. I think it goes with rising to the occasion. This is a big day, this is when you are really going to go for it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the end of the stage, as Cooke headed to the finish line knowing the win was in the bag, her mind drifted back to her 12-year-old self. ‘This time she was leaping about, trying to show me something,’ Cooke writes in her 2014 autobiography <em>The Breakaway</em>. ‘She had a picture frame in her hand with a photograph in it. It was of a rider in a yellow jersey, on a bike… the mountain background of the picture was a moonscape… We both smiled. The little girl gave me the picture I treasure so much.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/nicole-cooke-cyclist\">Pro race history: Nicole Cooke tames Mont Ventoux</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b09d9131b493372fbcb396782725944b14d925b8d1a8dd974219a056d3298ef1","category":"Cycling"}
