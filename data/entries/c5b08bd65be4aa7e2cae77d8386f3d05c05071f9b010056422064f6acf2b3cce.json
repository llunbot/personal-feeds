{"title":"Turns Out, Since 2023, You Can Use WhatsApp Across Multiple Phones","link":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/one-whatsapp-account-now-across-multiple-phones","date":1749320489000,"content":"\n<p>WhatsApp, on their official blog back in April 2023:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last year, we introduced the ability for users globally to\n<a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/\">message seamlessly across all their devices</a>, while\nmaintaining the same level of privacy and security.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we’re improving our multi-device offering further by\n<em>introducing the ability to use the same WhatsApp account on\nmultiple phones</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A feature highly requested by users, now you can link your phone\nas one of up to four additional devices, the same as when you link\nwith WhatsApp on <a href=\"https://web.whatsapp.com/\">web browsers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/download\">tablets and desktops</a>.\nEach linked phone connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring\nthat your personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end\nencrypted, and if your primary device is inactive for a long\nperiod, we automatically log you out of all companion devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I wrote about WhatsApp <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/02/whatsapp-for-ipad\">finally shipping for iPad earlier this week</a>, I mentioned that you couldn’t use a secondary phone as a linked device to your primary phone. That used to be true, but obviously, I missed that this changed two years ago. Glad to know it. I’ve already added my Android burner and my spare iPhone that I use for summer iOS betas. <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/1317564962315842/?cms_platform=android\">WhatsApp has a support document on linking devices</a> that explains the somewhat hidden way you do this with a secondary phone. My thanks to several readers who pointed me to this.</p>\n\n<p>This makes it seem all the more spiteful, though, that Meta didn’t allow the iPhone version of WhatsApp to run on iPads (like they do with the still-iPhone-only Instagram app). I heard from a little birdie this week — second- or maybe even third-hand, so take it with a grain of salt — that Meta had this WhatsApp for iPad version ready to go for a while, and has been more or less sitting on an iPad version of Instagram, as negotiating chits with Apple. Negotiating for what, I don’t know. But if that’s true, perhaps some (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/04/meta-and-yandexs-local-mess-exploit-seemingly-only-works-on-android\">but definitely not all</a>) of the ice has thawed between the two companies. I don’t see it happening, but it sure would get a big audience response if Instagram for iPad gets some sort of announcement during the WWDC keynote, perhaps as part of “<em>iPadOS is now a fuller, more complete, computing experience than ever</em>” segment.</p>\n\n<p>One other oddity I encountered, when adding my Android phone as a linked device: by design, <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/5550163238402916\">there is no way to sign out of WhatsApp on your primary iOS or Android device</a>. If you are signed in to WhatsApp using another phone number, the only way to sign out on that device and then set it up as a linked device to your primary WhatsApp account is to delete WhatsApp from your phone and reinstall it. Weird.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/07/whatsapp-phone-as-linked-device\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c5b08bd65be4aa7e2cae77d8386f3d05c05071f9b010056422064f6acf2b3cce","category":"Tech"}
