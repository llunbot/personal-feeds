{"title":"The Information: ‘Meta Asked Amazon, Microsoft to Help Fund Llama’","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-asked-amazon-microsoft-help-fund-llama","date":1745274543000,"content":"\n<p>Kalley Huang and Erin Woo, reporting for The Information (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3ln2ngxzqn22l\">via Ed Zitron</a>, who summarized it on Bluesky):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meta Platforms over the past year asked Microsoft, Amazon and\nothers to help pay the costs of training Meta’s flagship large\nlanguage model, Llama, according to four people briefed on the\ndiscussions. Meta’s overtures reflected worries about the growing\ncosts of its artificial intelligence development, according to two\nof the people. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Meta in particular has faced questions about the business logic\nbehind its AI development, given that Llama is open-source\nsoftware, freely available for anyone’s use. That makes it\ndifficult to turn into a business. And Meta makes money primarily\nfrom advertising and has little experience in selling business\nsoftware.</p>\n\n<p>While Meta held its most serious discussions with Amazon and\nMicrosoft, it has also discussed the idea with Databricks, IBM and\nOracle, as well as representatives from at least one Middle\nEastern investor, according to two of the people briefed on the\ndiscussions. Meta was still in discussions with companies about\nthe Llama Consortium as recently as the start of this year, the\ntwo people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“<em>Would you consider throwing a few sacks full of</em> your <em>cash on this bonfire of</em> our <em>cash that we’ve been burning?</em>” is a hell of a pitch.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In its discussions with other companies, Meta primarily asked for\nmoney. It also sought servers or other resources that would offset\nthe cost of training its models, according to two of the people\nbriefed on the discussions. In return for their assistance, Meta\ndiscussed offering other companies promotion of their services\nalongside Llama — for example, a Meta executive might appear at a\nconference hosted by a consortium partner — or providing more\ninsight into the training process for the model, one of those\npeople said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pay a little and a Meta representative will show up at your developer conference. Pay more and Meta <em>won’t</em> show up at your developer conference.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/21/the-information-meta-llama\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0923577ab764e94b0e3e52f32a1550744589527542637c93f4b4b25b1c89be62","category":"Tech"}
