The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/team-sky\">Ineos Grenadier</a> eventually lost a minute to his GC rivals.</p>\n<p>But we know the narrative. Since parting ways in 2019, Carapaz and Movistar have not had an amicable split. So it came as no surprise that with Carapaz trailing behind, some wanted to put the nail into the coffin.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9968/who-are-the-favourites-for-the-2021-vuelta-a-espana\">Who are the favourites for the 2021 Vuelta a Espana?</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nFirst, an attack by old man Alejandro Valverde, a softener. Then from Miguel Angel Lopez. And in the final kilometre, Enric Mas, the team's likely leader surged clear of the pack. Granted, he only took 3 seconds from red jersey wearer Primoz Roglic at the line, in large part to being chased down by his own teammate Lopez, but it's the thought that counts.</p>\n<p>It was good to see the Movistar trident – the greatest comedy trio since The Goodies – continuing the storyline of their cursed Netflix series <em>The Least Expected Day. </em>Series 3 guarantees to be a corker.</p>\n<p>As for the rest, it was as it was before the day begun, the biggest ride of note coming from Fabio Aru, enjoying his final hoorah with an impressive 13th on the day.</p>\n<p>As for the stage, it was fairytale stuff for Estonian Rein Taaramae – pronounced <em>Ryan Terry May</em> according to Sean Kelly – who celebrated ten years since his last Vuelta victory with nott only the stage but also the race lead. He maanaged to outwit and outmuscle Joe Dombrowski and King Kenny Ellissonde to the win.</p>\n<p>Proof that the Rein in Spain wins mainly on the P(lain)icon Blanco. </p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9988/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-3-gallery#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 21</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage3-2.jpg?itok=mNfwJkn3\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>21</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9988/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-3-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 3 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>17 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9988%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%203%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9988%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%203%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9988%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%203%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9988%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9988/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-3-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 21</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage3-1.jpg?itok=iU3fabb_\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a40ca0ef7996fb1e3cf274cc0dc42a99e20f173c019c691cdd8dd60de8a7734e","category":"Cycling"}
