It turns out that a plus hardtail with relaxed geometry is a nearly perfect bike to ride around the neighborhood with your kids as they learn to ride. The only catch? I didn’t find the standard 9º backsweep all that comfortable while sitting upright and noodling around town. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have a lot of experience with high-sweep bars as Ron is our resident <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=alt+bar\">Alt-bar</a> expert, but I knew that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hudski-dualist-do-it-all-bike/\">Hudski</a> has a few options. I liked the idea of trying the same bar with three different sweeps to figure out what I liked best. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hudski Longhorn handlebar details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hudski Longhorn bars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-7-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Printed specs under the grip will remind you of the bar’s measurements in the future.

Equipped as the standard bar on their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/city-bike-gravel-bike-mtb-the-hudski-doggler-combines-modern-standards-unique-style/\">Doggler ATB</a>, the Longhorn 16 is right in the middle with a 16º backsweep. They also offer a Longhorn 10 and Longhorn 27 with 10º and 27º backsweeps respectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hudski Longhorn handlebar front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Hudski Longhorn handlebar from top sweep\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-8-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All three bars have the same 790mm width, 50mm rise, 4º upsweep, and 31.8mm clamp surface. That makes it so the backsweep is the only difference between the three – perfect for a backsweep shootout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right away I knew I would like the Longhorn 16 as that was the bar I rode on the Doggler. But how would the 10 and 27 fare? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the 16º ended up being the Goldilocks setup. I found that the 10º wasn’t a big enough change from the 9º bar I was already riding, and the 27º bar felt like <em>too</em> much backsweep for my liking. The 16º bar is more comfortable for casual cruising, but it still feels confident if you want to ride more aggressively. I’m not about to switch all my bikes over to higher sweep, but for bikes like the Hayduke, it works. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hudski Longhorn handlebar details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hudski Longhorn handlebar stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The Longhorn has beautifully minimal branding, just a debossed Hudski logo, and Longhorn script with specs. There’s also a small alignment guide on the back. I wish the RaceFace stem was as subtle. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to note though – I found that I needed to increase my stem length by at least 10mm to keep my preferred positioning on the bike. I was after a bar that put my wrists in a more natural position, not a shorter reach. Some riders will welcome the more upright positioning that comes with bringing the grips back closer to your body though, so I’d recommend doing some experimentation with the bar and stem. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hudski Longhorn handlebar \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hudski-Longhorn-handlebar-big-sweep-high-rise-comfort-MTB-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I’m very happy with the new hand position on the bike, and at $79.00 per bar, it’s a relatively inexpensive way to make a big change to your comfort. If you’ve ever been curious about high-sweep bars, the Hudski Longhorn seems like a good place to start. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://hudskibikes.com/collections/bars/products/equipment-longhorn-handlebar-16º?variant=39748987519039\" target=\"_blank\">hudskibikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/looking-for-a-more-comfortable-handlebar-position-hudski-longhorn-sweeps-provide-options/\">Looking for a More Comfortable Handlebar Position?
