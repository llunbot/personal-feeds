Fossilized feces and vomit from dinosaurs might hold important clues to how and why this evolutionary milestone came about, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature.</p>\n<p>Co-author Martin Qvarnström, an evolutionary biologist with Uppsala University in Sweden, and his collaborators studied trace fossils known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromalite\">bromalites</a>, a designation that includes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolite\">coprolites</a> as well as vomit or other fossilized matter from an organism's digestive tract. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-fossilized-fishs-skull-is-filled-with-feces/\">previously reported</a>, coprolites aren't quite the same as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleofeces\">paleofeces</a>, which retain a lot of organic components that can be reconstituted and analyzed for chemical properties. Coprolites are fossils, so most organic components have been replaced by mineral deposits like silicate and calcium carbonates.</p>\n<p>For archaeologists keen on learning more about the health and diet of past populations—as well as how certain parasites evolved in the evolutionary history of the microbiome—coprolites and paleofeces can be a veritable <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/gut-check-fossil-finds-give-us-a-history-of-life-and-what-it-ate/\">goldmine of information</a>.
