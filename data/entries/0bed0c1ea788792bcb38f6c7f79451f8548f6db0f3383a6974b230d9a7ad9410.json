Here’s an excerpt from a conversation between BTD &amp; Howes that took place on April 2nd, 2024, where they <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/alex-howes-interview?afid=707B851E-D827-4A2B-BC51-9C75F5ED6989&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=howes_interview\">went down the rabbit hole</a> on all things bicycle.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bertrand Mejia-Morin (from BTD): </strong>Alex, thanks for taking the time to chat… what driving forces were behind you leaving the WorldTour team that you were on (EF) and targeting a more freeform off-road-centric privateer life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alex Howes: </strong>The number one driver behind it all was just wanting to be home more with family. COVID was long, and the professional cycling world spent a lot of time just in the bubble. [It required] a lot of time away from home — literally months — so it just wasn’t a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>How do you tackle balancing being a professional racer with [having a family]?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>It’s funny because people use the word balance a lot… and the reality is it doesn’t feel balanced on any level or in either direction… the highs are super high and the lows are low — get things done when you can, and just forget about them when you can’t. Accept the chaos… [know it] doesn’t last forever, and if you just keep tapping away at the pedals and having fun with it… the snow melts and the form shows up and there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo/BikeTiresDirect)\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Gretchen Powers)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Break Into Bike Privateering</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>Any advice for people who are trying to similarly privateer their way through the US off-road racing scene?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>It is surprisingly competitive these days. People do their research, both in racing and in putting together sponsorship proposals and decks and everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First bit of advice: don’t think it won’t be a job. If you want to do it, it’s a lot of work. If you want to make it happen you gotta pick up the phone. You gotta get the keyboard out. You gotta hustle hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10-15 years ago, if you wanted to be a pro cyclist, you gotta go UCI, and that’s that. [Now], there’s no one right way to do anything in the privateer world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>What is the most underrated or overlooked thing that you carry with you during races?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>I always bring super glue with me… I’ve used it more often than I feel like I should have. I glued bar tape back together mid-race one time when I cut it and it was flapping. It was just driving me crazy. I’ve super glued cuts. I’ve glued tire plugs in. I mean, there are 58,000 uses for it and you can get the super tiny ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour Divide vs Tour de France</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>How would you compare some of the more structured [WorldTour] races to a race from your Privateer career like the Tour Divide… just you out there on your own?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>I mean it’s kind of funny because at the end of it all there were a lot of metrics that kind of lined up. If you look at fatigue scores… they were almost identical between the two of them — between the Tour Divide and the Tour de France. Which is comical because they’re not even in [the same] universe on so many other levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[For] the Tour Divide I mean, I would be surprised if I averaged 105 watts, overall. Versus the Tour de France — I don’t think there’s a day where you average under 220… which doesn’t sound like a lot but for someone that’s 63 kilos, [at] 220 [you’re] pushing for a lot. So anyways, it was surprising how well they compared on some levels, [but then are] totally different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>And if I recall correctly, You were on the Pirelli Cinturato Gravel Ms for the Tour Divide? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>They’re still going. Yeah, I rode them two days ago — the exact same tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes4.jpg\"><img width=\"1067\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes4.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo/BikeTiresDirect)\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes4.jpg 1067w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes4-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes4-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes4-1024x1536.jpg 1024w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Wil Matthews)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alex’s Favorite Road Tire</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>On that note, what’s your favorite tire you’ve ridden?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>Yeah, the bummer with tires is you remember a whole bunch that you really didn’t like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a good tire you forget about it, and you’re just enjoying your bike ride. If you don’t have a good tire you’re either fixing it or you’re terrified because it’s coming apart on you or you’re crashing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ones that I probably spent the most time on that I really enjoyed were the Vittoria Corsa [N.EXTs] … I rode those things in training a ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was gonna go buy a pair of tires to ride and race, those are the tires… between [the compound] and running them tubeless. I just think about how many tubes I used to use a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo/BikeTiresDirect)\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alexhowes3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Gretchen Powers)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cycling Industry — Thoughts and Feelings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>What’s your least favorite thing about the bike industry?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>I feel like we’re always chasing… there’s a cycle to it every year. And I feel like everybody is a month behind at all times? Me included — I’m two months behind and I’ve just accepted that. Like, I’m putting my bikes together now, which is kind of ridiculous… why don’t we all just hit pause for a month and let it all catch up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>How about your favorite thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>I think there’s a lot of just genuinely happy people that do stuff with bikes. And that’s why they get into the industry. For all its shortcomings… <em>everybody </em>wants to be there. They’re just trying to figure out how to stay there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>Did we touch on how we linked up? I called you guys up out of the blue. I said “hey, you wanna do something?” You guys are like, “we don’t do that but I guess we could. What do you want?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Tires, duh!” And I [explained] the whole rationale [behind] the [Lifetime] Grand Prix, with gravel racing, and with what I do; no single tire brand makes the perfect tire for every race. And tires are 50% of the game in off-road endurance racing. Maybe 50% is generous, but you’re not gonna win anything if you’re not getting to the finish line with air in your tires, so yeah…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted the ability to mix and match, and you guys said “Alright, yeah. We do shipping.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it’s been fun. I’ve tested a lot of stuff and found some stuff I like, and some I don’t. I found a pair of tires that will apparently last for 7,000 miles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BTD: </strong>And you were a real test subject for this year — 2024 now includes five athlete partnerships for BikeTiresDirect. And it’s been great to be able to share our base of knowledge and resources with other folks… be a part of their seasons and a part of their careers, even in a small way. So in that respect, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a great partnership so far and we’re really looking forward to what the next year and beyond has to hold working with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Howes: </strong>And I appreciate it. Yeah, and the reason I called you guys is because I just kept buying stuff from you guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[both laugh]</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks for reading.
