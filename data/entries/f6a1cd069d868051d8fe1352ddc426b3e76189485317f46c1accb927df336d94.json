The company wants to increase its global electric vehicle sales to 1 million units annually by 2026, further ramping up to 1.6 million by 2030. New products like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975385&amp;preview=true\">EV5 crossover</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-our-first-look-at-kias-ev9-three-row-electric-suv/\">EV9 SUV</a> will certainly help with this push, but smaller, more affordable EVs will be crucial to Kia's success, as well. That's why, despite being called concept cars, the new EV3 and EV4 are thinly veiled glimpses into Kia's next round of production EVs.</p>\n<p>Unveiled at Kia's EV Day event in South Korea this week, the EV3 and EV4 will arrive in the next few years. The company also spoke about an even smaller EV2 that will be designed for Europe and emerging markets, with the goal for that car being a super-low starting price—something around the equivalent of $30,000.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/4-Concept-EV3_EXT1-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"There's a strong family resemblance between the EV3, EV5, and EV9.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/4-Concept-EV3_EXT1-980x670.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/4-Concept-EV3_EXT1-scaled.jpg\">There's a strong family resemblance between the EV3, EV5, and EV9.</a> (credit: Kia)</p></div>\n<p>The EV3 and EV4 ride on the same E-GMP electric vehicle architecture that underpins the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/kias-new-ev6-electric-crossover-goes-straight-to-the-head-of-the-pack/\">Kia EV6</a> and EV9, as well as sister vehicles like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/the-2023-hyundai-ioniq-6-a-streamlined-look-equals-serious-range/\">Ioniq 6</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/the-2023-genesis-gv60-is-a-strong-contender-for-ev-of-the-year/\">Genesis GV60</a>. However, while the current crop of E-GMP vehicles are built with 800 V electrical architecture giving them fast charging speeds, the EV3 and EV4 will use a slightly more cost-effective version of this platform with a 400 V system. That's a bummer; one of the big highlights of cars like the Kia EV6 is its ability to charge at a max rate of 233 kW. With the EV3 and EV4, we could be looking at a maximum rate of 150 kW—or less.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975414#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975414&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6a1cd069d868051d8fe1352ddc426b3e76189485317f46c1accb927df336d94","category":"Tech"}
