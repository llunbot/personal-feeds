It was purpose-built in the cloud era to authenticate and access different clouds, systems, and endpoints, and centrally store, access, and deploy secrets (API keys, credentials, etc.). It also provides a simple workflow to encrypt data in flight and at rest. Over a dozen new partner integrations extend the Vault ecosystem to simplify secrets management across  infrastructure and applications.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/vault\">HCP Vault</a> is a fully managed platform operated by HashiCorp, allowing organizations to get HashiCorp Vault up and running quickly to secure applications and protect sensitive data.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1683731135-vault_blog_image_05012023.png\" alt=\"Vault\" /><h2><strong>New HCP Vault verified integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The following companies have verified new HCP Vault integrations:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Aerospike</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Aerospike is a multi-model, NoSQL real-time data platform for multi-cloud, large-scale JSON, and SQL use cases. With the <a href=\"https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/configure/security/vault\">HCP Vault integration</a>, users can store sensitive Aerospike server configuration parameters in HCP Vault. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>JumpWire</strong></h3>\n\n<p>JumpWire can transform your existing infrastructure by encrypting sensitive data in place. The <a href=\"https://docs.jumpwire.ai/vault-integration\">HCP Vault integration for electronic key management system (EKMS)</a> configures  JumpWire to use HashiCorp Vault for managing encryption keys. An additional <a href=\"https://docs.jumpwire.ai/vault-integration\">HCP Vault integration for database credentials</a> permits JumpWire to use dynamically generated credentials from Vault to authenticate to a database being proxied.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Rootly</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Rootly enables incident management directly from Slack. The new<a href=\"https://docs.rootly.com/integrations/hashicorp-vault\"> HCP Vault workflow integration</a> allows you to read secrets from your HCP Vault cluster and use your secrets in Rootly workflows securely. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>New Vault Enterprise integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>Cloudian</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Cloudian provides an S3 compatible object and file storage system. Vault’s <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/interoperability-matrix\">KMIP</a> secrets engine has been <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/interoperability-matrix\">validated</a> to provide encryption keys for Cloudian’s HyperStore software. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Dell</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dell PowerMax is a leading storage array that delivers end-to-end NVMe, storage class memory, and massive consolidation for mission-critical workloads. The new Dell <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/interoperability-matrix\">PowerMax KMIP integration</a> with Vault Enterprise allows companies to manage their encryption keys via Vault for their enterprise storage solutions.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>JumpWire</strong></h3>\n\n<p>JumpWire can transform your existing infrastructure by encrypting sensitive data in place. The <a href=\"https://docs.jumpwire.ai/vault-integration\">Vault Enterprise integration for electronic key management system (EKMS)</a> configures JumpWire to use HashiCorp Vault for managing encryption keys. An additional <a href=\"https://docs.jumpwire.ai/vault-integration\">Vault Enterprise integration for database credentials</a> permits JumpWire to use dynamically generated credentials from Vault to authenticate to a database being proxied. Both integrations support namespaces. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Marvell Technology</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Vault integrates with the Cavium HSM (hardware security module) via PKS#11 for customers who need hardware-backed security. The integration supports auto unseal, cryptographic key generation and management, and external entropy. Cavium also supports Vault's managed keys feature, which delegates handling, storing, and interacting with private key material to a trusted external key management service (KMS). These managed keys can be used in Vault’s PKI secrets engine to offload PKI operations to the Cavium</p>\n\n<h3><strong>NetApp</strong></h3>\n\n<p>NetApp simplifies the migration and running of business critical applications in the cloud. The new <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/interoperability-matrix\">Vault Enterprise KMIP integration</a> with NetApp StorageGRID eliminates the need for multiple key-management solutions by extending Vault key management to the NetApp StorageGRID object storage platform. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Nutanix</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Nutanix is a provider of cloud software and hyperconverged infrastructure solutions. The <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/interoperability-matrix\">Vault Enterprise EKMS integration</a> with Nutanix allows companies to manage their cryptographic keys with Vault for their Nutanix AHV hyperconverged infrastructure.    </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Rootly</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Rootly enables incident management directly from Slack. The new <a href=\"https://docs.rootly.com/integrations/hashicorp-vault\">Vault Enterprise workflow integration</a> supports namespaces, and allows you to read secrets from your Vault cluster and use your secrets in Rootly workflows securely. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>New Vault open source integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>AccuKnox</strong></h3>\n\n<p>AccuKnox simplifies the process of securing your workloads against software supply chain issues, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and malicious adversaries. The <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/partners/tech/accuknox-inc#vault\">AccuKnox Vault KubeArmor integration</a> utilizes KubeArmor to protect the Vault process and files in Kubernetes environments so malicious actors cannot access or modify the underlying data.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Buildkite</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Buildkite is a platform for running fast, secure, and scalable continuous integration pipelines on your own infrastructure. The new <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/partners/tech/buildkite#vault\">Buildkite integration with Vault </a>allows for the retrieval of secrets stored in Vault for use directly in pipeline steps. This allows all secrets to be stored and managed in Vault and retrieved as needed at runtime.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Gurucul</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Securely Gurucul, a platform for cyber security analytics, ingests, correlates, and normalizes all your data without the need for customization to reduce false positives. The Gurucul SIEM <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/partners/tech/gurucul-inc#all\">integration</a> with Vault delivers observability by ingesting Vault logs and then executing risk analysis and reporting.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Honeycomb</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Honeycomb is a software debugging tool that can help you solve problems faster within your distributed services.
