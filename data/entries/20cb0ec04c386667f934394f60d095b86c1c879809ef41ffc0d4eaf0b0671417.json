With an approachable $100/100€ price tag, the Shelter MIPS aims to “<em>set a new standard for more affordable MTB helmets, welcoming more riders to elevate their riding experience with confidence and style</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MET Shelter MIPS affordable mountain bike helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Shelter helmet looks a lot like any other modern half-shell mountain bike helmet. Including models that cost significantly more, like the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-rides-met-revo-mountain-bike-helmet-takes-both-cooling-safety-to-new-highs/\" target=\"_blank\">MET Revo MIPS</a> that we already tested earlier this season. It features an industry-standard in-mold polycarbonate shell with an EPS foam liner. The MIPS version of the Shelter comes with its namesake liner for enhanced rotational impact protection. Not surprisingly, the standard, non-MIPS version does not include the MIPS liner, and saves a bit of cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"The MET Shelter MIPS from the front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161GN1.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"The MET Shelter MIPS from the back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mips-mtb-helmet-M161RD1-back.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The Shelter has extended coverage, modern styling, and it comes in eight colors (<em>All photos/MET</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In keeping with modern trends, the Shelter has extended coverage for the back of the head, with the shell dropping down further to cover more of the occipital lobe. Like the vast majority of mountain bike helmets, it also has a break-away visor, which MET says is “<em>designed to integrate seamlessly into the helmet shell, refining the design without being longer than needed</em>.” It is not specified, but the visor does not appear to be adjustable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dialing in the fit is MET’s Safe-T Sport fit system, which features a 360-degree “<em>head belt</em>” to adjust the tension as needed. The Shelter comes in four shell sizes: S, M, L, and XL. This size range fits users with head circumferences between 52-64 cm. This gives riders with heads on the larger side of the spectrum another option to consider, as that 60-64cm XL is a bit of a rarity in performance MTB helmets at any price point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10.webp\" alt=\"Two female riders riding mountain bikes while wearing the MET Shelter MIPS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-10-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 12 vents with internal channels aim to move air through the helmet and provide ventilation. Additionally, the Shelter includes dedicated sunglasses ports intended to hold your shades securely while climbing or hanging out. MET also says this helmet is compatible with its Rear USB LED light for enhanced visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the spec sheet, the Shelter MIPS carries CE, AS/NZS, and U.S. safety certifications. The standard Shelter (non-MIPS) only lists CE and AS/NZS. The new Shelter also got <a href=\"https://www.helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html#75\" target=\"_blank\">a 5-star rating</a> in Virginia Tech’s Independent Impact Testing, ranking slightly higher than other 5-star helmets at low impact energy and slightly lower at the higher energy test. So, pretty average against all the other 5-star lids for the independent safety test comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MET Shelter – Pricing &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-20.webp\"><img width=\"1333\" height=\"1777\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-20.webp\" alt=\"Two mountain bikers looking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-20.webp 1333w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-20-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-20-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-20-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-20-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-19.webp\"><img width=\"1333\" height=\"1777\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-19.webp\" alt=\"Two mountain bikers wearing the MET Shelter MIPS helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-19.webp 1333w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-19-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-19-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-19-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/met-shelter-mtb-helmet-19-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Whether you’re riding your bike or gazing pensively skyward, the Shelter MIPS won’t break the bank</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new MET Shelter MIPS’s claimed weight is 360 grams in a size large, which is respectably light for an extended-coverage half-shell, and about 10% lighter than the more expensive Revo MIPS we recently reviewed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 80€ MET Shelter and $100 / 100€ Shelter MIPS helmets are available now. Although only the MIPS version will be sold in the U.S. market. MET offers the Shelters in a whopping 8 solid color options, all of which have low-key branding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t had the chance to get our hands on or heads in this helmet yet, but it looks like a solid new option to consider, especially for those operating on a budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.met-helmets.com/en/class/mtb-helmets/\">MET-helmets.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/met-shelter-mips-affordable-mountain-bike-helmet/\">New MET Shelter MIPS MTB Helmet is an Affordable Refuge For Your Head</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"20cb0ec04c386667f934394f60d095b86c1c879809ef41ffc0d4eaf0b0671417","category":"Cycling"}
