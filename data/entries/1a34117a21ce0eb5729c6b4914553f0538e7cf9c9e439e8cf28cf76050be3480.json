When the winners are announced at next year's New York International Auto Show, there will be a new category just for battery-electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>\"There has never been a better time to highlight and celebrate the world's best electric vehicles. We are thrilled to once again be part of this year's World Car Awards. With the importance of EVs and growing consumer interest, the need for trusted sources for consumers to turn to is paramount, and like the New York Auto Show, the industry's top journalists that make up the World Car Awards are a trusted resource for buyers as they research their next new vehicle,\" said Auto Show President Mark Schienberg.</p>\n<p>BEVs will be eligible to win the overall 2022 World Car of the Year award; the rules just require that a car be produced in volumes of at least 10,000 a year. The vehicle must also \"be priced below the luxury-car level in their primary markets\" and must be available in two major markets (China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Latin America, and the USA) in at least two continents, between January 1, 2021, and March 30, 2022.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788798#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788798&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
