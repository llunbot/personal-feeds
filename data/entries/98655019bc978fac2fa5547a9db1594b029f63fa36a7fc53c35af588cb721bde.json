These amounts are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/14/how-much-ram-iphone-12-pro-has/\">unchanged from the iPhone 12 lineup</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-13-colors.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe same Xcode strings accurately revealed the amount of RAM in iPhone 12 models last year and in several previous iPhone generations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niPhone 13 models feature a more power efficient A15 Bionic chip based on TSMC's advanced 5nm+ process, but Apple has not indicated how much faster the chip is compared to the A14 chip. The A15 chip also has a new 5-core GPU in iPhone 13 Pro models — up from 4 cores — that Apple says delivers the \"fastest graphics performance in any smartphone.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll four iPhone 13 models will be available to pre-order starting Friday, September 17 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time in the U.S. and over 30 other countries and regions.
