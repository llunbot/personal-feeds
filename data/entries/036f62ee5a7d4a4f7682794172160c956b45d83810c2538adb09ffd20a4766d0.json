However, the trial used a full dose of the Moderna vaccine (100 micrograms) for a booster, whereas the FDA has authorized a half-dose shot (50 micrograms) for boosters. It's unclear if the half dose offers the same edge over boosting with a third Pfizer-BioNTech shot, which is given at the same dosage as the first two shots (30 micrograms).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814284#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814284&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"036f62ee5a7d4a4f7682794172160c956b45d83810c2538adb09ffd20a4766d0","category":"Tech"}
