As far as what you’re getting, the Studio Display is essentially an iMac display with 5K resolution, a 12MP camera with Center Stage, six speakers, and a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports. And the Mac mini has a powerful M2 processor along with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Gigabit Ethernet, and a headphone jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a tiny footprint, the Mac mini can be hidden just like a real iMac. So if you don’t want to wait years for Apple to finally reboot the iMac Pro, build your own while the price can’t be beat.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"948ac6f74cd5b33771b667188043f19a7517f96969dca3ee7300467857f1dabe","category":"Apple"}
