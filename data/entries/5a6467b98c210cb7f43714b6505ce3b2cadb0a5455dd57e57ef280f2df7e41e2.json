The geographically dispersed collection of more than 16,000 compromised devices at its peak got its name because it exposes its malicious malware on port 7777.</p>\n<h2>Account compromise at scale</h2>\n<p>In July and again in August of this year, security researchers from <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/solving-the-7777-botnet-enigma-a-cybersecurity-quest/\">Sekoia.io</a> and <a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/botnet-7777-are-you-betting-on-a-compromised-router\">Team Cymru</a> reported the botnet was still operational. All three reports said that Botnet-7777 was being used to skillfully perform password spraying, a form of attack that sends large numbers of login attempts from many different IP addresses. Because each individual device limits the login attempts, the carefully coordinated account-takeover campaign is hard to detect by the targeted service.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/microsoft-warns-of-8000-strong-botnet-used-in-password-spraying-attacks/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/microsoft-warns-of-8000-strong-botnet-used-in-password-spraying-attacks/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a6467b98c210cb7f43714b6505ce3b2cadb0a5455dd57e57ef280f2df7e41e2","category":"Tech"}
