The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn January, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/\">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products, but it could be a decade before it emerges in the Mac owing to the complexity of the technology at this early stage. For comparison, Gurman noted that the ‌iPhone‌ will have had OLED displays for over six years by the time they are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/07/suppliers-preparing-for-oled-ipad-and-macbook/\">expected to come to the iPad</a>.

Apple reportedly kicked off the current form of its microLED project, codenamed T159, around 2017. At an earlier stage, it even wanted to introduce the technology <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/\">with the iPhone X</a>. The advanced display offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are \"painted\" atop the display glass, and replace parts currently supplied by companies like Samsung and LG.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/micro-led/\">Micro-LED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/10/microled-displays-for-iphone-vision-pro-apple-car/\">Custom MicroLED Displays Could Be Heading to the iPhone, Vision Pro, and Apple Car</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/custom-microled-displays-could-be-heading-to-the-iphone-vision-pro-and-apple-car.2398268/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"29835429a8b0cfe5085b5cc7178bf26de679a3f4db1250b6c5a25e6a20bf4469","category":"Apple"}
