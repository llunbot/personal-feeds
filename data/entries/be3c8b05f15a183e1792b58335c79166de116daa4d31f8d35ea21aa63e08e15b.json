The feature can be enabled for direct messages and in groups by members with administrator privileges.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest development of the feature lets users set all new messages to disappear by default, giving them the choice to move away from the accustomed world in which there's a permanent digital record of everything that's said. From the company's <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/more-control-and-privacy-with-default-disappearing-messages-and-multiple-durations\">blog post</a>: \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Today we are excited to provide our users with more options to control their messages and how long they stick around, with default disappearing messages and multiple durations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhatsApp users will now have the option to turn on disappearing messages by default for all new chats. When enabled, all new one-on-one chats you or another person start will be set to disappear at your chosen duration, and we've added a new option when creating a group chat that lets you turn it on for groups you create. This new feature is optional and does not change or delete any of your existing chats.</blockquote>In addition to the default option, WhatsApp is also adding two new durations for disappearing messages: 24 hours and 90 days, as well as the existing option of 7 days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo turn on disappearing messages by default for all new individual chats, go to <strong>WhatsApp Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Default message timer</strong>, and then select a duration.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen someone chooses to switch to default disappearing messages, WhatsApp will display a message in their chats that tells people this is the default they've chosen, to make it clear that it's nothing personal.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/07/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-default-option/\">WhatsApp Makes Disappearing Messages a Default Option With Multiple Durations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-makes-disappearing-messages-a-default-option-with-multiple-durations.2326525/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7qc-S2mhwcU:Gkyh-1KIh3o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7qc-S2mhwcU:Gkyh-1KIh3o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"be3c8b05f15a183e1792b58335c79166de116daa4d31f8d35ea21aa63e08e15b","category":"Apple"}
