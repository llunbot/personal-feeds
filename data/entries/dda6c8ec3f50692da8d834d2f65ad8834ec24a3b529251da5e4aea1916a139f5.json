His sentence, handed down on May 1, also includes an order to pay $100 million in restitution to Cisco, a $40,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. Aksoy will also have to pay his victims a sum that a court will determine at an unspecified future date, the DOJ said.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/onur_aksoy_-_indictment_redacted.pdf\">PDF</a>], Aksoy began plotting the scam around August 2013, and the operation ran until at least April 2022. Aksoy used at least 19 companies and about 15 Amazon storefronts, 10 eBay ones, and direct sales—known collectively as Pro Network Entities—to sell tens of thousands of computer networking devices. He imported the products from China and Hong Kong and used fake Cisco packaging, labels, and documents to sell them as new and real. Legitimate versions of the products would've sold for over $1 billion, per the indictment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021747#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021747&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dda6c8ec3f50692da8d834d2f65ad8834ec24a3b529251da5e4aea1916a139f5","category":"Tech"}
