And when they do, there’s a good chance they’ll be running <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262753/ios-17-5-beta-is-now-available-with-app-downloads-from-websites-in-eu.html\">iOS 17.5</a> with at least one new feature that has been on the iPhone for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/&amp;xcust=1-1-2287331-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors contributors Steve Moser and Aaron Perris</a>, the first iPadOS 17.5 beta contains numerous references to Battery Health, a feature that is currently limited to the iPhone. Among the strings unearthed in the code are references to battery capacity, cycles, and lifespan, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>“iPad must be regularly used while not connected to power to show maximum capacity.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“This is the number of times iPad has used your battery’s capacity.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“The iPad battery is performing as expected.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“iPad batteries, like all rechargeable batteries, have a limited lifespan and may eventually need to be serviced or replaced.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“The original battery was designed to retain X capacity at X cycles under ideal conditions. Actual battery performance depends on a number of variables, including how iPad is used and charged regularly. The one-year warranty includes service for defective batteries in addition to rights provided under local consumer laws.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all similar to messages in the Battery Health tab in the iPhone settings, which was added in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230921/ios-11-3-features-release-date-and-how-to-install-2.html\">iOS 11.3</a> in 2018. Of course, just because something is hidden in the code doesn’t actually mean it will ship, but it’s a good indication that Apple is nearing the release of the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect iPadOS 17.5 to launch in late April or early May—right around the time Apple is expected to ship the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a>.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"58c469a1d6d4e4eac70a60d0dfe0d91d8ff7d77ed826f878ea38167e298f4543","category":"Apple"}
