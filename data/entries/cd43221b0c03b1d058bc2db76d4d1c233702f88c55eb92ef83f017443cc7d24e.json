Bright flashing lights can trigger seizures and migraines, or just create general discomfort.

You can get the new update in the System tab in the Settings app. The update is for all Apple TV 4K models and Apple TV HD.</p>\n\nApple TV</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cd43221b0c03b1d058bc2db76d4d1c233702f88c55eb92ef83f017443cc7d24e","category":"Apple"}
