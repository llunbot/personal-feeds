This makes the volume extra-special, since only two other books once owned by Milton also contain handwritten notes. The scholars detailed their findings in <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/john-milton-annotated-holinshed-chronicles-commentary/\">a new article</a> published in the Times Literary Supplement.</p>\n<p>Holinshed's <em>Chronicles</em> is a hugely influential and comprehensive three-volume history of Great Britain, first published in 1577; it was followed by a second edition in 1587. A London printer named Reginald Wolfe started the project and hired Raphael Holinshed and William Harrison to help him create a \"universal cosmography of the whole world.\" Wolfe died before the book could be completed, and the project was eventually scaled down to a history of England, Scotland, and Ireland, complete with maps and illustrations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024241#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024241&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"663b59ccd0ccd51bd28462823e23fc432cbdfcb3485c2ac684bb39591cbb1401","category":"Tech"}
