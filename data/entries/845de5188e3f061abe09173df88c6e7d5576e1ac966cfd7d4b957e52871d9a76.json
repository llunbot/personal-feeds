With the design of the Ariane 6, they envisioned a modernized version of the previous rocket, optimized for cost. Because Ariane 6 would use a modified Vulcan engine and other components from previous Ariane rockets, it was anticipated that the new rocket would debut in 2020.</p>\n<p>European space policy, however, is every bit as political as that of the United States, if not more so. Member nations of Europe make financial allocations to the European Space Agency and expect roughly that amount of money in return in terms of space projects. So the development and production of Ariane 6 was spread across a number of nations under management of a large conglomerate, France-based ArianeGroup.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932585#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932585&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"845de5188e3f061abe09173df88c6e7d5576e1ac966cfd7d4b957e52871d9a76","category":"Tech"}
