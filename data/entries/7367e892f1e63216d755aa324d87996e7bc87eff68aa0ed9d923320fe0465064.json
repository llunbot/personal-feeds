{"title":"30 Years of Dave Winer’s Seminal Blog, Scripting News","link":"http://scripting.com/2024/10/07.html","date":1728336165000,"content":"\n<p>Dave Winer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today is the 30th anniversary of this blog. <em>Hola!</em></p>\n\n<p>I did a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/08/06/155950.html\">roundup of thoughts</a> when this blog turned 25. I\nstand by what I wrote then, but I’d add this. My blog started\nbecause I needed content to test a script I had written that sent\nemails on my Mac using <a href=\"http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html\">Eudora</a>, which was an early\n<a href=\"http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html\">scriptable app</a> and I had a nice scripting system that\nworked with it. I looked around for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/07/marccantersingsagain.html\">something</a> to send (30\nyears ago today), and shot out an email to the people whose\nbusiness cards I had collected at various tech conferences. It\nwas a thrill, so I did it <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/12/marcs10things.html\">again</a>, and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/13/lettertocannavino.html\">again</a> and\n<a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/14/howtoinvestinpdas.html\">three</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/16/randybattatonpdas.html\">more</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/17/pdasonparade.html\">times</a>, before I realized hey I\ncould use this thing to get <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html\">my own ideas</a> out\n<a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/\">there</a>. And thus began <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">this thing</a> that I still\ndo to this day. Look at the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html\">two</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/10/06/142657.html\">posts</a> I wrote\nabout WordPress in the last few days. There may be hope to find a\nblogosphere buried somewhere in there. And it may be possible to\ngive them some sweet new writing tools so they can get excited\nabout writing on the web the way we did all those years ago. I\nactually am kind of optimistic about that. Maybe we can stand up\nsomething in the midst of the noise. When we booted up\npodcasting, approx 20 years ago, we had a slogan — “Users and\ndevelopers party together.” It worked! That is still the way I\nwant to build stuff, it’s the only way I know how to do it.\nBlogging started out as a programming adventure and eventually\nbecame a form of literature. How about that. I’m up for doing\nmore of that if you all are. But please expect to make\ncontributions, don’t expect it all to come to you for free,\nbecause as we know nothing really is free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Winer is rightfully renowned for his technical achievements — outliners as an application genre, RSS in general, and RSS in the specific context of podcasting in particular — but what’s kept me reading Scripting News for the entirety of Scripting News’s 30-years-and-counting run is his writing. He has such a distinctive writing voice that is impossible to imagine in any medium other than the web. But I think that’s because he helped define what writing not just <em>on</em> the web, but <em>for</em> the web, even meant.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for it all, Dave.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/07/scripting-news-30-years\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7367e892f1e63216d755aa324d87996e7bc87eff68aa0ed9d923320fe0465064","category":"Tech"}
