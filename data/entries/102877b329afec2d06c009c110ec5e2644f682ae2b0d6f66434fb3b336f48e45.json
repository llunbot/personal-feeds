Apple has trademarked numerous names over the years, as shared by Parker Ortolani of The Verge:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>there are 15 names of places in California Apple trademarked but never used, to date every name they have used was one of those trademarks<br /><br />UNUSED:<br />Diablo<br />Condor<br />Tiburon<br />Farallon<br />Miramar<br />Rincon<br />Pacific<br />Redwood<br />Shasta<br />Grizzly<br />Skyline<br />Redtail<br />Sonoma<br />Sequoia<br />Mammoth<br /><br />USED:<br />Ventura…</p>— Parker Ortolani (@ParkerOrtolani) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1649509846138454022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1670742-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If macOS 14 is a so-called maintenance release–as is rumored–with few new features, it will likely be named after a location near Ventura. Based on the names above, Rincon and Skyline are the most likely names. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another potential name is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1795091/macos-14-name-skyline-rincon-ios-ipados-features.html\">Malibu</a>, suggested by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg and about 40m miles south of Ventura, but that name hasn’t been trademarked by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 release date: When will macOS 14 arrive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s usual venue for revealing the next major version of macOS is its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>. WWDC 2023 starts at 10am (PDT) on June 5, and during the keynote, Apple will reveal the name and new features of macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually releases a beta of the new macOS to developers at WWDC, and you have to be a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-1670742-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">registered developer</a> to access it. A public beta is released about a month later, and in order to get that, you must join <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">Apple’s Beta Program</a>. Read about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">How to install macOS beta</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what the beta release timeline could look like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>June 5:</strong> macOS 14 is revealed and the developer beta is released.</li><li><strong>July:</strong> Apple releases the first public beta.</li><li><strong>June to September/October:</strong> This is the beta period. Apple will release several beta updates during this time.</li><li><strong>September/October:</strong> macOS 14 is released to the general public.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The final version of macOS 14 will be released to the general public in the fall. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships. Here are the release dates for the previous five versions of macOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>macOS 13 Ventura:</strong> October 24, 2022</li><li><strong>macOS 12 Monterey:</strong> October 25, 2021</li><li><strong>macOS 11 Big Sur:</strong> November 12, 2020</li><li><strong>macOS 10.15 Catalina:</strong> October 7, 2019</li><li><strong>macOS 10.14 Mojave:</strong> September 24, 2018</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14 compatibility: Which Macs will be able to run macOS 14?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple released <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678251/macos-13-ventura-features-compatibility-download-install.html\">macOS Ventura</a>, the company cut numerous older Macs from the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/782634/macos-ventura-compatibility.html\">compatibility list</a>, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2015 iMac</li><li>2016 MacBook</li><li>2015-2017 MacBook Air</li><li>2015-2016 MacBook Pro</li><li>2014 Mac mini </li><li>2013 Mac Pro </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There haven’t been any rumors about Apple dropping support for any Macs this year <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1682885/ipados-ios-17-compatibility-devices-iphone-x-ipad-pro.html\">like we have with the iPad</a>, so it’s very possible that the compatibility list for macOS 14 is the same as Ventura. Here’s the possible compatibility list:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>MacBook models from 2017 or later</li><li>MacBook Air models from 2018 or later</li><li>MacBook Pro models from 2017 or later</li><li>Mac mini models from 2018 or later</li><li>iMac models from 2017 or later</li><li>iMac Pro (all models)</li><li>Mac Pro models from 2019 or later</li><li>Mac Studio (all models)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is always the possibility that a Mac may be compatible with macOS 14, but some of the new features won’t run on older Macs of the list. Some new features may also require Apple chips and not run on Intel-based Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14: How to install the beta and official version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple changed the beta process in macOS 13.4, so the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">way to install the macOS 14 beta</a> is different to what it was previously. Instead of downloading the Beta Access Utility for every device, you’ll only need to register your Apple ID for the beta program to install betas on every Apple device that is signed into that account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then when you go to Software Update, you’ll see a new tab for <em>Beta Updates</em>, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. If you want to install the beta, select <em>macOS 14 Public Beta</em>, and if you want to return to Ventura, select Off. To install the official version, you need to wait for Apple to start shipping it in the fall. Then, you’ll be able to use Software Update in System Settings, or you can download it from the App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: betas are not as stable as the official version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14: Rumored new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors about new features have been light—all we know so far is that macOS 14 is not expected to be a major release loaded with new features.   <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1795091/macos-14-name-skyline-rincon-ios-ipados-features.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported</a> in April 2023 that it likely won’t be “groundbreaking or significant” but rather will continue the trend of adding iOS features. As he writes: “The dream scenario is that you own an Apple Watch, an iPhone, a MacBook, an iPad, an Apple headset, and all five of those devices are capable of doing all the same things just in different use cases and at different times of the day.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also been reported that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1448952/ios-17-macos-14-fewer-major-changes.html\">shifted some macOS resources</a> to xrOS as Apple prepares to launch its new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">AR headset</a> at WWDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 14: New features we want to see</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if macOS 14 consists entirely of iOS features that make their way to the Mac, there are plenty we’d like to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dynamic Island for the Mac</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 14 Pro, Apple introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1069195/iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island-features-apps.html\">Dynamic Island</a>, which uses the pill-shaped cutout for Face ID and the selfie camera as an extraordinary UI element. It’s an ingenious feature that needs to at least <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1068105/dynamic-island-macbook-pro.html\">come to the MacBook Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynamic Island would alleviate the clutter on the right side of the macOS interface, which houses notifications, reminders, and widgets. But it could also be a great way to monitor the progress of something an app is working on in the background, act as an indicator for battery life, or display what Apple Music is playing, as on the iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, Apple’s 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the M2 MacBook Air already have display notches, so a trip to the Dynamic Island should be easy to book.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Time Machine iCloud mockup\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/time-machine-icloud-mockup.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>Apple could make a lot of money by offering cloud storage for Time Machine backups.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Time Machine iCloud backups</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This was on our wishlist for macOS 12 <em>and</em> macOS 13, and it’s going to stay on every wishlist until it happens. As I said before, I’ll say it again: Having an offsite backup is always a good idea, and Time Machine could be updated to do that along with the option for a local backup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Apple doesn’t seem to be interested in adding this feature to macOS out of necessity, allow me to take a different angle: It’s good for Apple’s bottom line. Think about it, Apple. You could make precious Services money from Time Machine iCloud backups by selling iCloud+ storage. Apple already has a $9.99/£6.99 tier that offers 2TB of storage— and I could see a new $6.99/£3.99 for 1TB of Time Machine iCloud+ storage tier. That’s about $84/£48 per year, and say, 500,000 users sign up for that. That’s a lot of money you’re making each year and a lot of happy Mac customers. How can you pass that up, Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Multi-item clipboard</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that we think could make a huge difference to the way we work is something that Windows users have enjoyed for years: the ability to copy and paste multiple items. Right now Mac users can copy and paste one thing at a time, but Windows users can have multiple items on their clipboard and can choose which one to paste. It’s such a simple thing and so useful, we really can’t understand why it’s not available on Macs unless you use a third-party tool, like <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100470607-11556984?sid=1-1-1670742-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.parallels.com/products/toolbox/\" target=\"_blank\">Parallels Toolbox</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fine-tune System Settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In my macOS 13 wishlist, I wanted Apple to rename System Preferences to Settings to match iOS and iPadOS. My wish came true, but at a price: Apple took it a step further and redesigned the UI to be more like the iPhone. That caused <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/836295/macos-ventura-system-settings-preferences-problems.html\">consternation</a> for the most hard-core Mac fans and confusion among even iPhone users–and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1144069/macos-ventura-system-settings-appearance-storage-extensions.html\">sent a lot of Mac users to Google</a> to find settings they thought were lost. There’s no going back now; System Settings and its UI are here to stay. But it could use some fine-tuning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d love to see Apple separate the interface from iOS. The look is fine, but some settings don’t make sense tucked away behind General or Desktop &amp; Dock. Top on the list: Time Machine (especially if Apple unlocks iCloud backups).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Apple iOS apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With macOS Ventura, Apple finally made Mac versions of the Clock and Weather apps that have been in iOS since forever. Why stop there? There are plenty of iOS apps that aren’t available on the Mac: Translate, Clips (which was on my macOS 13 wishlist), Health, Wallet (those two were on my macOS 12 wishlist), Support…maybe not Compass, Measure, and Magnifier. And hey, while they’re at it, revive <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232747/warren-buffets-paper-wizard-impressions.html\">Warren Buffet’s Paper Wizard</a> and bring it to the Mac!</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Dock Wallet mockup\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?resize=1536%2C865&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?resize=2048%2C1153&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wallet-app-macos-dock-mockup.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>More iOS apps, such as Wallet, should come to macOS.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>A version of macOS for iPad </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s always said it won’t happen, but there was a rumor (back in October 2022) that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1359226/macos-14-m2-ipad-pro-rumor.html\">macOS 14 could be destined for the M2 iPad Pro</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>According with my source Apple would be testing a smaller version of macOS exclusively for the new iPad Pro M2!<br />\"Mendocino\" should be the codename for macOS 14. A simplified version should be planned for the M2. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/f4RrainlZ1&amp;xcust=1-1-1670742-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/f4RrainlZ1</a></p>— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1583065617950613504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1670742-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">October 20, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumor came via Majin Bu Twitter, who said that Apple is working on a “smaller version of macOS” that will run “exclusively” on the M2 iPad Pro. Majin Bu doesm’t have a great track record though, and there is little evidence that Apple is working to merge the iPad and Mac lines, so it may never happen. But with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1814473/final-cut-logic-pro-ipad-subscription-launch.html\">Final Cut and Logic Pro now available on the iPad Pro</a> we should never say never. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bu claims that the “simplified” version of macOS 14 will have “a 25% larger macOS UI” that’s presumably optimized for touch. Apple’s already optimised Final Cut and Logic Pro for touch–if it did the same for macOS could we even see a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674551/touchscreen-mac.html\">touch-screen Mac</a>? Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has suggested such a Mac could be in Apple’s sights, despite Apple’s insistence that it won’t go down that path. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sync the Clock app across all devices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As I just said, with macOS Ventura, Apple finally brought over Mac versions of the Clock and Weather apps that have been in iOS and iPadOS. Yay! However, the Weather app syncs between devices, and the Clock app doesn’t. That means that alarms that you set on one device aren’t available on others. Boo!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy enough to set an alarm, but it would be way easier if those alarms synced across devices. While we’re at it, why not sync world clock entries? Or even timers–I create a lot of timers and would like to be able to control them from multiple devices. Oh, and since everyone might not want their iPhone timers on their Mac, then give us the option to turn syncing off.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macos ios clock\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2100w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macos-ios-clock.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>The Clock app arrived with macOS Ventura, but it doesn’t sync with the Clock app on iPhones and iPads.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stability and optimization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I can keep going with the wishes–a lot of what I wanted in my <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/342964/macos-12-features-appearance-apps-control-center-widgets-wishlist-release-beta.html\">macOS 12</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/632138/macos-13-features-wwdc-time-machine-control-center-password-manager.html\">macOS 13</a> wishlist have yet to become reality, and I’d still like to see them happen. But reports have said that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1448952/ios-17-macos-14-fewer-major-changes.html\">macOS 14 won’t have many major changes</a>, since the company is supposedly focusing on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">AR/VR headset</a> and its operating system, rumored to be called xrOS. Development for macOS 14, iOS 17, and iPadOS 17 is seemingly a lower priority until that device is unveiled.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unified version numbers </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, wouldn’t it be easier to read if they had the same version number? We’d love to see Apple jump from macOS 14 to a number more akin to iOS 17. Is it time for macOS 2024, iOS 2024 and iPadOS 2024? </p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"102877b329afec2d06c009c110ec5e2644f682ae2b0d6f66434fb3b336f48e45","category":"Apple"}
