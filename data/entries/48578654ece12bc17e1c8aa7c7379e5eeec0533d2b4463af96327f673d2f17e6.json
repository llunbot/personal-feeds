The feature, uncovered in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-4/\">iOS 18 beta 4</a> code by <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/23/apple-music-playlist-artwork-apple-intelligence/\"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, will enable users to generate unique images tailored to their playlists using Image Playground.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the core of this new functionality is a new \"Create Image\" button, which users will see while editing their playlists. Once tapped, this button will invoke Image Playground, a tool showcased at WWDC earlier this year. Image Playground enables users to generate new images by inputting written commands. These AI-generated images can vary in appearance, offering animation, illustration, and sketch styles, though it does not support the creation of photorealistic images. Users can specify their preferences for the artwork, and ‌Apple Music‌ will produce several options that match the playlist's theme or content.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike other Apple Intelligence features, it is currently unavailable in the beta versions of ‌iOS 18‌. Some Apple Intelligence features have been expected to be included in the summer beta releases, although these references were subsequently removed from Apple's website. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/\">report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, some of these AI features might not launch until 2025. Given that Apple Intelligence has not appeared as of the fourth developer beta, it is unclear how many of its features will make it into the iOS 18.0 release. ‌iOS 18‌ is slated for release in the fall, with a beta preview already accessible to developers and public beta users.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/9to5mac-com/\">9to5Mac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-intelligence-to-generate-playlist-artwork/\">Apple Intelligence to Generate Playlist Artwork in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-to-generate-playlist-artwork-in-ios-18.2432123/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"48578654ece12bc17e1c8aa7c7379e5eeec0533d2b4463af96327f673d2f17e6","category":"Apple"}
