The current model is $449, sitting in the lineup above the $329 ninth-generation ‌iPad‌ that remains in the lineup. The company is likely to phase out this older model and bring the price down of the redesigned model, but Gurman says this \"isn't expected until the end of the year at the earliest.\"</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Seventh-generation iPad mini</strong>: A refreshed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> is said to be in the works featuring improved performance thanks to a faster chip, but it is not due to be announced next week.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>New Macs</strong>: While the new ‌iPad Pro‌ models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/\">may contain the M4 chip</a>, a processor that will later come to the Mac, Apple is not planning to unveil any new Mac models at the \"Let loose\" event.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li><strong>Fourth-generation AirPods</strong>: Apple is said to be nearing production of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/\">fourth-generation AirPods</a>, but these will not launch until the fall alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's \"Let loose\" event is expected to focus on the unveiling of redesigned ‌iPad Pro‌ models with OLED displays, two new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models, a high-end Magic Keyboard accessory, and a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>.
