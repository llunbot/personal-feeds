But Nintendo is still being coy about the specific dimensions of the Switch 2's expanded tablet and Joy-Cons.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the trailer itself features a number of head-on shots of the Switch 2 hardware next to a known quantity—the original Switch Joy-Cons. Using the established measurements of that older controller (<a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/ph/hardware/switch/modal/specs/joy-con.html\">102×35.9 mm</a>) and some Photoshop pixel counting, we can use freeze frames from that trailer to extrapolate a rough size and shape for the Switch 2 hardware.</p>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-1024x474.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-1024x474.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-640x296.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-768x355.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-1536x711.png 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-2048x948.png 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-980x454.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/switch2-size-new-1440x666.png 1440w\" />\n      Using the original Switch Joy-Cons as a reference, we can estimate the size of the Switch 2 shown in the trailer.\n        Credit:\n          Nintendo / Ars Technica\n      \n<p>After spending a good chunk of Thursday performing just those calculations, we're ready to estimate that the Switch 2 hardware features a roughly 7.9-inch screen (measured diagonally), up from 6.2 inches on the Switch and 7 inches on the Switch OLED. We also learned that the Switch tablet itself has a roughly 33 percent larger footprint than that of the original Switch (in terms of total area), while the joysticks on the Switch 2 Joy-Cons have a roughly 26 percent larger diameter than those on the Switch.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce320d1ee578f55dbd8e1179cd285488a5320995918622e609af423b0f7a1a10","category":"Tech"}
