{"title":"A Long-Term Review of the Fox 34 and Fox 36 Grip X Forks – John Watson","link":"https://theradavist.com/fox-34-36-grip-x-review/","date":1739880010000,"content":"<p><em>It’s been almost a full year since John took delivery of both the Fox 34 (in 140 mm) and the Fox 36 (in 160 mm) forks with the new <a href=\"https://ridefox.com/collections/my25-dampers\" target=\"_blank\">Grip X damper</a>. He put these forks on his personal bikes, hoping the frames’ familiarity would assist in dialing in the perfect settings for his daily riding terrain. Read on for his (long) notes on the Grip X damper and how each fork has its seemingly own personality…</em><span></span></p>\n<p><strong>These forks are technically called the 50th Anniversary Limited Edition Podium Gold Fox Factory 34 and 36, but for simplicity’s sake, they’ll be referred to as Fox 34 or Fox 36 in this review.</strong></p>\n<h3>Index of Sections:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#gold-like-a-bass-boat\">Gold Like a Bass Boat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#into-grip-x\">Into Grip X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#grip-x-damper-quick-hits\">Grip X Damper Quick Hits</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#riding-background\">Riding Background</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#grip-x-setup\">Grip X Setup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fox-34-grip-x-quick-hits\">Fox 34 Grip X Quick Hits</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fox-34-grip-x-riding-notes\">Fox 34 Grip X Riding Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fox-36-grip-x-quick-hits\">Fox 36 Grip X Quick Hits</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fox-36-grip-x-riding-notes\">Fox 36 Grip X Riding Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#which-fork-is-right-for-you\">Which Fork is Right For You?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#pros-cons\">TL;DR and Pros &amp; Cons</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rather than rush in with a First Ride review when these forks and the new Grip X damper were announced last April, I thought I’d take these gilded babies for an extended test ride instead. Over ten months, I pushed them to my riding limits and learned about the new Grip X along the way.</p>\n<p>With 20 mm of travel and 2 mm of stanchion diameter separating these two models, there’s a lot to look at. My intent with this post is to position them within the realm of both hardtail and full suspension owners, pointing out pros and cons of the 34 and 36 models at the end.</p>\n<p>Before we do that, can we admire the paint and Kashima anodized coating on these limited-edition forks?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-22.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Gold like a Bass Boat</h3>\n<p>When I unboxed these forks, I blew a high-pitched whistle – in my mind because I’ve yet to master that without the use of two fingers – in complete awe of their finishing work. I imagine that my face glowed from the gold finish as the box opened, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mC1ikwQ5Zgc?si=W46URYvjqedcu4JH&amp;t=73\" target=\"_blank\">like Indiana Jones looking at the idol in Raiders</a>. They are blingy. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZfyrIPw3wY\" target=\"_blank\">Leprechaun-attracting</a>, even.</p>\n<p>Because finish work at such large-scale production feels pretty rare when it comes to suspension, I reached out to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/like_the_wheel/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Estes</a>, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Fox Factory, to hear about the lengths the brand went to in order to achieve this finish.</p>\n<p>Sean and I are buddies, so this might feel more casual than your average media-to-brand conversation:</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about this finish. How long did it take from idea to inception? I remember you saying it was years…</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>It took over two years to do it. I started working on it after those Rootbeer/Pistachio forks in 2020. But then with Covid and everything, we left the project for some time. But I’d say total, dedicated time; it was almost two years.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-23.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-23.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-47a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-47a.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-47a.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-47a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>So, this is powder coat on the fork lowers, right?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes. It’s Prismatic Powder. We started with paint and then cerakote, but the factories were over-spraying, and we were wasting so much media. With powder coat, it’s all static/electrically controlled, so there’s far less powder lost in the process. Remember, it’s not inherently hard to get the Prismatic powder coat color consistent; it’s hard to get something affordable and replicable at a large scale in a factory.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-46.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-46.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-46.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-46.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Getting the anodizing of the Kashima and the powder coat so close must have taken some tricks, though, right?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We played with base coats. It’s a four-stage powder coat color called Gold Bar. It’s a matte powder. Then we went with a gloss clear. The difference is profound when you’re doing the four-stage color, even one coat versus two. The whole concept is to have it match the Kashima coating, which is hard ano, and the way the light plays off it is different than powder. It’s not exact, but it’s as close as we could get it. Fifty samples were made before we got it right, and all in, the whole process took 24 months to perfect.</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Many thanks to Sean for the insight!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-42.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-42.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Into Grip X</h3>\n<p>Let’s check out the Grip X damper that makes these forks perform so damn well.</p>\n<p>The Grip X Damper falls in the new (as of 2024) Fox lineup as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Grip</strong>: Rhythm and Performance-level product only. This is mostly an OEM spec where price is a concern.</li>\n<li><strong>Grip SL</strong>: Fox 32 TC, 32 SC, 34 SC. The Super Light damper is for XC racing and offers 3-position damper controls: open, middle, firm.</li>\n<li><strong>Grip X</strong>: Fox 34, 36, 38. The Grip X is for trail/all-mountain and is the most versatile damper in the line.</li>\n<li><strong>Grip X2</strong>: Fox 36, 38, 40. 120 g heavier than Grip X but is for more aggressive riding, finer tuning, and larger rebound valving. <em>Crème de la crème…</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Grip X Damper Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backward compatibility*</strong> with Fox 34 2021 and Fox 36 2022 models</li>\n<li>15 clicks of high-speed compression</li>\n<li>16 clicks of low-speed compression</li>\n<li>17 clicks of low-speed rebound</li>\n<li>High and low-speed lockout</li>\n<li>You can add volume spacers to the positive air chamber</li>\n<li>There are bleed ports on the back of the lowers for pressure equalization (from atmospheric changes like high elevation riding)</li>\n<li>Weight-saving, slimmed-down rebound circuit</li>\n<li>FIRM MODE – When it’s time to climb, simply rotate the high-speed compression adjuster clockwise until you feel the final distinct click. This closes both high/low-speed compression, creating a firm platform for efficient power transfer to the pedals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>*One note: the Grip X damper is backward compatible with 2021 Fox 34 and 2022 Fox 36 forks. So you could, in essence, buy the older model year forks and upgrade them with Grip X to save some money. I did the math, and it’s around $200 or so depending on fork model.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-18.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Riding Background</h3>\n<p>If I were to categorize my riding preference, it’d most likely fall within the all-mountain category. I relish a long, techy climb almost as much as I enjoy glissading down the scree and baby-head-filled, silty descents here in the Southern Rockies. The chunkier, the better. Nothing puts a bigger smile on my face than navigating this sort of terrain.</p>\n<p>My preference is to ride primitive trails rather than smooth flow trails with jumps, and a majority of my time riding is often climbing singletrack, not fire roads or paved roads. As such, I don’t take advantage of the Grip X damper’s ability to be put into “firm mode,” by rotating the compression dials all the way clockwise.</p>\n<p>That’s not the only feature of Grip X, though. Like a fast aperture lens with stops ranging from ƒ1.2 to ƒ16, the Grip X low-speed compression allows you to find the perfect match for your riding subject. Wide open, the damper is softer, like shooting at a fast aperture like ƒ1.2; closed, it’s a more abrupt, sharper feeling, like that same fast lens stopped down to ƒ16.</p>\n<p>What Grip X offers is an incredible amount of on-the-fly fine-tuning that lets you zen out and tinker with your suspension settings. Unlike the lower-tier Grip and XC-focused Grip SL damper, which only offer three settings (open, middle, and firm), the Grip X offers a staggering 15-16 compression clicks of adjustment across LSC and HSC.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-24.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-24.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Grip_X_Damper_Review_top-of-fork.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Grip_X_Damper_Review_top-of-fork.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Grip_X_Damper_Review_top-of-fork.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Grip_X_Damper_Review_top-of-fork.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Grip X Setup</h3>\n<p>Travis has done an amazing job with our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/shock-value/\" target=\"_blank\">Shock Value</a> series. Even if you’re new to bikes with suspension or just curious, his ability to distill down complex “feeling” subjects into easy-to-digest tutorials is something we all value incredibly here at The Radavist. His writings poured gas on the fire that I felt last year to be more sensitive to suspension settings. His <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/shock-value-mtb-gravel-suspension-setup-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">suspension setup article</a> is a well of knowledge.</p>\n<p>To offer an even more succinct procedure for suspension setup, my go-to method – as outlined in my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/johns-favorite-products-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">2024 Year In Review post</a> – is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, I open up the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/shock-value-glossary/#:~:text=the%20raised%20pivot.-,High%2Dspeed%20damping,-Note%20that%20this\" target=\"_blank\">high/low-speed compression</a>, turning the damper all the way counter-clockwise until it stops.</li>\n<li>I set my spring rate by choosing 20% sag according to my weight as Fox supplies on the fork leg chart.</li>\n<li>Set low-speed compression, beginning with a manufacturer’s suggestion.</li>\n<li>To set high-speed compression, I’ll open it all the way up and dial it in for the appropriate support during abrupt impacts on technical/high-speed descents.</li>\n<li>To finish it off, I’ll set <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/shock-value-glossary/#:~:text=small%2Dbump%20sensitivity-,Rebound%20damping,-The%20system%20that\" target=\"_blank\">rebound</a> last.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This applies to Grip X in both the 34 and 36 fork models, which offer two distinct riding characteristics outlined below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-54.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Fox 34 Grip X Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>140 mm reviewed here</li>\n<li>Retail <strong>$999</strong></li>\n<li>29er only</li>\n<li>Travel*: 130 mm or 140 mm</li>\n<li>44 mm offset</li>\n<li>Grip X damper with high-speed compression, low-speed compression, and low-speed rebound controls</li>\n<li>Factory Series Kashima coating</li>\n<li>Lower leg internal bypass channels offer more usable travel by increasing air volume within the lower legs</li>\n<li>EVOL air spring with enlarged negative air spring to assist with mid-stroke support</li>\n<li>180mm to 203mm rotor compatible post mount</li>\n<li>Lightweight Kabolt thru-axle</li>\n<li>Tapered threadless steerer</li>\n<li>2.6″ max tire size</li>\n<li>Starting weight <strong>1686 g (confirmed)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>*A Fox 34 can technically be built down to 120 mm travel, but it is not offered as a stock configuration…</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Fox 34 Grip X Riding Notes: The Hardtail Champion</h3>\n<p>The Fox 34 gets its designation from the stanchion diameter of 34 mm. It’s offered as a 130 or 140 mm fork. My test mule for this fork is my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/beautiful-builds-retrotec-funduro/\" target=\"_blank\">Retrotec Funduro</a>, a 140 mm hardtail that is far from modern in terms of its geometry but offers an incredibly playful ride quality with a slightly higher bottom bracket, slacker seat tube, and a steeper head angle with high stack.</p>\n<p>Setting up Grip X was a cinch. Using the above procedure, I dialed in the middle ground. Right off the bat, I began to fine-tune the low-speed compression for steep, rocky terrain that eventually smooths out into a swoopy, smoother trail. What I quickly discovered was that low-speed compression and its fine, indexed adjustment determine how this fork sits within its travel. And this is way more noticeable on a hardtail!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Zooming through corners with a high bottom bracket takes some finesse, but the 34 helps keep the bike planted… </em></p>\n<p>I found it to offer the most traction and support in loose, rocky turns where the front wheel wants to wash out across golf-ball-sized alluvium. As a bigger rider who lives in steep terrain, I wanted my low speed compression to be on the slower side of things. My everyday settings ended up with 4-6 clicks from open on low speed for more overall riding support and 7-8 clicks from open on high speed for an increase in support during abrupt impacts, like hitting a water bar or bump-jumping a rock.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-20.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-20.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-21.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-21.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The new Grip X allows for a ride experience where the initial few millimeters of travel are very soft. This creates a unique damping sensation, particularly before the fork begins to cycle on impact. There’s no abrupt or sharp ramping up through this moment. It’s like hitting a tack with a rubber mallet versus a nail with a 25 oz framing hammer.</p>\n<p>I mostly ride the same lunch loop daily, which is a byproduct of always testing a product or bike and my limited day-to-day time. My 1.5-hour ride has it all, and I know every rock on the trail, so noticing idiosyncrasies makes testing even easier. During my first few rides, I questioned if the 34 chassis was stiff enough for my riding style.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Having come from a Fox 36 (which we’ll get to in a bit), the 34 was visibly flexing down rocky chutes and rooty lines ridden at my fastest speeds, like how a tortoise feels “fast” if it were to ever crest a dune and slide down the other side. It was initially distracting, watching it move fore and aft as it impacted and moved through its travel. I couldn’t keep my eyes off it.</p>\n<p><em>The 34, like the 36, also emits a hissing or off-gassing sound when you’re ricocheting off of rocks in sequential order, adding to the distraction of the flexy lowers. This occurs because of the rebound oil flowing through the rebound circuit. In the Grip X, the rebound circuit is scaled down to save weight since the performance isn’t as essential as compression. It’s noisier because you’re moving the same amount of oil through a smaller mechanism for Grip X. The trade-off, of course, is the damper is lighter-weight.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>At one point, I even reached out to my contact at Fox, asking if I could rebuild the Fox 36 I was also testing at the same time down to 140 mm travel from 160 mm to ride on the Retrotec.</p>\n<p>Not wanting to bail on this experiment, I spent even more time on it and adjusted my riding style ever so slightly, and the fork really held its own. While it obviously didn’t become stiffer, I quickly realized that didn’t matter. It offered support and predictability functionally when it mattered most, even if it lacked that <em>visually</em>. The fork flexing was merely a visual distraction. I couldn’t <em>feel</em> it flex as it moved through its 140 mm of travel. There was no braking chatter, no clunky, or flat sensations to it, either. It was tuned and alive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Fox 34 felt active and smooth, offering plenty of support thanks to the fine-tuned low-speed compression adjustment, and, even for a 34 mm stanchion fork, it was incredibly responsive. What was perhaps most intriguing to me is how crucial a fork’s settings are on a hardtail as the bike’s geometry is altered more acutely since there is no rear shock to settle into. On top of that, all of my traction comes from the front wheel’s contact patch, as I tend to slide the rear around as needed into proper line alignment.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-15.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Getting it to ride “perfectly” was a trail-side Rubik’s Cube I was willing to click and click until it all… well, <em>clicked</em>.

Big time. The Fox 36, unlike the Fox 34, was a fork I could turn off my mindfulness of line-picking and just let it do its thing. It allows the bike to plow through the inconsistencies found in the chunky terrain I love so much while offering an amazing amount of control when you want the bike to leave the ground, too.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because of the stiffer and more supported feel, I landed on slightly different settings, including overall sag on the Fox 36.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-32.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-32.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With the Fox 34, I landed on around 20% sag to fully utilize the travel and achieve the plush yet supported ride quality I ended up vibing with on the Retrotec hardtail. On the Fox 36, I ended up with the sag a bit softer, around 25%. Part of the reason for this is I just ride my Starling Murmur, a 140 mm rear travel and 160 mm front travel bike, faster, and with the Grip X, I have the ability to finely tune the low- and high-speed compression. But I want to make sure I’m using all of my travel. On the 160 mm fork, I have more travel to move through, and most of that gets used on abrupt hits. Which is where high-speed compression comes in.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-39.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I ride my Murmur differently than my Retrotec. I go faster, in general, and tend to plow more, versus picking smoother lines and jibbing on the Retrotec. As I outlined in my setup procedure, I’ll set high-speed compression on the trail, based on ride feel. If the fork feels sluggish or too squishy on hits, I’ll add two clicks of high-speed compression. I’ll want the end product to feel sure-footed and supportive after landing from a jump, or more importantly, hitting a big rock. The last thing you want is a soft-feeling fork recovering from an abrupt impact.</p>\n<p>The Murmur also has a rear shock, offering more rear-wheel traction, which my riding style relies heavily upon. Rather than being over the front like I am on the Retrotec, engaging the front wheel’s contact patch, on the Murmur, I’m more actively engaging the front and rear suspension, riding in the middle of the bike, at any point being eager to compress the suspension to jib around.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My goal was to adjust the Fox 36 slightly firmer, so I added a single token to the fork to make it a bit stiffer at the end of its travel. After tuning the fork, I ended up prioritizing the low-speed compression damping by turning the adjuster clockwise a few clicks at a time to provide better control in the fast and loose chunk. Adding low-speed compression damping decreases the perceived suspension sensitivity, so I try not to overdo it. Just enough support, not more.</p>\n<p>I then moved through the more open high-speed compression numbers, landing slightly higher to absorb larger hits like impacts and for sending rock bump jumps and booters deep at fast speeds. Last but not least, I actually found the rebound best dialed dead in the middle, slightly faster for really rocky stuff and slower for jumpy/smooth terrain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28a.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28a.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It’s impossible for me to “turn off” my work mind while I’m riding. Mainly when I’m on a bike that I know very well on terrain that I ride every day. If you could heat map my lines, they’d be damn near close to overlapping, too. I split 4″ gaps between rocks like second nature on this ride and know exactly where the lips are the firmest on the side hits.</p>\n<p>This a by-product of the fact that we didn’t get to travel all that much to ride last year, so I spent the past nine months frothing over this sort of minutiae that, honestly, I never felt the desire for before. After a few months of tinkering with the Fox 36 Grip X, my settings ended up at 8-9 clicks from open on low speed for more overall riding support and 10-11 clicks from open for high-speed compression for my day-to-day rides.</p>\n<p>For the first few months, I went back and forth a lot, trying less LSC and HSC, but I found the Fox 36 liked being more constricted for my riding style and terrain. If I backed off the LSC and HSC too much, it felt too plush and lost its support in steep and rocky terrain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-29.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Finding the sweet spot on the Fox 36 felt like getting a power-up, and because the settings were plentiful, I was able to use my lunch ride as a testing ground, running the gamut through the Grip X’s possibilities. What is most outstanding about this fork – and I’m trying to tamp down my excitement – is the plentiful compression indexing. If something just feels “off,” within a few minutes, you can dial in your preferred experience, and off you go.</p>\n<p>My detail-oriented brain really started to take note of any ride inconsistencies. Unlike bodily inconsistencies like being sore or tired, I could rely on the front travel of my Murmur to be familiar, and if something was off, I was in control of that with a few simple clicks. <em>Now, where are the clicks to adjust my fatigue?!</em></p>\n<p>I felt like the Fox 36 was more damped during fast hits and more supportive during recovery. Between the next set of hits, the chassis stiffness helped to control the Murmur in a way that was more aligned with my faster-paced line choices. This was very noticeable when you launched into a rocky corner at a (relative) high speed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-35.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-35.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Which Fork is Right For You?</h3>\n<p>In the end, I’m glad I didn’t rebuild the Fox 36 to 140 mm travel for the Retrotec. I found the Fox 34 kept the bike even-keeled without it feeling too front-heavy, as I’ve found with longer travel hardtails with bigger stanchions. It pings and plops down the trail in a predictable manner and, with the right settings, keeps its bounding playfulness in line with the bike’s temperament.</p>\n<p>A hardtail, for me anyway, isn’t about riding like a full-suspension. It opens a new line path on the trail. I don’t go as big or as fast and usually opt for the path of least resistance, emphasizing smooth, clean riding, throwing in some jibs here or there.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-37.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-37.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-37.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-37.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-38.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-38.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Fox 36, on the other hand, was best utilized as a high-speed bulldozer. Whereas on the 34, I might veer to avoid a soccer ball-sized rock, on the 36, I’d plop over it. It’s a bit heftier, with more travel, and the wider stanchions support the kind of riding it induces.</p>\n<p>There is certainly a world where a 36 makes sense on a 150 or 160mm travel hardtail. But I don’t see a world where I would want a 34 on a full-suspension trail bike, which might be the lone controversial point in this whole review.  Personally, I’d rather have the extra stiffness to be able to plant and control a full-suspension with its extra traction, thanks to the rear shock.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I ride the two bikes very differently; one like a big BMX, jibbing nonstop all the way down the trail, and one like a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/C0DO93fnwrI?si=rbguuYafenj_VjiU&amp;t=5\" target=\"_blank\">desert racing trophy truck</a>. Having extra stiffness on the front wheel with the 36 made the bike feel more sure-footed at higher speeds.</p>\n<p>Modern suspension is as good as it gets. I can’t imagine more clicks of compression or much more advancement on the way compared to the past thirty years of tech we’ve already achieved. These forks are worlds apart from the suspension I learned to ride in the early aughts.</p>\n<p>From here on out, I imagine some future bifurcation with the 34 product line. There’s already the 34 Step-Cast, which is the lighter weight for racing-focused riders, and the current Fox 34 Grip X is great for the general trail rider, but what about a beefier option for others who like the 34 mm stanchions but want a bit more stiffness and don’t mind a slight weight penalty?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-36.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-36.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-36.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Through almost a year of testing and tinkering with my trailside LSC and HSC settings, I found the Grip X to be incredibly supportive mid-range on its indexing range.
