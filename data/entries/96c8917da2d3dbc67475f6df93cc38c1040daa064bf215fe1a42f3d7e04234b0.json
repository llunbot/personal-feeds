{"title":"Ostensibly Private Twitter Circle Tweets Are Being Shown Publicly","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/10/twitter-circle-bug-not-private/?guccounter=1","date":1681169641000,"content":"\n<p>Amanda Silberling, writing for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Numerous Twitter users are reporting a bug in which Circle tweets — which are supposed to reach a select group, like an Instagram\n<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/how-instagram-close-friends-works/\">Close Friends</a> story — are surfacing on the\nalgorithmically generated <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/24/twitter-wont-force-you-to-the-for-you-timeline-on-web-anymore/\">For You</a> timeline. That means\nthat your supposedly private posts might breach containment to\nreach an unintended audience, which could quickly spark some\nuncomfortable situations.</p>\n\n<p>I observed this bug when a tweet from someone I follow appeared on\nmy For You timeline, but the retweet button was disabled, despite\nthe person’s account being public. When I clicked on the tweet, it\ndisappeared. I asked the tweeter if that post was intended for\ntheir Circle — which I am not in — and they confirmed this was\nthe case. [...]</p>\n\n<p>TechCrunch has spoken to multiple users who have also experienced\nthis glitch firsthand; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamjmoussa/status/1644460901779615745\">many</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AC3ATTORN3Y/status/1644526438786146304\">more</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ERnurse86/status/1644733902840365060\">have</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaricCott/status/1644541029641752578\">reported</a> the glitch in their tweets. Most often, it seems\nthat Circle tweets are being surfaced in the For You timeline to\nusers who follow the poster, but are not in their Circle. Others\nhave reported that their Circle tweets are reaching even further\nthan those who follow them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other privacy-related bugs I’ve seen people mention recently:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1639297936499658753\">Will Oremus saw tweets in his timeline from people who had blocked him</a>.</li>\n<li>Ian Coldwater, testing the privacy of Twitter Circles, created a circle with just one other person, sent a tweet to that circle, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1645468617394331649\">and it was shown to several people not in the circle</a>.</li>\n<li>Replying to Coldwater, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wbm312/status/1645497243708067841\">Whitney Merrill argues that this is a data breach under EU law</a>, and could result in hefty fines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don’t trust anything “private” about Twitter, including and especially DMs. Some kind of breach regarding DMs seems inevitable at this point, given how sloppy Twitter is getting under Phony Stark.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/10/twitter-circle\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"96c8917da2d3dbc67475f6df93cc38c1040daa064bf215fe1a42f3d7e04234b0","category":"Tech"}
