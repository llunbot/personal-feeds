{"title":"Shakeup in the App Store Top Downloads List","link":"https://spyglass.org/top-of-the-app-store-pops-2/","date":1738030618000,"content":"\n<p>MG Siegler, writing at Spyglass:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anyway, this matters because it doesn’t mean that DeepSeek, an app\nbased off of the Chinese-developed AI model of the same name, is\nthe most popular app ever despite its current place atop the\ncharts. Your mom probably isn’t downloading it. Just as last week,\nyour mom probably wasn’t <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/dispatch-042-tiktok-twitter/#:~:text=%2D%2D%20Candacce%2C,in%20social%20media.\">downloading Xiaohongshu</a> (‘<a href=\"https://spyglass.org/dispatch-043-bromo-sapiens/#:~:text=%F0%9F%95%9A%20TikTok%20Prepares,%3F%20%5BInformation%20%F0%9F%94%92%5D\">Little\nRed Book</a>’), incidentally another Chinese app that rose to\nthe top of the charts. But it is still interesting because again,\nthe mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure,\nnew entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was\nalmost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp,\nThreads, TikTok, CapCut, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. Right\nnow, there is only a single app from Meta (Threads) and one from\nGoogle (Google) in the top 10.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we have the aforementioned DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Paramount+,\nTemu, Fox Sports, Bluesky, ReelShort, and VPN rounding out the top\n10. It’s pretty easy to see why each of these has risen: interest\nin AI, interest in sports around the NFL playoffs, interest in\nTwitter-like social networks given <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/a-time-to-kill-twitter/\">the Xitter situation</a>,\nand yes, <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/twittertok/\">the TikTok ban</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The specific reasons are varied, but altogether it really is true that, for the moment at least, there’s a serious shakeup atop the App Store top free downloads list. That’s interesting for several reasons.</p>\n\n<p>DeepSeek is at #1 and ChatGPT #2. That’s great for “AI” but a bad look for OpenAI at the moment. I can’t help but think that DeepSeek having rocketed to the top spot, seemingly (<a href=\"https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1226\">but not actually</a>) out of nowhere helped drive today’s stock market reaction. (Google Gemini is down at #14.)</p>\n\n<p>Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple’s strength in AI. Sure, Apple’s own Apple Intelligence is years behind and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber\">pretty embarrassing</a> right now, even <em>with</em> its much ballyhooed partnership with ChatGPT. But the iPhone is where people actually use AI and the App Store is how they get the apps they use. To borrow Ben Thompson’s framing, the hype over DeepSeek taking the top spot in the App Store <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/wwdc-apple-intelligence-apple-aggregates-ai/\">reinforces Apple’s role as an aggregator of AI</a>. The measuring stick for consumer AI products <em>and</em> social media networks is where they’re listed on the App Store. Not app stores, lowercase. <em>The</em> App Store. Apple’s. That’s The Show, the Major Leagues. So sure, it’d be better for Apple users and Apple shareholders, and thus better for Apple itself, if Apple’s own AI was at least sort of kind of competitive, rather than the butt of jokes. Aside from the easily forgotten iTunes Ping 15 years ago, Apple hasn’t even <em>tried</em> to offer its own social media platform. But the iPhone is <em>the</em> place where social media networks are used and ranked. The App Store today is like the cable company of yore. It didn’t matter if Comcast’s own channels were the most popular — so long as everyone was watching channels through TVs connected to Comcast TV service, Comcast was getting their cut.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, when it comes to Meta: Threads is #3 (the people arguing that Threads is a bust sure are quiet lately), Instagram is down to #16 (not great if they were hoping for a bounce from TikTok’s questionable future), WhatsApp #17 (not bad on iOS in the US, where iMessage is strongest) and Facebook is ... scroll, scroll, scroll ... #32, just behind Walmart and Microsoft Teams. 32 isn’t that far ahead of X, which clocks in at #41. Facebook might never die, but we seem to be watching it fade away.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"488d36f041bc0c674876d6ff7797f65b033269480fe2a63bb04e63ece7a5971e","category":"Tech"}
