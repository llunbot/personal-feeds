Among the new features coming to Macs are iPhone mirroring, which puts your iPhone screen on your Mac’s display and lets you interact with it via your mouse and keyboard, a new Video conferencing presenter preview, and changes to Safari. In addition, developers will be easily able to port games between iPhone, Mac, and iPad. Read on for the lowdown on all the new features and improvements coming later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This free software update will bring a raft of interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about macOS 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developer beta will be released on June 10 and we will discuss the latest versions of the beta and how to get your hands on that below and in separate articles. We will also explain when the final version of macOS 15 will come out, how to get it when it does, which Mac models will be able to run macOS 15, and the features that will be added in the new OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 name: What will the new version be called?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since Apple stopped using jungle cats with macOS 10.9 Mavericks, it’s used California places to identify its annual OS updates. The last several years have been Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina. Apple has trademarked several unused place names, including Condor, Mammoth, Redwood, and Sequoia – so the name Sequoia was expected to appear at some point. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS 15 is likely to arrive in the week of Monday, September 16, 2024, although Apple is yet to confirm the release date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final version of macOS 15 will be released to the general public in the fall. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships, although in 2023 the macOS release came sooner than was usual. Here are the release dates for the previous five versions of macOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 10.14 Mojave: September 24, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As in 2023 we may see macOS 15 arrive in September, around the time of iOS 18, possibly September 23. But we may be waiting until late October, perhaps October 21, 2024 for the launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final release comes out, installing macOS 15 will be a breeze. Open System Settings and go to General &gt; Software Update; macOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">macOS updating guide</a>. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 beta release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple began the beta program soon after it revealed the details of macOS 15 at WWDC. The developer beta is available for anyone who wants to run the beta, but it should be noted that this early beta is very likely to be buggy, so we don’t recommend installing it on a primary device. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">How to install the Mac beta</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will release a public beta in July that will be a little more polished than the developer beta, but still likely to be buggy as it is pre-release software. In 2023 Apple Apple released the first public beta of macOS 14 on July 12 so a similar date is likely for the macOS public beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beta testing will continue even after Apple releases macOS 15 to the general public as Apple develops new features not available at launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to join the beta for the next version of macOS read this: How to join Apple’s beta program and try out new software. If you want to remove the beta from your device read this: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove a beta from your Mac</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install the macOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. Since June 2023 Apple has opened the beta to all registered developers–so now everyone can get the earliest possible access to the macOS beta without paying a penny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer you can wait for the Public Beta – which is likely to be more stable than the developer beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program</a> separately, including details of how to get a free developer account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once registered, when you go to System Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. For example, if you want to install the developer beta select macOS 15 Public Beta, alternatively, if it’s the public beta you want, select macOS 15 Public Beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: betas are not as stable as the official version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install the beta, follow our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">macOS beta installation guide</a>. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove macOS beta</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program for more advice</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 compatibility: Which Macs will be able to run macOS 15?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following Macs get support for macOS 15, although it is possible that not all of them will support all of the new features</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iMac from 2019 and later </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro from 2019 and later </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iMac Pro from 2017 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Studio from 2022 and later </li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Air from 2018 and later </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini from 2018 and later </li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Pro from 2018 and later</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the new features won’t run on older Macs on the list. Some new features – especially AI related features – may also require Apple chips and not run on Intel- based Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some Macs will not be able to run macOS 15, Apple will still provide security updates for those models. Generally Apple provides software updates for the past two versions of macOS. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html\">How long does Apple support Macs</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, Macs get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1997296/intel-mac-support-compatibility-apple-silicon.html\">6.6 years of macOS updates</a>, with models older than that only receiving another year or two of security updates and bug fixes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The compatibility list is becoming a pressing concern for users of Intel Macs. After Apple introduced its M-series Macs, the company said it will continue to support Intel Macs for several years, but it did not offer specifics. The last Mac to switch from Intel to Apple Silicon was the Mac Pro last year. The clock is ticking on Intel Macs, but it’s likely that the last generation of Intel Macs will be on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS 15 compatibility list</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple launched its first M1 Macs (MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro Mac mini) in late 2020, so some Intel models will still get another year of updates with macOS 15. the most likely candidates to drop support are the 2018 models and the iMac Pro. To find out which version of macOS and older Mac can run take a look at our macOS compatibility list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many new features in macOS 14 Sonoma including changes to Widgets, a new Game Mode, the ability to easily turn web pages into web apps, and fun additions to video conferencing apps. Rumors suggested that there wouldn’t be many new features in macOS 15, with AI related improvements in iOS 18 taking most of the development focus. However, there are some interesting improvements coming including iPhone mirroring on your Mac display, a new Presenter Preview for video conferencing apps, and Game Porting Toolkit 2 for porting games between Mac, iPhone and iPad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has announced numerous new features for the update which we will describe below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all the new features will be available at launch though. Some new features will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone mirroring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This development of Continuity sees the Mac able to connect to an iPhone and display the iPhone screen on the Mac’s display. Users will be able to see what is on their iPhone and control it – even if it is in another room. You can also mirror the iPhone in a window on you Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While interacting wirelessly with your iPhone on your Mac you will be able to use your phone normally. Open any iPhone app. Use Mac trackpad to interact with the iPhone. Use the Mac keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also receive iPhone notifications on a Mac. They will appear alongside Mac notifications. You can interact with these even when you don’t have access to your iPhone. Click on a notification and be taken into the app on iPhone. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"View iPhone on Mac screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"View iPhone on Mac screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"View iPhone on Mac screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-iPhone-on-Mac-screen.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Here’s what else we expected:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AI everywhere</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Several reports over the past few months have stated that Apple is doing a lot of work towards AI, and that generative AI (using AI to create content) will have a big role in macOS. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2113912/apple-generative-ai-siri-suggested-replies-ios-18.html\">reported</a> in October 2023 that AI will be prominently featured in iOS 18 with macOS following at a later date. That seems to indicate that macOS 15 won’t get as many AI features as iOS 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If macOS 15 doesn’t match iOS 18 feature for feature, it’s not known when Apple will bring those missing features over. It could decide to introduce them in updates throughout the year or wait until macOS 16 in 2025. iOS has long been Apple’s priority, so it won’t be surprising if macOS 15 doesn’t have the same new features as iOS 18. However, it’s nearly certain that macOS will have some new AI features baked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman reported that Apple is going to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more&amp;xcust=1-1-2360223-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2360223/wwdc24-ai-artificial-apple-intelligence.html\">refer to its AI feature set as “Apple Intelligence.”</a> One key characteristic of these features is that users will have to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2357953/iphone-mac-openai-chatgpt-siri-opt-in-service.html\">opt-in to use them</a>. Gurman also reports that Macs will need at least an M1 chip or later. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A report by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/&amp;xcust=1-1-2265062-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors</a> states the macOS 15 will have several new Accessibility features. These include Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, which activates accessibility features by speaking a phrase; a Live Speech enhancement that lets users create categories; and expanded app support for custom font sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Freeform Scenes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/ios-18-macos-15-freeform-app-scenes/&amp;xcust=1-1-2265062-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors</a> reports that the Freeform app will get a new feature called Freeform Scenes, which will let the user select specific sections on boards to ease navigation. Scenes will reportedly work with iCloud for sharing and editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Redesigned Calculator app</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2309958/macos-15-new-featrues-calculator-app.html\">AppleInsider</a> reports that Apple is working on a new Calculator app. It may be redesigned to resemble the iOS version, with new features including a history tape, revamped conversions, and a resizable window.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari 18</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320446/safari-ai-features-rumors-ios-18-macos-15.html\">AppleInsider</a> reports that Safari 18, which will be in macOS 15, will include several new features, including AI-enhanced “Intelligent Search,” a “Web Eraser,” and a new page controls menu. An update in 2025 will provide an AI enhancement to Visual Lookup not just in Safari, but throughout the OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Calendar and Reminders sync</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/01/apples-ios-18-to-streamline-task-management-with-unified-events-and-reminders&amp;xcust=1-1-2265062-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AppleInsider</a> reports that the Calendar app will allow users to manage reminders from within the Calendar app, which will also have minor UI changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>System Settings UI tweaks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2343754/systems-settings-to-get-an-interface-tune-up-in-macos-15.html\">AppleInsider</a> reports that System Settings will have UI changes to make it easier for users to quickly get to frequently-accessed settings.</p>\n\nMac, MacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dda4684623a7532e548f133ce2bf53f97a10482d9641bec9a51a70d5d92de859","category":"Apple"}
