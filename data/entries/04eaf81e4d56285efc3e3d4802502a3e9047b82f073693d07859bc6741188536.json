But if you want to emulate retro PC games on your iOS device, you are apparently still out of luck.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://litchie.com/2024/04/new-hope\">a recent blog update</a>, iDOS developer Chaoji Li said that the latest version of <a href=\"https://litchie.com/dospad\">the DOSBox-based MS-DOS emulator</a> was finally rejected from the iOS App Store this month after a lengthy, two-month review process:</p>\n<blockquote><p>They have decided that iDOS is not a retro game console, so the new rule is not applicable. They suggested I make changes and resubmit for review, but when I asked what changes I should make to be compliant, they had no idea, nor when I asked what a retro game console is. It's still the same old unreasonable answer along the line of \"we know it when we see it.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>The developer of <a href=\"https://getutm.app/\">iOS Virtual Machine app UTM</a> told a similar tale of App Store rejection <a href=\"https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1799647652134654045\">on social media</a>. The reported two-month review process for the UTM app ended with \"the App Store review board determin[ing] that 'PC is not a console' regardless of the fact that there are retro Windows/DOS games fo[r] the PC that UTM SE can be useful in running,\" the developer said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033688#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033688&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04eaf81e4d56285efc3e3d4802502a3e9047b82f073693d07859bc6741188536","category":"Tech"}
