Since Android games are mostly casual pay-to-win tap fests, though, we often <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/the-asus-rog-3-is-the-ultimate-android-gaming-phone-that-nobody-asked-for/\">have to ask</a>, does anyone want a gaming smartphone? If you're Lenovo, the answer is apparently \"no,\" as <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/lenovo-legion-phone-shutdown-3306942/\">Android Authority</a> reports Lenovo is killing the \"Legion\" gaming phone business.</p>\n<p>The site quoted a Lenovo spokesperson:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lenovo is discontinuing its Android-based Legion mobile gaming phones as part of a wider business transformation and gaming portfolio consolidation. As a leader in gaming devices and solutions, Lenovo is committed to advancing the gaming category across form factors, as well as focusing on where it can bring the most value to the global gaming community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While gaming phones often seem like a product without a market, we are a bit sad to see Lenovo pack it in since the Lenovo <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/lenovos-gaming-phone-has-an-extreme-dual-fan-cooling-system/\">Legion Phone Duel 2</a> was the most extreme version of the idea. That phone had what must have been the most powerful cooling system ever fitted to an Android phone, with two internal cooling fans, copper heat pipes, and loads of graphite pads. While most passively cooled Android phones would quickly throttle in a graphics-intensive game, this was one of the rare phones with what looked like sustainable cooling. Of course, it didn't fit into a normal smartphone body—the phone's center (in landscape) was about twice as thick as normal, but it was a neat product.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927757#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927757&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"946937f6762fa5c78e12ff8b26e1a8afa63c0ec2d19d0c6306a70be3ebc77d5d","category":"Tech"}
