This means that you might intend to add “Jeffrey Pixenwald” to a group chat and instead invite “Jenny Hickenlooper” by typing “Je.” It happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great general place to start when inadvertently selecting the wrong person is your Contacts list. This list may contain people you’ve only connected with once years ago. Delete unwanted entries. You can also clear out the macOS Mail app’s list of suggestions, which I explain below in the Mail section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More generally, consider the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Slow down when selecting contacts from autocomplete suggestions to ensure you read what’s suggested.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Always double-check recipients before sending a message or email.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type the full name for important or sensitive messages rather than relying on autocomplete. This avoids any accidental overlap, even though it’s tedious.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is more app-specific advice on how to avoid autocomplete filling in the names, phone numbers, and email addresses of people you didn’t intend to include in your communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Messages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start typing letters into the To: field in Messages on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, Apple tries to help by ordering the suggestions by how recently you’ve messaged someone. Matches are made by name or email address. This means that the first choice is often the best for the letters you entered, and the top suggestions are almost always sensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the people with whom you recently interacted, Messages lists all other entries in your contact list (for first name, last name, or email) in alphabetical order by first name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messages in iOS and iPadOS shows another list of suggestions following a break with the label “Siri Found in Apps.” You can disable Siri Suggestions in <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>(Apple Intelligence &amp;) Siri</em> &gt; <em>Apps</em> &gt; <em>Messages</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ios-18-messages-siri-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 18 Siri Messages Settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ios-18-messages-siri-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ios-18-messages-siri-settings.jpg?resize=300%2C147&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ios-18-messages-siri-settings.jpg?resize=768%2C376&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ios-18-messages-siri-settings.jpg?resize=1200%2C588&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ios-18-messages-siri-settings.jpg?resize=1536%2C753&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ios-18-messages-siri-settings.jpg?resize=2048%2C1004&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"588\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Messages has a setting for Siri Suggestions, which is found in the (Apple Intelligence &amp;) Siri options of Settings. (Click to enlarge the image.)</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In macOS, Messages selects the top choice, effectively autocompleting it, and you can press Return to accept it without review. For the safest way to add people, I suggest training yourself to not press Return and instead click the address you want. In iOS and iPadOS, you have to tap to select a recipient, which requires more deliberation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mail similarly provides suggestions ordered by recent interactions and then alphabetically as you start to type. macOS autocompletes the first item as the best match by selecting it. In iOS and iPadOS, as in Messages, you have to tap to select a match. Mail for iPhone and iPad includes Siri suggestions at the bottom, which you can disable via Settings &gt; (Apple Intelligence &amp;) Siri &gt; Apps &gt; Mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t control this any further on an iPhone or iPad, but Mail on a Mac has an additional source of suggestions and a way to restrict that list. Choose <em>Window &gt; Previous Recipients</em>. This often lengthy list contains every person who you have emailed in the past with the date of the last time a message was sent from the Mail app to them. You can trim this list to avoid suggestions from it: select or search for individual entries or choose <em>Edit &gt; Select All</em> and click Remove From List. (In the past, some readers have found suggestions continue to appear from this list even after deleting entries.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Mail previous recipients\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/macos-mail-previous-recipients.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Mail for macOS also draws suggested recipients from its record of all previous recipients.

Instead, you have to click or tap to select a displayed entry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one place Signal can bite you–as it did certain members of the current American administration–is that people’s names and addresses are imported from your contacts unless added manually. A profile image is only shown if that’s found in Contacts. Otherwise, two initials appear, like GF or RL. That can lead you to select someone in haste by noticing their initials and not their full name.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-signal-addressing-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-signal-addressing-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-signal-addressing-bordered.png?resize=300%2C196&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-signal-addressing-bordered.png?resize=768%2C501&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-signal-addressing-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C783&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-signal-addressing-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C1003&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"783\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Signal matches by name but never autoselects.
