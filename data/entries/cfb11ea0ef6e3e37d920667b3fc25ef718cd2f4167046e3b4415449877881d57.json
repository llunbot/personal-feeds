{"title":"iOS 15.2 Beta Includes the ‘Communication Safety’ Messages Feature for Children","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/","date":1636658576000,"content":"\n<p>Juli Clover, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Communication Safety is a Family Sharing feature that can be\nenabled by parents, and it is opt-in rather than activated by\ndefault. When turned on, the Messages app is able to detect nudity\nin images that are sent or received by children. If a child\nreceives or attempts to send a photo with nudity, the image will\nbe blurred and the child will be warned about the content, told\nit’s okay not to view the photo, and offered resources to contact\nsomeone they trust for help.</p>\n\n<p>When Communication Safety was first announced, Apple said that\nparents of children under the age of 13 had the option to receive\na notification if the child viewed a nude image in Messages, but\nafter receiving feedback, Apple has removed this feature. Apple\nnow says that no notifications are sent to parents.</p>\n\n<p>Apple removed the notification option because it was suggested\nthat parental notification could pose a risk for a child in a\nsituation where there is parental violence or abuse. For all\nchildren, including those under the age of 13, Apple will instead\noffer guidance on getting help from a trusted adult in a situation\nwhere nude photos are involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems like a good middle ground to address the above-stated concerns.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/11/ios-15-2-communication-safety\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cfb11ea0ef6e3e37d920667b3fc25ef718cd2f4167046e3b4415449877881d57","category":"Tech"}
