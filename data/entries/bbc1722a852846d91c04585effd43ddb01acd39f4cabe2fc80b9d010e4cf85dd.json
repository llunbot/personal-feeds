Apple does offer <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">year-round discounts to students</a>, including a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">Back To School event</a> where further-education students can get up to $150 in gift cards when purchasing certain Apple products (this giveaway will be running in the southern hemisphere between January to March). There’s also the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Refurbished Store</a> where you can sometimes grab a bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you want a new Apple device right now, other stores often offer up Apple discounts worth grabbing. In this article, you’ll find the top discounts we’ve seen. Plus, for even more deals, we’ve linked to our dedicated deals round-ups for each product category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the table of contents to jump to the best deals right now for the Apple product you want—including the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, iPad mini, and all the M4 Macs, which were announced this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best AirPods deals</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5039w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods</a> were announced by Apple in September 2024. We saw some deals on the AirPods 4 over Black Friday, and, at least in the U.S., those discounts appear to be continuing for now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the launch of new AirPods, the AirPods 2nd-gen and AirPods 3rd-gen were discontinued. You may therefore see deals on those older products until stock runs out, however, we recommend that instead of buying discounted AirPods 3 you consider the even cheaper AirPods 4 without ANC, which start at $129/£129. The AirPods 2 would have to have a really low price to make them a good deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also introduced a USB-C equipped AirPods Max in new colors and discontinued the older Lightning-equipped models. If you see the Lightning model at a good discount it’s worth buying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C case)</a>: $189 ($59 off, MSRP $249)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods 4:</a> $119 ($10 off, MSRP $129)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods 4 with ANC</a>: $169 ($10 off, MSRP $179)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>B&amp;H Photo, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHYDZSD\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Max (USB-C)</a>: $529 ($20 off, MSRP $549)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Max (Lightning)</a>: $513 ($72 off; MSRP $549 – <strong>Clearance</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Argos, <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1152562\">AirPods (3rd gen, 2021, MagSafe)</a>: £139 (£40 off, RRP was £179–<strong>Clearance</strong>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Argos, <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1245929\">AirPods (3rd gen, 2021, Lightning)</a>: £129 (£40 off, RRP was £169–<strong>Clearance</strong>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Argos, <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8814322\">AirPods (2nd gen, 2019)</a>: £109 (£20 off, RRP was £129–<strong>Clearance</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>See our dedicated round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673507/best-airpods-deals.html\">best AirPods deals</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best iPhone and accessory deals</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 Home Screen \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S. specific iPhone deals are hard to come by apart from carrier offers for new signups and trade-ins. We recommend checking <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/wireless-devices/smartphones/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.att.com/buy/phones/browse/apple/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones/brand/apple\" target=\"_blank\">T-Mobile’s</a> sites if you’re looking to change carriers or add a new line. Apple also offers <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13-pro\" target=\"_blank\">trade-ins and carrier deals</a> through its website. We also recommend that you look at our round-up of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1066992/iphone-14-and-iphone-14-pro-best-carrier-and-store-deals.html\">iPhone 14 deals</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2073364/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-best-deals-carriers-stores-online.html\">iPhone 15 deals for U.S. readers</a>, and with the arrival of the iPhone 16 we will be tracking <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2455678/iphone-16-plus-pro-and-pro-max-where-to-get-the-best-deals-in-the-u-s.html\">Where to get the best </a><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2455678/iphone-16-plus-pro-and-pro-max-where-to-get-the-best-deals-in-the-u-s.html\">iPhone 16, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max</a> deals in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K., we frequently see Apple-certified resellers discount unlocked iPhones.

Prices stayed the same, but the new base model now starts with 16GB of RAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Air, while still running on the M3 chip had a Unified Memory update in October 2024 and now ships with 16GB RAM as standard. Beware that some deals on the older models may be as good now that you can get double the memory for the same price and if you are outside the U.S. note that the prices of the new models are now lower than the old models were at launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHWM5FB\">M4, 14-inch MacBook Pro, 512GB/16GB RAM</a>:

Also note that if you are outside the U.S. prices on the new M4 Mac mini and M4 iMac are lower than they were, so the discounts may not be as good as they look when compared to the new models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBTPDCS/\">M4 Mac mini, 16GB RAM, 256GB</a>: $579 ($40 off, MSRP $599)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBX4B1K\">M4 Mac mini, 16GB RAM, 512GB</a>: $749 ($50, MSRP $799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-Desktop-Computer-8-core/dp/B0DL75531G/\">M4 iMac, 8-core GPU, 256GB/16GB RAM</a>: $1,194 ($105 off, MSRP $1,299)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL71DPKQ\" target=\"_blank\">M4 iMac, 10-Core GPU, 256GB/16GB RAM</a>, $1,349 ($150 off, MSRP $1,499)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL71DPKQ\" target=\"_blank\">M4 iMac, 10-Core GPU, 512GB/16GB RAM</a>, $1,554 ($145 off, MSRP $1,699)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Best Buy, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-mac-mini-desktop-m2-pro-chip-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-silver/6200726.p\" target=\"_blank\">M2 Pro Mac mini, 16GB RAM, 512GB</a>: $899 ($400 off, MSRP was $1,299 – <strong>Clearance</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>John Lewis: <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/2024-apple-mac-mini-desktop-computer-m4-processor-16gb-ram-256gb-silver/p112837956\" target=\"_blank\">M4 Mac mini, 256GB/16GB RAM</a>, £568.99 (£30 off, RRP £599)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>John Lewis: <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/2024-apple-mac-mini-desktop-computer-m4-processor-16gb-ram-512gb-silver/p112837957\" target=\"_blank\">M4 Mac mini, 256GB/16GB RAM</a>, £759.99 (£40 off, RRP £799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DLC7G8BN\" target=\"_blank\">M4 Pro Mac mini, 512GB/24GB RAM</a>, £1,285 (£114 off, RRP £1,399)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DL6JM9X1\" target=\"_blank\">M4 iMac, 8-core GPU, 256GB/16GB RAM</a>, £1,179.97 (£119 off, RRP £1,299)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DL74RCYL\" target=\"_blank\">M4 iMac, 10-Core GPU, 256GB/16GB RAM</a>, £1,349.97 (£149 off, RRP £1,499)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AO.com: <a href=\"https://ao.com/product/mwv03ba-apple-imac-desktop-green-103978-253.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">M4 iMac, 10-Core GPU, 256GB/16GB RAM</a>, £1,535 (£164 off, RRP £1,699)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BSHG6CG6\" target=\"_blank\">M2 Pro Mac mini, 512GB/16GB RAM</a>: £1,199 (£200 off, RRP was £1,399 – <strong>Clearance</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For more Mac deals check out our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678533/mac-studio-deals.html\">best Mac Studio deals</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673695/best-mac-mini-deals.html\">best Mac mini deals</a>, plus our dedicated round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672803/best-imac-deals.html\">best iMac deals</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"bbc1722a852846d91c04585effd43ddb01acd39f4cabe2fc80b9d010e4cf85dd","category":"Apple"}
