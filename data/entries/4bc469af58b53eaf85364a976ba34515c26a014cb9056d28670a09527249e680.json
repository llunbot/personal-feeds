The event, which comprised a three-day Women’s WorldTour race, as well as 100, 60 and 30-mile mass rides plus a central London ‘FreeCycle’ will go on ‘a hiatus’ next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LME notes full refunds will be offered and it will undergo a ‘full strategic review’ of the event, which began as a legacy event from the 2012 London <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics</a>, taking riders on the Olympic Road Race route over Box Hill in Surrey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hugh Brasher, LME CEO, said, ‘We feel the time is right to take a pause this year and bring all stakeholders together to work on a new concept for the world’s greatest festival of cycling.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>London’s Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said, ‘It’s disappointing news that RideLondon won’t be taking place next year; it’s a fantastic event to celebrate cycling that brings together cyclists of all levels, from beginners to professional athletes. I am committed to working with all partners to bring back this hugely popular event in the future.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes a few months after news that the RideLondon Classique pro race was cancelled for 2025 after the UCI had pushed it back a week on the calendar to 30th May-1st June. LME said it was not feasible to host the event on these dates and that there was ‘no prior warning’ about the move. The last edition of the Classique earlier this year was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-classique-gallery-2024\" target=\"_blank\">dominated by Lorena Wiebes</a> of SD Worx-Protime, who won all three stages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>RideLondon had been held annually apart from the Covid-induced cancellations in 2020 and 2021. It returned for 2022 after moving from Surrey to Essex and held its tenth edition in May this year.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-review\">Tour of Britain 2024 review: Williams rewarded, Magnier graduates and Remco’s 24-carat bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-classique-gallery-2024\">RideLondon Classique gallery: Wiebes’ World, party time, excellent</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ridelondon-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 105: RideLondon Special, with race director Kevin Nash</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-organise\">Taking over London: Behind the scenes at RideLondon</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ridelondon-cancelled-2025\">RideLondon cancelled for 2025 with plans to work on ‘a new concept’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4bc469af58b53eaf85364a976ba34515c26a014cb9056d28670a09527249e680","category":"Cycling"}
