The headphones have not received any hardware upgrades since, leading some customers to hold off on their purchase and hope that Apple will eventually release AirPods Max 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnfortunately, rumors suggest that AirPods Max 2 are not coming any time soon, with only minor revisions expected for the headphones later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously reported that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-late-2024/\">planning to update the AirPods Max in late 2024</a> with a USB-C charging port, instead of the current Lightning port, and he said new color options are also a possibility for the headphones. Beyond that, Gurman said Apple is planning <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1762690933659988326\">no other changes</a> for the revised AirPods Max, to the point that he expects the updated headphones to still be considered first-generation AirPods Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the information shared by Gurman is accurate, that means the AirPods Max would not be updated with the H2 chip that debuted in the second-generation AirPods Pro a few years ago. As a result, the AirPods Max would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/airpods-max-2-could-miss-out-on-adaptive-audio/\">miss out on Adaptive Audio features</a>, along with longer battery life afforded by the H2 chip's increased power efficiency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the event Apple ever does release AirPods Max 2, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/airpods-max-2-launch-next-year-what-to-expect/\">plausible upgrades</a> include the H2 chip, longer battery life, improved active noise cancellation, a U2 chip with support for Precision Finding in the Find My app, Bluetooth 5.3, and a redesigned carrying case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said the AirPods Max would be updated in late 2024, but it is unclear exactly when. Apple recently announced that it will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/\">holding a media event on September 9</a>, where it is expected to unveil <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/gurman-airpods-4-this-year/\">fourth-generation AirPods</a> alongside new iPhones and Apple Watches, but it is unclear if the revised AirPods Max will also be introduced then.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAirPods Max are regularly $549 in the U.S., but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/airpods-max-hit-399/\">Amazon has the headphones on sale for $399</a> in all color options, including Green, Pink, Silver, Sky Blue, and Space Gray.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-max-2-rumor-recap/\">AirPods Max 2: What Rumors Say Ahead of the Apple Event Next Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-2-what-rumors-say-ahead-of-the-apple-event-next-month.2434521/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"03085242001b2954ad114285d97a843aff5ee62c21f740ad211fb7b9b7190ab3","category":"Apple"}
