Today, Google is releasing a raft of improvements for the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/\">Gemini 2.0 models</a>, and as part of that upgrade, some of the AI's most advanced features are now available to free users. You'll be able to use the improved Deep Research to get in-depth information on a topic, and Google's newest reasoning model can peruse your search history to improve its understanding of you as a person. What could go wrong?</p>\n<p>Like most big AI players, Google has a number of different models available. Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is the company's most capable <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/\">multistep reasoning model</a>, which can consider complex topics and gives you a window into its \"thought\" process. Google is adding a lot to this model in its latest round of updates, enabling a much larger 1-million-token context window, file uploads, and faster output. It also supports more Google apps with connections to Calendar, Notes, Tasks, and Photos.</p>\n<p>With the aim of making Gemini more personal to you, Google is also plugging Flash Thinking Experimental into a new source of data: your search history. <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-personalization/\">Google stresses</a> that you have to opt in to this feature, and it can be disabled at any time. Gemini will even display a banner to remind you it's connected to your search history so you don't forget. If you grant access, the AI can allegedly understand you better and offer more relevant recommendations. It feels a bit strange to turn Gemini loose on such personal data, but Google already knows what you look up on the Internet. You're not giving up much more if you let the robot have a peek. This is apparently just the start of Google's efforts to personalize the AI.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-gemini-ai-can-now-see-your-search-history/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-gemini-ai-can-now-see-your-search-history/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f63a05bbe6f8666587504a542e95fea19d175a84b5b117f7936febe5fed6c365","category":"Tech"}
