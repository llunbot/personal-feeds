You’ll also find something new in the box—a modern charging cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple introduced a braided USB-C charging cable with the iPad Pro in 2022, so the mini, which was updated in late 2021, missed out. And since it hadn’t received a refresh until this week, it was the only iPad that still had the old cable that’s not as nice nor as durable. With the new mini, Apple has fixed that issue and now provides a woven cable in the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQKJ3AM/A/60w-usb-c-charge-cable-1-m\">sells</a> the 1m cable for $19, which supports charging up to 60 watts and transfers data at USB 2 rates (480Mbps). The iPad mini’s USB 3 Gen 2 port can transfer data at speeds up to 10Gbps for the first time, so if you want to take advantage of the faster transfers, you’ll need a different cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you’re in Europe, you won’t get a charger in the box. Apple previously removed the charger from the iPad Air and Pro boxes when they arrived in May and this week removed the charger from the 10th-gen iPad’s box. That’s likely in response to a wave of EU regulations targeting electronic waste. Apple still supplies a 20W charger for iPads sold in the U.S. and other regions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini\">available for preorder now</a> and will arrive on shelves on Wednesday, October 23.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple iPad mini (7th Gen, 2024, A17 Pro, 128GB)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"3840\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple iPad mini (7th Gen, 2024, A17 Pro, 128GB)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3840w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPad-mini-7.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$499 (128GB); $599 (256GB); $799 (512GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini\" target=\"_blank\">$499 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"153176a66a1a33319e3233a2dd3b62340ff5bef2947104afea5c5a05721f16fb","category":"Apple"}
