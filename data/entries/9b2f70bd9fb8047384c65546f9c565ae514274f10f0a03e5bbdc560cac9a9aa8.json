{"title":"Apple's 'My Photo Stream' Service Shutting Down in July 2023","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/my-photo-stream-july-2023-shutdown/","date":1685127106000,"content":"Apple's \"My Photo Stream\" service is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210705\">set to shut down</a> on July 26, 2023, which means customers who are still using that feature will need to transition to using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/\">iCloud Photos</a> prior to that date.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg\" alt width=\"836\" height=\"470\" />\r<br />\nMy Photo Stream is a free service that uploads the last 30 days of images (up to 1,000) to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, making them accessible on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, iPod touch, Mac, and PC. It predates ‌iCloud Photos‌ and has largely been replaced by the ‌iCloud Photos‌ service at this point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoing forward, Apple plans to have all customers use ‌iCloud Photos‌ instead of My Photo Stream. New photo uploads to My Photo Stream will stop on June 26, 2023, and images will remain in ‌iCloud‌ as usual for 30 days until the shutdown point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause all of the images in My Photo Stream are stored in their original format on at least one Apple device, there isn't a danger of photos being lost as part of the shutdown process. Apple recommends that users who want to have their images on a particular device save them to the Photo Library on that device prior to July 26.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/macos-mojave-photos-my-photo-stream.jpg\" alt width=\"1560\" height=\"864\" />\r<br />\nImages in My Photo Stream can be saved to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app on the ‌iPhone‌ by opening up ‌Photos‌, going to the My Photo Stream album, selecting individual photos, and using the Share button to save them to the Library. The process is the same on the Mac, but you will need to drag images from My Photo Stream to the Library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple suggests that ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, and Mac users turn on ‌iCloud Photos‌ to view their photos and videos across their devices. ‌iCloud Photos‌ is available on iPhones and iPads running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-8-3/\">iOS 8.3</a> or later and Macs running OS X Yosemite or later.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/my-photo-stream-july-2023-shutdown/\">Apple's 'My Photo Stream' Service Shutting Down in July 2023</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-my-photo-stream-service-shutting-down-in-july-2023.2390611/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b2f70bd9fb8047384c65546f9c565ae514274f10f0a03e5bbdc560cac9a9aa8","category":"Apple"}
