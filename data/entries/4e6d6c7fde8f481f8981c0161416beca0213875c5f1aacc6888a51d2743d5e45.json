Apple said the 3D maps would be rolled out to additional cities later this year, including Philadelphia, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., and Apple previewed the feature in Washington, D.C. today in honor of Veterans Day.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is honoring Veterans Day with special content in the App Store, Apple Books app, Apple TV app, and more. There is also a Veterans Day-themed Activity Challenge that Apple Watch users in the U.S. can complete by recording any workout for 11 minutes or longer today with the Workout app or any app that adds workouts to the Health app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/veterans-day-2021-activity-challenge.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple CEO Tim Cook today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1458820905031798784\">tweeted</a> that he is \"grateful today and always for the dedication and service of our veterans and their families, and the invaluable experience they bring long after they have left the military, including here at Apple.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update Nov 12 10:00 a.m.</b>: The new 3D map experience is live not only in Washington, D.C., but also in San Diego.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/activity-challenge/\">Activity Challenge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/veterans-day/\">Veterans Day</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/11/apple-maps-3d-washington-dc/\">Apple Rolls Out 3D Maps With Custom-Designed Landmarks in Washington, D.C. and San Diego [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rolls-out-3d-maps-with-custom-designed-landmarks-in-washington-d-c-and-san-diego-updated.2322938/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mrRPSHHRR80:6ooqCLmBaxI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mrRPSHHRR80:6ooqCLmBaxI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e6d6c7fde8f481f8981c0161416beca0213875c5f1aacc6888a51d2743d5e45","category":"Apple"}
