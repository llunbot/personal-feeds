Some weeks, they stand out, like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-aston-martin-vantage-great-but-frustrating/\">bright green Aston Martin</a>, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-bentley-continental-gt-the-highs-and-lows-of-borrowed-bits/\">murdered-out Bentley</a>, or the VW ID. Buzz you can read about soon; these cars usually spark conversations with neighbors, particularly those who don't know why there's a different vehicle in that spot each week.</p>\n<p>At other times, the vehicles are more anonymous, and I'm not sure this ADX sparked any community discussions. Compact crossovers are a popular breed and blend into the background. Particularly when they're painted an unobtrusive shade.</p>\n<p>Which is not to say the ADX is not handsome; the Urban Gray Pearl paint looked good even in the near-constant rain (which explains the Acura-supplied images rather than my own) that coincided with our time with the tester. And from the driver's seat, the view down the hood, along those creases, is a lot more interesting than most comparable crossovers, considering the ADX's $35,000 starting price.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/2025-acura-adx-review-a-crossover-that-balances-budget-with-vigor/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/2025-acura-adx-review-a-crossover-that-balances-budget-with-vigor/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
