It comes in three finishes: the classic Natural Aluminium plus two nature-inspired additions – Honey Tone and Eucalyptus Green.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonic upgrades include what B&amp;O claims is the largest woofer in its class, delivering deeper bass with a Bass SPL of 64dB – 2dB more than the previous model. Battery life has been extended to 24 hours, and the speaker retains Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity with Microsoft Swift Pair and Google Fast Pair support. The speaker also now comes with support for the aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe A1 3rd Gen carries an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, so you can take it into the shower or to the beach. It also has a three-microphone array for using it as a speakerphone for calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/beoplay-a1-3rd-gen-colors.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" />\r<br />\nThe A1 features modular architecture designed for a 10-year lifetime and is the first Bluetooth speaker to receive Cradle to Cradle certification (Bronze level).
