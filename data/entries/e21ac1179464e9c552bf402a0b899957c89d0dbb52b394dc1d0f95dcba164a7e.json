They’re also extremely light, with complete wheelsets weighing as little as 965g! Available in two versions and three depths, there’s a model for every type of road rider, as long as you can afford them. Here’s what you need to know…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scope’s Scale Pattern Rims</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"458\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels-800x458.jpg\" alt=\"scope artech wheels on a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels-800x458.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels-297x170.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels-120x69.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels-768x439.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Tubeless-aero-road-bike-wheels-2048x1172.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scope’s new Artech rims have a fish scale-like texture with different-sized scales based on location. Larger scales at the outside where the air is moving faster, then they get smaller as you get closer to the hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design doesn’t just create a boundary layer like dimples, it actually smoothes the airflow across the entire rim surface for less drag <em>and</em> stabilizes the wheel for steadier handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-aeroscale-crosswind-drag-comparison.jpg\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-aeroscale-crosswind-drag-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"scope artech drag comparison chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-aeroscale-crosswind-drag-comparison.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-aeroscale-crosswind-drag-comparison-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-aeroscale-crosswind-drag-comparison-800x360.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-aeroscale-crosswind-drag-comparison-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-aeroscale-crosswind-drag-comparison-768x346.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The chart above shows a drag comparison with their 65mm versions of the Aeroscale rim versus the same rim profile without the scales. There’s a huge decrease in drag at 10º yaw angle (aka “crosswind”) with the Aeroscales. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"scope artech rim depth comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-297x69.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-800x187.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-120x28.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-768x179.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-1536x358.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-scaled-carbon-rims-closeup-depth-comparison-2048x478.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rim profiles are also algorithmically optimized for aerodynamics, with three different rim depths to choose from – 22mm, 45mm, and 65mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"scope artech aero scales road bike wheels with bladed carbon spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-Aerolite-Carbon-Spoke-closeup-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rims save weight by using locally reinforced layups around the spoke holes, not the entire spoke bed. Wheels are laced up with Carbonlite AeroSpokes, which are not only very light, they’re extremely strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spokes’ blade profile measures 1mm thick by 4mm wide. They use 18 on the front wheel, 24 in the rear. Scope says the spokes have a 500kg pull force, which is higher than metal spokes, and build a wheel that’s incredibly laterally stiff.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Artech 3D-printed hubs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1857\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"scope artech 3d printed hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-297x215.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-800x580.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-120x87.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-768x557.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-1536x1114.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-1-2048x1485.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Artech hub design is inspired by the lattice structure of bone, which is has an incredible strength to weight ratio. By using “topology optimization” to place material only where needed, they ended up with a unique design…and a hubset that weighs just 205g! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3.jpg\" alt=\"3d printing bicycle hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hub shells are 3D printed from Scalmalloy, a lightweight scandium alloy. It’s comparable in strength to 7000-series aluminum, but can be used in additive manufacturing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each hub shell takes four days to print, but they make them 25 at a time. They’re then machined to the necessary tolerances and giving a PVD coating.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2.jpg\" alt=\"scope artech 3d printed hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scope-Artech-3D-printed-hubs-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They use a 7075 freehub body with excess material machined away. Inside is their Diamond Ratchet SL engagement system, which uses titanium ratchets coated with a diamond-like surface treatment. The materials and design are based on F1 gearboxes to be strong enough to handle the torque while also being lighter than steel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diamond Ratchet SL internals can also be swapped into their Race series hubs, which use a traditional alloy hub shell. The freehub body will be available in Shimano HG &amp; Micro Spline, Campagnolo  and N3W, and SRAM XDR options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scope Artech Aeroscale wheel pricing &amp; options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1319\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"road and all road comparison of scope artech wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-297x153.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-800x412.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-120x62.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-768x396.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-1536x792.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/scope-artech-6-road-vs-allroad-wheels-2048x1055.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Road version on the left, All Road on the right. Can you spot the difference?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Artech wheels come in two versions – Road, and All Road. Both come in three depths – 22mm, 45mm, and 65mm. All of them use a hooked bead with full tubeless compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Road series rims have a 23mm internal rim width, and the All-Road series rims have a 25mm internal width, letting you run wider tires for rougher roads or fast gravel on smooth dirt roads. Other than that, they’re identical, sharing the same Carbonlite Aero spokes and Artech hubs. Claimed weights are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Road:</strong> \n<ul>\n<li>965g (A2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1150g (A4)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1244g (A6)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>All-Road:</strong> \n<ul>\n<li>990g (A2.A)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1200g (A4.A)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1319g (A6.A)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is €3.998 ($4.398 / £3.498), available in April 2024. Upgrade to CeramicSpeed ceramic bearings for an additional €500. Gravel and triathlon versions are coming later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.scopecycling.com/artech/\" target=\"_blank\">ScopeCycling.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/scope-artech-aeroscale-wheels/\">Scope Artech Aeroscale Slip by w/ Textured Rims &amp; 3D-Printed Hubs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e21ac1179464e9c552bf402a0b899957c89d0dbb52b394dc1d0f95dcba164a7e","category":"Cycling"}
