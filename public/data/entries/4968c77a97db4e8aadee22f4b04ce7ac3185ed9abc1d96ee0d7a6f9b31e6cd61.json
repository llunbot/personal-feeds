Continental says it has added a boosted tread pattern, sturdier multi-layer ply construction and more resistant sidewalls.</p>\n<p>Like the GP5000 S TR, the AS TR and the TT TR tyres share a 110 TPI (threads-per-inch) casing. The AS TR has four layers of ply construction, compared to the S TR’s three, according to Continental.</p>\n<p>Continental product manager Alexander Hänke says the AS TR has a thicker tread than the GP5000 S TR, which should make it last longer than the lighter tyre.</p>\n<p>Available in 25mm to 35mm widths, the GP5000 AS TR is tubeless-ready and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">compatible with hookless rims</a>.</p>\n<p>All sizes come with cream or black sidewalls, but ‘transparent’ <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tan-wall-tyres-hot-or-not/\">tan sidewalls </a>aren’t in the mix.</p>\n<p>The black version uses Black-Reflex technology – an incognito reflective band – to increase the rider’s visibility in the dark without showing up in daylight.</p>\n<p>Continental says a 700 x 25c AS TR tyre weighs 300g, but our 28c samples tip the scales at 340g for the black-sidewalled version and 342g for the cream variety.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Claimed weight per tyre</strong>: 300g (700 x 25c)</li>\n<li><strong>Actual weight per tyre</strong>: 340g (700 x 28c, black), 342g (700 x 28c, cream)</li>\n<li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 700 x 25, 28, 32, 35c</li>\n<li><strong>TPI</strong>: 110</li>\n<li><strong>Colours</strong>: Black with cream sidewall, black with reflective black sidewalls</li>\n<li><strong>Technology</strong>: Black Chili compound, Vectran Breaker, LazerGrip, Active Comfort Technology, Black-Reflex (black sidewall only)</li>\n<li><strong>Price per tyre</strong>: €95.99</li>\n</ul><h2>Continental GP5000 TT TR spec and pricing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The TT TR uses the fewest layers of ply of all the range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Continental </i></span></div>\n<p>Continental says it has made the GP 5000 TT TR tyre fast, supple and light, with the 110 TPI casing married to a two-ply construction (remember, the benchmark S TR has three plys).</p>\n<p>The TT TR is claimed to be 35g lighter than the S TR, at 220g per tyre in a 700 x 25c size.
