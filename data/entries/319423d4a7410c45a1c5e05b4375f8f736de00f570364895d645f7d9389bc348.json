Seven reasons, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second iOS 18.4 beta unveiled seven new emoji that were part of version 16 of the Unicode Consortiumâ€™s emoji list. They include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Face with bags under eyes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fingerprint</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leafless tree</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Root vegetable (basically a beet, although turnip is included in the searchable keywords)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Harp</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shovel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Splatter</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The list, which also includes the flag for the island of Sark, off the coast of France, was finalized in September. The emoji will be available in iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS 15.4. The otherwise minor update will likely land in mid- to late March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Unicode Consortium has already approved emojis for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2523047/we-already-know-the-new-emojis-coming-to-the-iphone-in-ios-19.html\">version 17</a>, which could see a release later this year in iOS 19: Distorted face, cartoon fight cloud, ballet dancer, apple core, killer whale, big foot, trombone, landslide, and treasure chest.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"319423d4a7410c45a1c5e05b4375f8f736de00f570364895d645f7d9389bc348","category":"Apple"}
