But while they may be friendly on the environment, the reception of the new bands has been quite unpleasant, with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2311124/apple-kills-off-finewoven-report.html\">a new report</a> claiming Apple has ditched the material altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while Apple doesn’t sell leather bands anymore, Amazon’s Woot is running a sale on the remaining stock of old ones. Today you can get the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-band-leather-link&amp;xcust=1-1-2311368-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Leather Link Apple Watch band in Ink (dark blue) or Midnight (black) for just $40</a>, a savings of $60 on the original MSRP. The bands available fit all sizes of Apple Watch (38/40/41/42/44/45mm), although Midnight was not available in 42/44/45mm as of this writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple describes the Leather Link as using Venezia leather handcrafted in Arzignano, Italy. A “delicate milling and tumbling process enhances the beautiful pebbled texture,” and a magnetic clasp ensures a firm fit. It comes with a one-year warranty from Apple, which is rare for a Woot sale, and Amazon Prime members get free shipping. The deal will remain until Wednesday, April 29 or until it’s sold out.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e71e92ecb70ddcf39b4b673e73ea5355dcfea62a430bd7d541b322f7423d3e00","category":"Apple"}
