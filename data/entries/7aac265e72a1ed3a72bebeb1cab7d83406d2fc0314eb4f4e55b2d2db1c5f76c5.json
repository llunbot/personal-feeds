Most of these new health monitoring functions are not expected to arrive before 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is said to be considering adding a thermometer to the Apple Watch for health monitoring purposes as soon as next year. The thermometer's features are purportedly based around fertility planning and improved detection of patterns when tracking sleep.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe blood-pressure monitoring feature reportedly detects when pressure is increasing and can suggest the presence of hypertension. Apple intended to release the feature next year but has experienced difficulties in perfecting the technology, according to the report.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs opposed to the common methods that measure blood pressure using an inflatable cuff wrapped around the upper arm, Apple's system measures the speed of the wave of a heartbeat through a user's arteries using sensors. This would then show users how their blood pressure is trending, but would not provide a baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurement. Some Apple employees have apparently raised questions with managers over the usefulness of the feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFurther in the future, the company apparently has plans to implement detection for sleep apnea and diabetes, as well as provide medical guidance when it detects low blood-oxygen levels.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe report cautioned that these features are currently under study and may never be released to customers or could be delayed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">wsj.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/multiple-new-apple-watch-health-features/\">Apple Reportedly Planning Multiple New Apple Watch Health Features, Including Temperature and Blood-Pressure Monitoring</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-planning-multiple-new-apple-watch-health-features-including-temperature-and-blood-pressure-monitoring.2309419/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Pa5MX9Au4B0:PeGR9O4kvbU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Pa5MX9Au4B0:PeGR9O4kvbU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Pa5MX9Au4B0\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7aac265e72a1ed3a72bebeb1cab7d83406d2fc0314eb4f4e55b2d2db1c5f76c5","category":"Apple"}
