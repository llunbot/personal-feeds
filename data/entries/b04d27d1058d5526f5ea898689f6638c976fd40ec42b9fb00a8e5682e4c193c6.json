{"title":"WSJ: Visa Offers Apple Roughly $100 Million to Switch Apple Card’s Network From Mastercard","link":"https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-card-visa-mastercard-deal-3ce762da","date":1743722138000,"content":"\n<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AMIc70z-kQ4-ghz686tbG3Q\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Apple card is up for grabs because Goldman Sachs, the bank\nbehind it, is getting out of the consumer lending world. For\nmonths, big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial\nhave been vying to take over as issuer. What hasn’t been known is\nthe equally fierce fight playing out between the networks to win\nApple, with Visa and American Express trying to unseat Mastercard,\naccording to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Apple is expected to select a network for the card before it picks\nthe bank to replace Goldman Sachs. Networks provide the plumbing\nthat transmit information between the banks that issue consumers’\ncards and the merchants’ banks.</p>\n\n<p>Visa, the largest network, has made an aggressive pitch to win the\ncard, including offering the kind of upfront payment to Apple\nthat’s normally reserved for the biggest card programs, the people\nsaid. Visa offered a similar payment when Costco was selecting its\nnetwork about a decade ago, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>\n\n<p>American Express is also in the mix, trying to become both the\nissuer and network of the Apple card, the people said. Goldman had\napproached Amex to gauge its interest in taking over the card in\n2023, the Journal earlier reported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve always thought Visa and Mastercard were interchangeable. I can’t recall ever once in my life seeing an establishment where one of them was accepted but the other wasn’t, and they both seem to be accepted everywhere that accepts credit cards at all. If there’s a reason to prefer one over the other I’ve never heard it.</p>\n\n<p>Amex is different because it’s accepted at fewer locations because they charge merchants a higher fee, which they get away with because they offer their customers superior service. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses\">I wrote back in 2023</a> that they share an affinity with Apple: both are built around the idea of offering a premium experience and charging higher prices for it.</p>\n\n<p>But I already have a regular Amex card. One of the things I like about Apple Card being a Mastercard (or if they switched to Visa) is that it’s a card I can use anywhere that doesn’t accept Amex.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b04d27d1058d5526f5ea898689f6638c976fd40ec42b9fb00a8e5682e4c193c6","category":"Tech"}
