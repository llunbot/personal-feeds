The error message said to contact a computer or network administrator for assistance, or indicated that the Mac failed to open a connection to the device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers may have encountered the error in the Image Capture app, Preview app, or the Printers &amp; Scanners section of System Preferences, according to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor users who elect not to update to macOS 11.6 at this time, Apple previously shared step-by-step instructions on how to temporarily resolve the issue:<ol><li>Quit any apps that are open.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>From the menu bar in the Finder, choose Go &gt; Go to Folder.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Type <strong>/Library/Image Capture/Devices</strong>, then press Return.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>In the window that opens, double-click the app named in the error message. It's the name of your scanner driver. Nothing should happen when you open it.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Close the window and open the app you were using to scan. A new scan should proceed normally. If you later choose to scan from a different app and get the same error, repeat these steps.</li></ol>The issue has presumably also been fixed in the latest macOS Monterey beta.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-big-sur.226\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-fixes-mac-scanner-permission-error/\">Apple Says Scanner Permission Error Fixed in macOS 11.6</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-scanner-permission-error-fixed-in-macos-11-6.2312955/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C9AMDbz2Udc:W0HhUdZDLOo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C9AMDbz2Udc:W0HhUdZDLOo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/C9AMDbz2Udc\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"987f573332f19ed44f4584cd39d3499586529588022b26339efbe8fc7fe41dd8","category":"Apple"}
