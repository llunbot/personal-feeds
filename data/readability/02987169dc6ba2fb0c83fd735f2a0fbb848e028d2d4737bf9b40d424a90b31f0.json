The new disc brake version has been a bit of an open secret since its limited racing debut early this season with Cofidis starting at the Tour of Romandie. But now De Rosa has unveiled the full TT03 Disk details, and that it will completely replace the outgoing rim brake version.</p><h2>De Rosa TT03 Disk disc brake only TT bike</h2><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sGSFzPPq1Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>In designing a new disc brake version to replace their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/05/04/giro101-tech-israel-cycling-academys-derosa-road-tt-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rim brake TT bike</a>, De Rosa improved on three performance characteristics of the previous carbon time trial bike: maximum aerodynamics, reduced weight, and greater stiffness.
