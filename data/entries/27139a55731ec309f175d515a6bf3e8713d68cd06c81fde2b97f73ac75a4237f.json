swapped this bike with Keith Haring in 1988 for our “Multi-fluoro” mountain bike, which was painted in these psychedelic colours, the aesthetic of the 1980s,’ says Antonio Colombo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The exchange was I give you a new one, you give me an old one painted. This was one of three bikes Henrik Oersted used for his Hour record attempt in 1986 [although the Dane pulled out at the last minute with a hand injury].’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haring, who died in 1990 aged 31, was an influential street artist in 1980s New York, famous for his colourful murals that often depicted the ‘dancing men’ that feature on this ‘funny bike’s’ disc wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People think I just gave Keith the wheels, but I sent him the whole bike. So I was surprised when it came back and the frame was the same colour. I asked him why he hadn’t painted it and he told me “because the paint was so good already”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The link between Cinelli and guys like Keith is not straight. These guys are not interested in what is going on at the Tour de France. But we have a connection with bike messengers and the fixed gear scene that came out of it. Those guys needed low maintenance, fast and light bikes they could carry up stairs, so they ended up with track bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As a messenger you spend your life on a bicycle, so they wanted the best they could afford, so they bought old Bianchi, Cinelli, Masi frames. Everything that makes you feel better goes faster.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Laser Stayer, c.1989</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234945/cinelli_classic_bikes_05_0.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This bicycle was at the World Championships, where it won gold,’ says Cinelli’s CEO, Paolo Erzegovesi. Walter Brugna was the rider [the year was 1990]. Not long after [in 1994] the UCI stopped stayer racing.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stayer racing is the most madcap cycling discipline, in which riders are motor-paced around a velodrome with the moto rider standing up to act as a windbreak and the cyclist riding as close as possible behind. Stayer bikes have 24-inch front wheels, ‘reversed’ forks and exceptionally long stems to get the rider deep into the slipstream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The G-force on a stayer when it corners is incredible, so the bikes had braces under the stem and seat to keep them stiff – we used to sell many of these braces – and the riders would wrap the bars with big foam pads to protect their hands from the pain of holding on. They would average 70-80kmh per hour, and could reach 100kmh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘To get as far forward behind the motor-pacer as possible, the seat tube was very steep, but that meant the saddle nose passed the bottom bracket, which was against the rules. So all the saddles had their noses cut off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The rear wheel was brought in as far as possible too, sometimes so much so that a channel had to be cut into the bottom bracket shell, and the wheel could only be removed when the tyre was deflated.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cinelli SC, c.1968</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/04234951/cinelli_classic_bikes_06_0.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Super Corsa. It is Columbus SL tubing with the seatpost binder with the hole in the back,’ says Erzegovesi. ‘It has the [Alfredo] Binda toe straps, but the all-leather ones.

He reasoned that the smoother roads no longer needed forks with long, heavily raked legs designed to flex.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"803\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0-970x803.jpg\" alt=\"cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0-970x803.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0-300x248.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0-768x636.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0-1536x1272.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0-750x621.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0-1140x944.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175933/cinelli_classic_bikes_15_0.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus the sloping fork crown – a ubiquitous sight on most of today’s road bikes – was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That design was our invention, and it meant the fork could have shorter and therefore stiffer legs, which is exactly what you need on the track. Another thing you need to be able to do is fine-tune the rider position, which is why the seat clamp here is also very special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Cino wanted to clamp the seatpost without applying too much torque on the bolt, so the seatstay lugs are positioned behind the seatpost [not either side, as was more common] and are shaped and cut so the seat bolt goes right up against the back of the seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It meant the bolt required much less torque to secure the post than the old designs, where the bolt would fail after maybe 20 uses. This meant we could change Ritter’s position many times without having to keep replacing the seat bolt.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CMX-1, 1980</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175937/cinelli_classic_bikes_17_0.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Cino Cinelli’s son, Andrea, used to work for the company back when I joined in the 1970s, although he left sometime in the 1980s to start his own company, Cinetica [making some of the earliest monocoque carbon fibre frames],’ says Erzegovesi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘One day Andrea saw Andrea Pesenti welding some of our industrial tubing with a TIG torch – this was when everything was still brazed – and he said, “Hey, do you want to try and make a bike like this?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘So this was the first TIG-welded bike we produced in big numbers.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-970x964.jpg\" alt=\"cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-970x964.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-300x298.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-768x763.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-750x745.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0-1140x1133.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/02175942/cinelli_classic_bikes_16_0.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As the company did with mountain bikes in the mid-1980s (Antonio Colombo relates the story that ‘I went to a Grateful Dead concert with Gary Fisher, then I went to see him working in his garage outside San Francisco and thought, “This is the future of the bicycle.”’), Cinelli had foreseen the United States’ BMX boom coming to Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It set about creating what might be the only mass-produced, Columbus-tubed BMX the world has ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It matched the frame with its own stem and seatpost (the latter interestingly marketed as ‘hollow at both ends for light weight but solid in the centre for additional strength at the insertion point’), specially commissioned hubs, chainset and pedals from Campagnolo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And showing its true racing pedigree, the original spec sheet ran to 20-inch tubular tyres from Clement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was somewhat successful for the company.
