{"title":"I never regretted buying an Apple device–until now","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2407699/homepod-mini-sound-siri-apple-intelligence-connectivity-issues.html","date":1721989800000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>I have almost no regrets when it comes to Apple products. Whenever Apple introduces a new device, I can count on it being a sophisticated product even if it’s not immediately obvious. For example, despite my initial misgivings, I realized how ingenious and well-thought-out the AirPods are after using them daily. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why I had high expectations for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234895/homepod-mini-review.html\">HomePod mini</a>–maybe too high. Since I bought the stylish little speaker, I haven’t found it inspiring and now it just sits around uselessly. The problem with the HomePod mini is that Apple made too many compromises and instead of taking initiative, the product simply follows the trend of smart home speakers. While the HomePod mini works as it should, I have a better alternative for every task it can perform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an adage that says, “Better is the enemy of the good.” That’s the case with the HomePod mini: AirPods Pro sound better, Siri on my iPhone is faster, and it’s much easier to manage my life on my Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sounding off</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest problem I have with the HomePod mini is the sound quality. There’s nothing wrong with it, but OK is just not good enough for a $100 speaker. When I listen to my favorite songs music with it, I always have the impression that the quality is lacking. Of course, I don’t expect an affordable speaker to compete with the large HomePod–but even an ancient JBL Bluetooth speaker beats it in terms of volume and bass. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"HomePod mini\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1749w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The HomePod mini isn’t expensive—but it’s also not worth its $99 price tag.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"HomePod mini\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1749w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The HomePod mini isn’t expensive—but it’s also not worth its $99 price tag.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ben Patterson/Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"HomePod mini\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1749w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-homepod-mini-top-100868286-orig.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The HomePod mini isn’t expensive—but it’s also not worth its $99 price tag.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ben Patterson/Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Ben Patterson/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I admit, I don’t use the HomePod mini the way Apple intended. It’s ideal as a standalone device in a smaller room, perhaps the kitchen, playing music and podcasts. But I want to use it as a desktop speaker for the Mac mini and it’s just not strong enough to do the job for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using it with my Mac every day doesn’t work as smoothly as I want and there are constant annoyances. The latency when stopping or starting audio is annoying and if I want to use Siri on the iPhone, the HomePod gets in the way and tries to answer the question instead of the iPhone. Configuration via the Home app is also quite cumbersome. (I’m based in Germany, and part of the problem may be some compatibility issues with the <a href=\"https://en.avm.de/products/fritzbox/\">Fritz!Box</a> router that I use, but most of the issues seem to be fairly common.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, connecting my AirPods Pro to my Mac is so much easier. Thanks to Apple’s first-class integration with macOS, all I have to do is plug in the AirPods and they connect to the device I’m using, as if by magic. If I’m sitting in front of the Mac mini, the AirPods connect reliably to the computer. It works so easily and smoothly that I usually use my AirPods Pro instead of the HomePod mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oh, Siri</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri on the HomePod Mini is a disappointment–it’s like having an assistant with a split personality and hearing problems. I have no confidence in using Siri on the HomePod to add important appointments to my calendar. Granted, using Siri on the HomePod mini for standard tasks works perfectly. I can easily check the weather or call up a playlist by saying, “Play Taylor Swift.” But in the age of ChatGPT, that’s just not enough for me and I often miss the simple navigation interface of an iPod or the Music app.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"HomePod mini with Siri activated\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>Siri should be the best reason to buy a HomePod mini—but it’s just not good enough.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"HomePod mini with Siri activated\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Siri should be the best reason to buy a HomePod mini—but it’s just not good enough.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"HomePod mini with Siri activated\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HomePod-mini.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Siri should be the best reason to buy a HomePod mini—but it’s just not good enough.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> could be the solution, if it was compatible. However, since Apple has to install a more powerful CPU and 8GB of memory in every HomePod, that means the current HomePod mini will be left off the AI bandwagon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is reportedly working on a HomePod with a screen. However, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393340/a-screen-wont-fix-the-homepods-problems.html\" target=\"_blank\">as my colleague David Price points out,</a> this won’t solve most of the issues affecting the HomePod. If you use it as an audio device or as a Mac speaker, you usually don’t even have it in your field of vision–a display adds limited value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mini not mighty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All this being said, you can find customers who are completely satisfied with the HomPod mini. In the kitchen or dining room, it is a great alternative to a cheap speaker from Amazon or Google. But don’t expect too much from the small orb. It reminds me of those cool multifunctional devices that combine numerous tools such as a screwdriver, pliers, knife, and bottle opener. You think they’re brilliant at first, but when you really need them, you just end up getting your fingers caught.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d43aa693337a8cddec855f93e93b7bedf0ca2dcd44c67afd1eb6da0aa38e4d96","category":"Apple"}
