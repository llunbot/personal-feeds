Or, hustle and you can get the annual pass for $225 before March 1, 2026. Kid’s passes (ages 6-11) are just $200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pass works just like a multi-park ski pass. Buy it once and you get a full season of riding with TWO free day passes at all bike parks, plus 50% off a third day at most of them. Favorites like Kingdom Trails (VT), Angel Fire (NM), Windrock (TN), Ride Kanuga (NC), Jackson Hole (WY), Vailocity (CO), and lots more are included. Here’s a map:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1711\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"loam pass bike park map and regions for 2026 mountain bike season.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-scaled.jpg 1711w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-201x300.jpg 201w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-1536x2298.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-768x1149.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-1027x1536.jpg 1027w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/loam-pass-2026-bike-park-access-map-1369x2048.jpg 1369w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All regions are included, giving you more than 136 days of riding. Loam Pass passes are digital, saved on your phone, but you can add $20 for a physical pass add-on that comes with stickers and other treats…and is a nice back up in case there’s no cell service on the mountain (common) or your battery’s dead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://loampass.com\" target=\"_blank\">LoamPass.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/loam-pass-earlybird-season-pass-2026/\">Ride 70+ Bike Parks for $225 w/ Loam Pass Pre-Season Sale</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Staff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6595f932ad9683dd51ff5617e4b3acb0e9c3acab70a2194701a892919589754a","category":"Cycling"}
