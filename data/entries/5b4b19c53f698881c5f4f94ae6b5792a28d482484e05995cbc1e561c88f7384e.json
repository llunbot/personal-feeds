The EDC Mk2 now has an all-new, in-house developed front stainless steel rack, which has a max load of up to 50 kg. There are now three optional transmission systems, including a Pinion center gearbox, Rohloff rear hub, and a derailleur system, available when you order an EDC. Blacksnow also modified the stand-over height with a curved top tube. Finally, the rear wheel changed from 26″ to 27.5″, with a 2.4″ wide tire for more available market options and more sure-footed handling when the bike has a load.</p>\n<p>Blacksnow is distributed by <a href=\"https://www.merrysales.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Merry Sales</a> in the United States, so be sure to get your local bike shop to put in a request for one!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/blacksnow-cycles-edc-mk2-mini-cargo/\">Blacksnow Cycles EDC MK2 Mini Cargo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"5b4b19c53f698881c5f4f94ae6b5792a28d482484e05995cbc1e561c88f7384e","category":"Cycling"}
