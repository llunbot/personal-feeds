{"title":"Simon Willions’s Approach to Running a Link Blog","link":"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/","date":1735863904000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/02/willison-llms-2024\">Speaking of</a> Simon Willison, I great enjoyed this post from his week, with some of the self-imposed principles he follows writing his excellent eponymous blog. Amongst them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li>I always include <em>the names of the people</em> who created the\ncontent I am linking to, if I can figure that out. Credit is\nreally important, and it’s also useful for myself because I can\nlater search for someone’s name and find other interesting\nthings they have created that I linked to in the past. If I’ve\nlinked to someone’s work three or more times I also try to\nnotice and upgrade them to <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/\">a dedicated tag</a>. [...]</li>\n<li>If the original author reads my post, I want them to <em>feel good\nabout it</em>. I know from my own experience that often when you\npublish something online the silence can be deafening. Knowing\nthat someone else read, appreciated, understood and then shared\nyour work can be very pleasant.</li>\n<li>A slightly self-involved concern I have is that I like to <em>prove\nthat I’ve read it</em>. This is more for me than for anyone else: I\ndon’t like to recommend something if I’ve not read that thing\nmyself, and sticking in a detail that shows I read past the\nfirst paragraph helps keep me honest about that.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every step of the way, I found myself nodding my head, thinking to myself, <em>I do that too!</em> — right down to creating tags for people after I’ve mentioned their work or simply credited their bylines a few times. (The difference is that Willison seemingly isn’t a procrastinator, and I am, so my decades of tagging aren’t yet exposed to anyone but me.)</p>\n\n<p>Then I got to this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are a lot of great link blogs out there, but the one that\nhas influenced me the most in how I approach my own is John\nGruber’s <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/\">Daring Fireball</a>. I really like the way he mixes\ncommentary, quotations and value-added relevant information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And now it doesn’t seem quite as amazing that I was nodding my head in agreement with each of his guidelines. But, call me biased, it’s still a hell of a good start to a blogging rulebook.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/02/willisons-approach-to-running-a-link-blog\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b7e2becd3c8765e80119d3cd002bfe374239f93130dc9c086272949a5d1a15c4","category":"Tech"}
