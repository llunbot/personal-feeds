Yes, the Spring Classics have been and gone, the Giro d’Italia has just come to an end and we’re already gearing up for the biggest bike race of them all – the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, Simon von Bromley took us behind the scenes at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/team-movistar-behind-the-scenes/\">Movistar’s Giro d’Italia roadshow</a>, with plenty of insight from the team staff, all illustrated by Simon’s photography.</p>\n<p>This week, the hotly anticipated Netflix series <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em> was released. I got a sneak preview ahead of the release and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/tour-de-france-unchained-review/\">shared my thoughts</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s not just road racing that’s been in the headlines, however. Unbound brought a swathe of tech content to BikeRadar, where we spotted the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-grx-r820/\">new Shimano GRX groupset</a>, the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/unbound-2023-new-canyon-grail/\">Canyon Grail</a> and plenty more tech underneath mud – <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/unbound-2023-gravel-tech-gallery/\">lots of mud</a>.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-year/\">Bike of the Year</a> reviews have continued to roll out, as well, with Alex Evans reviewing the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/nukeproof-megawatt-297-rs-review/\">Nukeproof Megawatt 297 RS</a> and Warren Rossiter turning his eye to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/wilier-granturismo-slr-ultegra-di2-review/\">Wilier Granturismo SLR</a>.</p>\n<p>We also updated our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-road-bikes/\">best women’s road and gravel bikes</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/scott-contessa-addict-25-review/\">Women’s Bike of the Year winner</a> and more.</p>\n<p>There were two big releases in the world of mountain bikes. Giant updated its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-giant-glory/\">Glory downhill bike</a> and we saw Öhlins unveil a new fork and shock.</p>\n<p>It hasn’t all been racing and new tech though. Oscar Huckle provided advice on how to make your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-make-components-last-longer/\">bike components last longer</a> and how to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-straighten-a-bent-mech-hanger/\">straighten a bent derailleur hanger</a>. We also ran an explainer on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/internal-gear-hubs/\">internal gear hubs</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, Apple has announced some major updates to its Apple Watch software, which will enable you to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/apple-watch-os10-update/\">pair the watch with a power meter</a>. Should the likes of Garmin and Wahoo be worried?

It’s claimed to provide better muscle compression, moisture wicking, abrasion resistance and low weight.</p>\n<p>Backing these claims up with stats, Café du Cycliste says the Victoire Bib Shorts have a compressive force 20 per cent greater than that of bib shorts that use standard knitted fabrics and they dry 30 per cent faster, too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Café du Cycliste logo on Victoire bib shorts.\" title=\"_O5A8890\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The woven fabric is said to increase compressive force and reduce weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Café du Cycliste isn’t the first to make such claims around the benefits of woven fabrics in bib shorts. The Castelli Superleggera bib shorts also use a woven fabric to save weight, increase durability and lower sweat absorption.</p>\n<p>Inside the Victoire bib shorts is an Elastic Interface chamois pad with an “elastic memory” to keep its shape through “thousands of hours and miles”.</p>\n<p>The bib section of the shorts uses the same light mesh fabric as the Angeline Jersey.</p>\n<p>The Victoire Bib Shorts come in black or navy.</p>\n<ul><li>£274/$364/€280/AU$487</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Cyclus Barbecue</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclus barbecue.\" title=\"DSC00503\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This stainless steel barbecue has ‘Cyclus Tools’ written in the grill.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cyclus might be best known for its range of workshop-grade bicycle tools, but it also produces this miniature barbecue.</p>\n<p>Cyclus says the barbecue is made from stainless steel for long-time use.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclus barbecue charcoal tray.\" title=\"DSC00505\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bottom of the barbecue has a pull-out tray for burnt charcoal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The grill area measures 24.5x19cm and heat is said to spread evenly over this surface area for energy efficiency and low charcoal consumption.</p>\n<p>The barbecue has ‘Cyclus Tools’ written in the grill, so even your grill marks can be on brand.</p>\n<ul><li>£69.99</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>Osabjörn Everyday Road Helmet</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Osabjorn Everyday Road Helmet green outer shell.\" title=\"DSC00510\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Everyday Road Helmet will launch on Kickstarter this summer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Osabjörn Everyday Road Helmet is a new helmet launching on Kickstarter this summer.</p>\n<p>The helmet is the creation of Ben Duggan.
