Since then, AWS has provided continuous investments in infrastructure and technology to help drive digital transformations in Australia, to support hundreds of thousands of active customers each month.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a> — Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience that was first <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudfront-route-53-edge-location-in-sydney-australia/\">launched in Australia</a> alongside Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region in 2012. To further accelerate the delivery of static and dynamic web content to end users in Australia, AWS announced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/07/09/new-australia-locations-cloudfront-route53-directconnect/\">additional CloudFront locations</a> for Sydney and Melbourne in 2014. In addition, AWS also <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/announcing-regional-edge-caches-for-amazon-cloudfront/\">announced a Regional Edge Cache in 2016</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/01/cloudfront-adds-six-new-edge-locations/\">an additional CloudFront point of presence (PoP) in Perth</a> in 2018. CloudFront points of presence ensure popular content can be served quickly to your viewers. Regional Edge Caches are positioned (network-wise) between the CloudFront locations and the origin and further help to improve content performance. AWS currently has seven edge locations and one Regional Edge Cache location in Australia.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\">AWS Direct Connect</a> — As with CloudFront, the first AWS Direct Connect location was made available with Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region launch in 2012. To continue helping our customers in Australia improve application performance, secure data, and reduce networking costs, AWS announced the opening of additional Direct Connect locations in Sydney (2014), Melbourne (2016), Canberra (2017), Perth (2017), and an additional location in Sydney (2022), totaling six locations.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/\">AWS Local Zones</a> — To help customers run applications that require single-digit millisecond latency or local data processing, customers can use AWS Local Zones. They bring AWS infrastructure (compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services) closer to end users and business centers. AWS customers can run workloads with low latency requirements on the <a href=\"https://anz-resources.awscloud.com/anz-articles/aws-launches-first-australian-aws-local-zones-location-in-perth\">AWS Local Zones location in Perth</a> while seamlessly connecting to the rest of their workloads running in AWS Regions.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Upskilling Local Developers, Students, and Future IT Leaders</span><br /> </strong>Digital transformation will not happen on its own. AWS runs various programs and has trained more than 200,000 people across Australia with cloud skills since 2017. There is an additional goal to train more than 29 million people globally with free cloud skills by 2025. Here’s a brief description of related programs from AWS:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com.au/aws-re-start-program-announces-first-cohort-in-australia\">AWS re/Start</a> is a digital skills training program that prepares unemployed, underemployed, and transitioning individuals for careers in cloud computing and connects students to potential employers.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/\">AWS Academy</a> provides higher education institutions with a free, ready-to-teach cloud computing curriculum that prepares students to pursue industry-recognized certifications and in-demand cloud jobs.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/\">AWS Educate</a> provides students with access to AWS services. AWS is also collaborating with governments, educators, and the industry to help individuals, both tech and nontech workers, build and deepen their digital skills to nurture a workforce that can harness the power of cloud computing and advanced technologies.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-industry-quest/\">AWS Industry Quest</a> is a game-based training initiative designed to help professionals and teams learn and build vital cloud skills and solutions. At re:Invent 2022, AWS announced the first iteration of the program for the financial services sector. National Australia Bank (NAB) is <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/aws-industry-quest-financial-services/\">AWS Industry Quest: Financial Services</a>’ first beta customer globally. Through AWS Industry Quest, NAB has trained thousands of colleagues in cloud skills since 2018, resulting in more than 4,500 industry-recognized certifications.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In addition to the above programs, AWS is also committed to supporting Victoria’s local tech community through digital upskilling, community initiatives, and partnerships. The Victorian Digital Skills is a new program from the Victorian Government that helps create a new pipeline of talent to meet the digital skills needs of Victorian employers. AWS has taken steps to help solve the retraining challenge by supporting the <a href=\"https://djpr.vic.gov.au/digital-jobs\">Victorian Digital Skills Program</a>, which enables mid-career Victorians to reskill on technology and gain access to higher-paying jobs.</p> \n<p><strong><span>The Climate Pledge</span><br /> </strong>Amazon is committed to investing and innovating across its businesses to help create a more sustainable future. With <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/planet/climate-pledge\">The Climate Pledge</a>, Amazon is committed to reaching net-zero carbon across its business by 2040 and is on a path to powering its operations with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com.au/amazons-first-solar-projects-in-australia-start-producing-clean-energy\">As of May 2022</a>, two projects in Australia are operational. Amazon Solar Farm Australia – Gunnedah and Amazon Solar Farm Australia – Suntop will aim to generate 392,000 MWh of renewable energy each year, equal to the annual electricity consumption of 63,000 Australian homes. Once Amazon Wind Farm Australia – Hawkesdale also becomes operational, it will boost the projects’ combined yearly renewable energy generation to 717,000 MWh, or enough for nearly 115,000 Australian homes.</p> \n<p><strong><span>AWS Customers in Australia</span><br /> </strong>We have customers in Australia that are doing incredible things with AWS, for example:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/national-australia-bank-digital-transformation-case-study/\"><strong>National Australia Bank Limited (NAB)</strong></a><br /> NAB is one of Australia’s largest banks and Australia’s largest business bank. “We have been exploring the potential use cases with AWS since the announcement of the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-day-225779/\">Steve Day</a>, Chief Technology Officer at NAB.</p> \n<p>Locating key banking applications and critical workloads geographically close to their compute platform and the bulk of their corporate workforce will provide lower latency benefits.
