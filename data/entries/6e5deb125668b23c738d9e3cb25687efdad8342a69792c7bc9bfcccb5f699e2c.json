The video doesn’t show much new either but appears to offer confirmation that the iPhone SE will have a notch <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2583113/new-leak-changes-everything-we-know-about-the-iphone-se-4.html\">rather than a Dynamic Island</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is hardly a surprising look, and definitely not innovative, it’s exactly what we expect from an iPhone SE: modern processors in an older body with reduced camera capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Apple still sells the iPhone 14 for $599 (U.S.), which makes one wonder what will happen once this launches. Why buy an iPhone 14 for more money when the presumably less-expensive iPhone SE 4 looks and feels the same has a faster processor and presumably costs less? We should know the answer soon enough, as Apple is expected to launch the new phone in March or April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">roundup of all the latest iPhone SE 4 rumors and leaks</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6e5deb125668b23c738d9e3cb25687efdad8342a69792c7bc9bfcccb5f699e2c","category":"Apple"}
