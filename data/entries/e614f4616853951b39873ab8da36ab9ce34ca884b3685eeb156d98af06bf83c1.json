Based on developer Naughty Dog's hugely popular video game franchise, S2 is set five years after the events of the first season and finds the bond beginning to fray between plucky survivors Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) while introducing several new characters.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/meet-the-real-zombifying-fungus-behind-the-fictional-last-of-us-outbreak/\">The series takes place</a> in the 20-year aftermath of a deadly outbreak of mutant fungus (<em>Cordyceps</em>) that turns humans into monstrous zombie-like creatures (the Infected, or Clickers). The world has become a series of separate totalitarian quarantine zones and independent settlements, with a thriving black market and a rebel militia known as the Fireflies making life complicated for the survivors. Joel is a hardened smuggler tasked with escorting the teenage Ellie across the devastated US, battling hostile forces and hordes of zombies, to a Fireflies unit outside the quarantine zone. Ellie is special: She is immune to the deadly fungus, and the hope is that her immunity holds the key to beating the disease.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/we-have-a-new-teaser-for-the-last-of-us-s2/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/we-have-a-new-teaser-for-the-last-of-us-s2/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e614f4616853951b39873ab8da36ab9ce34ca884b3685eeb156d98af06bf83c1","category":"Tech"}
