However, too often we end up picking at our physical self, always asking to be stronger, thinner,  or fitter instead of appreciating all that our bodies allow us to do. Marley Blonsky believes that all bodies, all people, should feel comfortable and included while riding. We need to focus less on what we look like and more on just how amazing it is to ride a bike.”</p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reeseruland/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Reese</a> for doing such a great job on these video series profiles!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f25bceff3a6d57193356b4e7ee7b0fc69b35192ffc29986d67d64de1d0e50877","category":"Cycling"}
