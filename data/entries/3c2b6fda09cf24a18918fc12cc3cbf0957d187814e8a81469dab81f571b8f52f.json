The autonomous vehicles, which provide tens of thousands of rides each week, have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYTZRb-SWhY\">torched</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-person-seen-trashing-waymo-car-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\">stomped on</a>, and <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/16/san-francisco-waymo-video-assault-police-say/\" target=\"_blank\">verbally berated</a> in recent months. Now Waymo is striking back—in the courts.</p>\n<p>This month, the Silicon Valley company filed a pair of lawsuits, neither of which have been previously reported, that demand hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from two alleged vandals. Waymo attorneys said in court papers that the alleged vandalism, which ruined dozens of tires and a tail end, are a significant threat to the company’s reputation. Riding in a vehicle in which the steering wheel swivels on its own can be scary enough. Having to worry about attackers allegedly targeting the rides could undermine Waymo’s ride-hailing business before it even gets past its earliest stage. </p><div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\" /></div>\n<p>Waymo, which falls under the umbrella of Google parent Alphabet, operates a ride-hailing service in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/robotaxis-cruise-waymo-san-francisco/\">San Francisco</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/32-hours-chandler-arizona-self-driving-capital/\">Phoenix</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-los-angeles-robotaxi-autonomous-car-approval/\">Los Angeles</a> that is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/uber-and-lyft-drivers-advice-autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-cars-taxis/\">comparable to Uber and Lyft</a> except with sensors and software controlling the driving. While its cars haven’t contributed to any known deadly crashes, US regulators continue to probe their <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/robot-cars-are-causing-911-false-alarms-in-san-francisco/\">sometimes</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dashcam-footage-shows-driverless-cars-cruise-waymo-clogging-san-francisco/\">erratic driving</a>. Waymo spokesperson Sandy Karp says the company always prioritizes safety and that the lawsuits reflect that strategy. She declined further comment for this story.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038514#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038514&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3c2b6fda09cf24a18918fc12cc3cbf0957d187814e8a81469dab81f571b8f52f","category":"Tech"}
