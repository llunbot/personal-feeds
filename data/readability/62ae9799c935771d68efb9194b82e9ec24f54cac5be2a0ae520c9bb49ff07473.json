During his time at the Sunweb/DSM organization, he added a Paris-Nice stage win and two GC top five finishes at the race – including runner-up honors in 2020 – to his career palmares.</p><p>Apparently, however, the 27-year-old Belgian won’t be sticking around to see out the full term of his contract. Wielerflits reports that Benoot is now on the hunt for a new squad after what the Dutch outlet described as an “irreparable rift” developed between rider and team.</p><p>In departing DSM early, Benoot joins some esteemed company.</p><p>Among the many pro riders who have left the organization before their contracts were up over the past several seasons are Marcel Kittel, Warren Barguil, Tom Dumoulin, Michael Matthews, and Marc Hirschi.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"62ae9799c935771d68efb9194b82e9ec24f54cac5be2a0ae520c9bb49ff07473","category":"Cycling"}
