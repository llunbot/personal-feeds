He followed up with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1692558493255942213\">another post</a>:\n“It makes no sense.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Twitter founder and multi-time former CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1692583743884509668\">Jack Dorsey</a> (capitalization <em>sic</em>): “💯. mute only.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety\">Apple’s App Store Guidelines</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1.2 User-Generated Content</p>\n\n<p>Apps with user-generated content present particular challenges,\nranging from intellectual property infringement to anonymous\nbullying. To prevent abuse, apps with user-generated content or\nsocial networking services must include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A method for filtering objectionable material from being posted\nto the app</li>\n<li>A mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to\nconcerns</li>\n<li>The ability to block abusive users from the service</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Excerpted from <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9876937?hl=en\">Google’s Play Store Policy Center on “User Generated Content”</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apps that contain or feature UGC, including apps which are\nspecialized browsers or clients to direct users to a UGC platform,\nmust implement robust, effective, and ongoing UGC moderation that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Conducts UGC moderation, as is reasonable and consistent with\nthe type of UGC hosted by the app; [...]</li>\n<li>Provides an in-app system for reporting objectionable UGC and\nusers, and takes action against that UGC and/or user where\nappropriate;</li>\n<li>Provides an in-app system for blocking UGC and users;</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both platforms thus require social media apps to support users being able to block other users. Google’s language is unambiguous. The rub is how “blocking” is defined. If all Musk wants to do is changing blocking to mean that blocked users can still <em>see</em> tweets from users who blocked them, but can’t interact (reply, quote, retweet) with them, I think that’s fine. Blocked users can see those tweets by just opening a private/incognito browser tab as it stands. But if Musk wants to truly “delete” the block feature, he’s going to run right into Apple and Google’s app store rules. Google is arguably stricter than Apple about enforcing UGC rules, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1129024148/google-truth-social-trump\">having kept Donald Trump’s Truth Social app out of the Play Store for months</a> (after it was available in Apple’s App Store) citing insufficient content moderation.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d53955a088765fa2200664ab93197baf77fed67b6459db100e8976160dc17489","category":"Tech"}
