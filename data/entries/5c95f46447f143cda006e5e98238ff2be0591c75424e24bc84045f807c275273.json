Project 4 is the first real lightweight eMTB for Thok, powered by the latest Bosch SX motor and designed to plug-and-play any of 4 different smaller batteries under the downtube to keep weight to a minimum and tailor pedal-assist range to individual rider needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thok Project 4 lightweight 3D-printed alloy eMTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio.jpg\" alt=\"Thok Project 4 eMTB prototype, lightweight 3D-printed alloy all-mountain ebike, studio complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thok-Project-4-eMTB-prototype_lightweight-3D-printed-alloy-all-mountain-ebike_studio-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>studio photo c.
