There’s a couple people doing the small wheel cargo fork thing, which I Love. This is that, with one key improvement. The rack doesn’t turn with the steering. If you have a heavy load, it stays pointed straight ahead with the frame, subtle yet important. You can see the head tube is extended, and the rack supports are attached to it, as well as the downtube. It makes for a stable platform to attach the net/platform, which is great for hauling, say, a frame box with some padded envelopes below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-15.jpg?fit=1200,802&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-15.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-15.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-15.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-15.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-16.jpg?fit=1200,802&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-16.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-16.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-16.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-16.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-8.jpg?fit=1200,802&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-8.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-8.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-8.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-8.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Next, that drivetrain tho. Fiz requested a derailleur hanger and a 1×12 drivetrain. Translation, “this bebe needs gears.” I thought, how can we do gears without messing with the OG Schwinn Style? How about a fully internal, cable-less 2×2 setup. The crank/bb is a Schlumpf drive that gives us a direct drive and a mild overdrive. The rear hub is a 2-speed kickback. 4 nicely spaced speeds that will let Fiz go up and down all the hills in Singapore.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-14.jpg?fit=1200,802&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-14.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-14.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-14.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-14.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>While we’re at it, let’s go with a matching Sturmey drum/generator setup for a strong front brake with an always-on headlight…mounted under the rack for better contrast and no box interference.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-11.jpg?fit=1200,802&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-11.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-11.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-11.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-11.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-17.jpg?fit=1200,802&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-17.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-17.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-17.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-17.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-6.jpg?fit=1200,802&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-6.jpg?w=1616&amp;quality=75 1616w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-6.jpg?resize=1200,802&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-6.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/MoneBikes-step-through-cycle-truck-6.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Here we are at the 6th paragraph, where we quickly mention the beautiful brass bits, brazed stem, and <a href=\"https://www.monebikes.com/store/oddmon-bar\" target=\"_blank\">Oddmonē bars</a>.
