Although you can operate it like a conventional 2×12-speed system, the new Vistar // Classified gearing can be configured to offer 16 sequential gears for road or 15 for gravel use. Fitted with an 11-42 tooth cassette, this offers a wider 530% range than the alternatives from SRAM and Shimano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vistar // Classified system will be available from Q3 2024, with prices yet to be announced.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/gravel-bike-groupsets\">Gravel groupsets reviewed: Shimano vs SRAM vs Campagnolo</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-electronic-shifting\">Opinion: Down with electronic shifting!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\">Gravel bike gearing: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/classified-powershift-hub-review\">Classified Powershift hub review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bicycle-gear-ratios-explained\">Bicycle gear ratios explained</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\">Buyer’s guide to road bike groupsets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Shift under load</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgian brand <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/classified-powershift-hub-review\" target=\"_blank\">Classified’s Powershift hub</a> gear offers the benefits of a 2x system with a single chainring, with two sets of ratios available via gearing in the rear wheel’s hub. It’s a pared-down version of a multispeed hub gear, which rivals a two chainring system in weight and allows shifting under load as the planetary gears are continuously engaged. Shifting usually requires a satellite shifter-style button on the bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We loved the fast shifting under load without the risk of chain drop when we reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/classified-powershift-hub-review\" target=\"_blank\">Classified Powershift</a> system in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Classified has joined forces with TRP to create a complete wireless electronic <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">groupset</a> called Vistar // Powershift. This combines derailleur shifting over a 12-speed TRP cassette with the Powershift hub to provide 15 or 16 sequential gears with the potential for a huge range of over 530%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system logic takes care of deciding whether your next gear up or down requires a derailleur shift or a change in the Powershift hub gear ratios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer, you can also choose to work the two systems separately, as with a conventional 2x system, to provide 24 gears, although as with a 2x groupset, you’ll then have gear ratio overlaps, which the sequential setup avoids.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Road and gravel configuration options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-1.jpg\" alt=\"Classified TRP Vistar // Powershift groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-1.jpg 800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-1-750x563.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vistar // Powershift system is available in two configurations, with either 16 discrete <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bicycle-gear-ratios-explained\" target=\"_blank\">ratios</a> for road use or 15 for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\">gravel use</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Classified hub is paired with an 11-40t cassette, Vistar // Powershift provides a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">gear range</a> of over 530%. For comparison, a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM mullet build</a> has a 520% maximum range and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-rx820-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano GRX 12-speed</a> Unstoppable offers 510% range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the benefits claimed for the new system – besides eliminating the risk of chain drop and crunch-free shifting under load – are increased drivetrain efficiency and lower frictional loss than a conventional 2x system. There should be less wear on components, as the system logic helps to maintain a straighter chainline and the single chainring is larger than the small ring in a 2x system. You can also shift when stationary, thanks to the Classified hub’s continuous engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-2.jpg\" alt=\"Classified TRP Vistar // Powershift groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-2.jpg 800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Classified-TRP-Vistar-Powershift-groupset-2-750x563.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Without two rings and a front mech, the system is claimed to be more aero too. There’s a Classified aero chainset available, as well as a standard open sided design. The derailleur battery is removeable for charging, which also means that you can carry a spare in case it runs flat on longer rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the groupset also includes TRP’s hydraulic disc brakes, which the brands say offer one-finger braking, with the brake levers designed for ergonomics for a wide range of hand sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">TRP</a> is best known for its brakes, it also sells two 1x MTB groupsets with mechanical shifting over cassettes up to 10-52t. It claims that the Wave tech in the Vistar // Classified cassette, as with other brands’ systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cassette\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano’s Hyperglide+</a>, offers rapid shifting between sprockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vistar // Classified has already seen action at the 2024 Unbound Gravel race with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/classified-sponsors-gravel-team-and-launches-three-new-wheelsets\" target=\"_blank\">Classified Ridley Factory Team</a>‘s Arno van der Broeck using it in the premier nine-hour 200-mile race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no word yet on pricing, but we do know that Vistar // Classified is expected to be launched towards the end of Q3 2024, when further details of the system and its gearing options will be made available.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n
