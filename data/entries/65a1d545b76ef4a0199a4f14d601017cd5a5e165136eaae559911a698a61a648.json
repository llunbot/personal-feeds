It gives up nothing when compared to modern, high-tech, carbon bikes on smooth, ideal roads and is far better in every way when conditions are crappy. Potholes? Chipseal? Hardpack gravel? The Roadini is built for it. It has way more tire clearance, higher quality overall construction, is more comfortable, and rides like a Rivendell. This new version is fully lugged, including a stunning asymmetrical (front to rear) fork crown, and comes in either Lime Olive (pictured) or Hi Ho Silver. Built it with a demi porteur bar, a road drop, or whatever. The Lugged Roadini pre-sale ($1,750) begins at 12 noon PST today at <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/lugged-roadini\" target=\"_blank\">Rivendell</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rivendells-lugged-roadini-pre-sale-opens-today-at-noon-pst/\">Rivendell’s Lugged Roadini Pre-Sale Opens Today at Noon PST</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"65a1d545b76ef4a0199a4f14d601017cd5a5e165136eaae559911a698a61a648","category":"Cycling"}
