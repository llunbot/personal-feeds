True Scots were loyal to Irn-Bru.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A map produced in 2017 showed Scotland as the single tiny outpost standing firm against the red tide of the ‘The Real Thing’ that covered the globe. But unfortunately, it turns out it wasn’t true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, sure enough, the Scots still drink gallons more of the sugary, weird-tasting orange stuff than they do the sugary, tooth-rotting brown stuff, but it seems that there are other countries that are also devoted to their native brands, such as Inca Kola in Peru and TuKola in Cuba. Scotland isn’t so special.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">Best of the best gravel bikes 2023: Cyclist’s top-rated gravel and adventure bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2024 route headlined by double Monte Grappa ascent</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024 route announced: What will riders face on the road from Florence to Nice?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>I only mention this because, as any Scottish readers will attest, it can be a disheartening business looking for instances to indulge in some nationalistic pride (don’t get me started on the Rugby World Cup), but there is something that we can still cling to. The world owes Scotland a debt of gratitude for the glorious gift of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was back in 1839 that Scottish blacksmith Kirkpatrick Macmillan first wobbled his wooden contraption onto the dirt roads of Dumfriesshire, heralding the dawn of the pedal bicycle (read the whole story on p74 of issue 146). If it wasn’t for him, you’d now be reading a magazine called HobbyHorseist, and we’d be reviewing the best shoes for propelling yourself along the ground on a glorified scooter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be a pretty rough ride too, were it not for another Scotsman, John Boyd Dunlop, inventor of the pneumatic tyre. Or John Macadam, who gave us macadamised roads. He was Scottish too. And you wouldn’t be able to watch cycling on your telly if it wasn’t for John Logie Baird (Scottish), or on your phone if not for Alexander Graham Bell (Scottish).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. If you see a Scot on a bike, give them a little wave of thanks. That’s all I ask. Right, I’m off for a Tunnock’s Tea Cake washed down with a litre of Irn-Bru.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Juan Trujillo Andrades</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 146?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The giant killer:</strong> On Turkey’s south coast is a climb that is new to the pro peloton but may be destined to become the most feared of them all. <em>Cyclist</em> feels the force of Babadağ</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Godfather of gravel:</strong> Before gravel there was the ‘Jobst ride’.
