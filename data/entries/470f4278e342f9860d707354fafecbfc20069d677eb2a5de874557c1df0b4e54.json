Wireless charging without the perfect alignment that\nMagSafe allows is troubling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve been waiting for iFixit’s teardown to see if removing MagSafe components might help explain the 16e’s physically larger battery. It doesn’t seem to. The 16e battery seems taller, not thicker, and the MagSafe components in an iPhone 15 don’t seem thick or space consuming.</p>\n\n<p>The 16e did garner a 7/10 repairability score — very high for an Apple product from iFixit. But their party line is that you still shouldn’t buy one, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/108337/why-a-refurbished-iphone-might-be-better-and-cheaper-than-a-brand-new-iphone-16e\">opting instead for a refurbished older iPhone 14</a>. Refurb iPhones are great, and they’re popular for a reason, but it feels like recommending refurb over new is dogma for iFixit at this point. When’s the last time they recommended any new product? For $600 I think it’s hard to beat a new iPhone 16e for current value and future-proofing.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/ifixit-iphone-16e-teardown\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"470f4278e342f9860d707354fafecbfc20069d677eb2a5de874557c1df0b4e54","category":"Tech"}
