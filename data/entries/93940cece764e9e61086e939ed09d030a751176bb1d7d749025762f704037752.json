Notably, the machine is running a special 24C2101 build of macOS Sequoia 15.2 – the same version that Apple accidentally released back in December that originally <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/macos-sequoia-15-2-m4-macbook-air-leak/\">confirmed the existence</a> of next-generation 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models. This strongly suggests the benchmark is legit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the result, the machine recorded a Metal score of 55,516. Scores for the existing 13-inch M4 iPad Pro are <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/search?k=v6_compute&amp;page=1&amp;q=iPad16%2C6&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\">in the same ballpark</a>, which we would expect. For added context, the existing M3 MacBook Air averages a Metal score of around <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/search?k=v6_compute&amp;q=mac15%2C13&amp;utf8=✓\">48-49,000</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the MacBook Air and iPad Pro lack fans for thermal management, so it makes sense that there would be little if any difference between the chips' graphics performance. For comparison, an M4 MacBook Pro with fans can average around ~57,000 on the same benchmark. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/23/m4-macbook-air-march-debut-retail-teams/\">latest report</a>, Apple is preparing its marketing, sales, and retail teams for a March launch of new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models. Gurman has previously said the new models will be released \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/\">within weeks.</a>\" Apart from the new M4 chip, no other significant revisions are expected.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/m4-macbook-air-benchmark-surfaces-gpu/\">M4 MacBook Air Benchmark Suggests GPU on Par With M4 iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macbook-air-benchmark-suggests-gpu-on-par-with-m4-ipad-pro.2450076/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"93940cece764e9e61086e939ed09d030a751176bb1d7d749025762f704037752","category":"Apple"}
