{"title":"Mona: Mastodon Client for Mac and iOS","link":"https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp","date":1685207900000,"content":"\n<p>I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/26/ivory-for-mac\">quipped yesterday</a> that I thought Ivory for Mac wasn’t just the best Mac Mastodon client, but the only good one. A <a href=\"https://appdot.net/@lapcatsoftware/110438201331572138\">bunch</a> of readers <a href=\"https://masto.ai/@felixbernoully/110439214565712262\">chimed in</a> to <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@ender3/110441484789265773\">endorse</a> Mona, by Junyu Kuang, as a good Mac client. I had tried Mona a while back, and found it lacking in numerous ways on the Mac, but I took another look yesterday and my readers are correct: it’s a very solid Mac client now. Free to try, $10 to go “pro” on any one platform (Mac, iPhone, iPad), and just $16 to go pro on all three. Those are <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp/110418544209519828\">introductory prices</a> that are going up on June 1.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/27/mona\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dff3ff5e6768c7c4880b1b7112e85f72413f74d95cc245a4403658dfc462c123","category":"Tech"}
