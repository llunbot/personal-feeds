We've seen the headphones fall to this price on numerous occasions <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/sony-wh1000xm4-noise-cancelling-headphones-announced/\" target=\"_blank\">since they launched</a> last year, and they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2021-headphones-earbuds-sony-jabra/\" target=\"_blank\">dropped as low at $248</a> during Amazon's Prime Day event in June. Outside of major shopping events like those, though, this is usually the best price you'll see for this wonderfully well-rounded pair of wireless headphones that we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/#h25\" target=\"_blank\">recommended in various buying guides</a> over the past year. Their sound runs bass-heavy by default, but that can be customized, and their general comfort and noise-canceling strength are still among the most impressive we've seen for a headphone under $500.</p>\n<p>Besides that, our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/finding-the-best-wireless-mouse-for-your-desktop-for-both-work-and-gaming/\" target=\"_blank\">top pick among wireless office mice</a>, Logitech's MX Master 3, is <a href=\"https://fave.co/3zcvc56\" target=\"_blank\">currently available for $80</a> at Staples when you use the code \"90453\" at checkout. That's only $5 above the best price we've tracked. The mouse itself remains highly comfortable (if you're right-handed, at least) and is reliably performant on most surfaces (glass included). It can pair with up to three devices over Bluetooth or an included USB dongle, and the whole thing is nicely versatile, with a nifty second scroll wheel, five programmable buttons, and the ability to make app-specific customizations through Logitech's companion software. It's undeniably expensive—our guide above has more affordable options if you're on a budget—but if you spend all day at your desk, it may be worth the premium.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, our deals roundup includes all-time low or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AcJe6p\" target=\"_blank\">near-low prices</a> on a couple of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xkk1F7\" target=\"_blank\">three-quart Instant Pots</a>—meaning they're best for one or two people, not full families—as well as a new low for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VsYXiE\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung's SSD 980</a>, which we found to be a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/new-samsung-980-ssd-improves-on-970-evo-evo-plus-performance/\" target=\"_blank\">worthwhile midrange drive</a> for everyday consumers in a review earlier this year. We also have good prices on Apple's 15 W MagSafe wireless charger, which we recommended in our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/best-magsafe-accessories-for-iphone-12/\" target=\"_blank\">guide to the best iPhone 12 accessories</a>. Sony's and Microsoft's summer game sales continue <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/cb1f8320-c804-44eb-bd95-a92490a510d9/1\" target=\"_blank\">for PlayStation</a> and <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=dealmaster072421%7Cxid:fr1628083921272gah&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fpromotions%2Fsales%2Fultimate-game-sale\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox consoles</a>, respectively, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/07/best-video-game-deals-playstation-summer-sale-xbox-ultimate-game-sale/\" target=\"_blank\">highlights of which we pulled out</a> late last month.
