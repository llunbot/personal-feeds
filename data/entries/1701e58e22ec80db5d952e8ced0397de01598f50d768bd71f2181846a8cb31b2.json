He shifted his focus to the Giro this season and took an emphatic overall victory there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is a beautiful and fantastic memory,” he said of the Giro win. “It had enormous personal and sporting significance for me, for my team and for our country it was something very cool. It had a very high cost in both individual and collective physical and mental effort but it is a triumph that we will not forget.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernal went on to race the Vuelta this season, finishing sixth there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ineos Grenadiers have yet to say anything about whether he will indeed be on the start line in Copenhagen in July of 2022, but Bernal is looking at the French Grand Tour with renewed interest and, apparently, a much improved back. As he told Revista Mundo Ciclistico, “I think I have fully recovered, but nevertheless we have been monitoring the evolution through physiotherapy sessions, strengthening with gym attendance, hoping to start the cycling year and continue without anything that could affect performance on the bike.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/egan-bernal-is-eyeing-a-return-to-the-tour-de-france-in-2022/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1701e58e22ec80db5d952e8ced0397de01598f50d768bd71f2181846a8cb31b2","category":"Cycling"}
