For fans of pen input there isn't much out there other than this and the Galaxy S Ultra line, but for $400 you can get a phone with a stowable stylus.</p>\n<p>The design is just a bit interesting thanks to the \"vegan leather\" (that's a type of plastic) back, which gives the phone some personality. You get flat aluminum sides, a flat screen, and a hole-punch camera. Android does not have a lot of built-in stylus features, so you'll mostly be relying on whatever Motorola has cooked up; <a href=\"https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-stylus-5g-gen-4/p\">the website</a> only shows a \"Moto Note\" app and the ability to send your drawings over instant messaging, plus there's whatever you can find on the Play Store.</p>\n<p>This is a mid-range phone, so for the SoC, we have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1. That's four Arm Cortex A78 cores and four Cortex A55 cores, built with a quite modern 4 nm process. There's a 6.7-inch, 120 Hz, 2400Ã—1080 OLED display, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 5000 mAh battery with 30 W wired charging and 15 W wireless charging. Pictures will come from a 50 MP main camera, 13 MP wide-angle, or a front 32 MP camera. There's a MicroSD slot, headphone jack, in-screen fingerprint reader, stowable stylus (of course), and NFC. Wi-Fi only goes up to 802.11ac. That's \"Wi-Fi 5\" and is pretty old, but it will get the job done, I guess. The \"IP52\" dust- and water-resistant rating is also not great, promising only protection from some water drops at certain angles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023083#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023083&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f71fcb000a585afe5497bd9b308388aa4d091fb625e778c276ee47bb938aaa6","category":"Tech"}
