Dubbed the Apple Watch Series 7, it has a new retina display with 20% more screen area, brighter indoor performance, and smaller bezels that are 40% thinner.</p>\n<p>Apple says the screen is the most durable \"crack resistant\" display on an Apple Watch, thanks to \"stronger geometry.\" The Series 7 is also IPX6 dust resistant, a first for Apple Watches, in addition to being \"swimproof.\"</p>\n<p>There hasn't been much said with regard to new internals. Apple didn't mention a new chip or any other computing components. But there have finally been improvements to charging speeds. With the new USB-C Apple Watch charger, Apple says the Series 7 can charge from zero to 80% in 45 minutes and achieve eight hours of sleep tracking from just an eight-minute charge. Although Series 7's battery charges 33 percent faster than its predecessor, it still has the same 18-hour battery life as the Series 6.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794493#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794493&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ec5dc58eda85435bae661d36cdb22e50ca4d83870aa80adb454c0c27c913ff7","category":"Tech"}
