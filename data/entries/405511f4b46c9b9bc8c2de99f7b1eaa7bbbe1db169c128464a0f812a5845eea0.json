The private portion of those authentication keys does not seem to have been uncovered yet, and probably won't be found on the system itself. Still, the symmetric keys in question should prove useful for enabling further analysis of the PS5 system software and discovering other exploits that could lead to the execution of unsigned code. Ars regrets the error.]</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811284#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811284&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"405511f4b46c9b9bc8c2de99f7b1eaa7bbbe1db169c128464a0f812a5845eea0","category":"Tech"}
