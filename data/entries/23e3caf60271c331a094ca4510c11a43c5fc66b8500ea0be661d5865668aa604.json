{"title":"Review: Amazon’s Kindle Colorsoft is something less than “a Paperwhite with color”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/","date":1743528029000,"content":"<p>It has been a bumpy start for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P\">Amazon's $280 Kindle Colorsoft</a>, the company's first E-Ink book reader with a color screen. The company delayed shipments for a few weeks to correct a problem where a faint yellow band would appear across the bottom of the screen, something that has apparently been fixed for current versions of the reader (Amazon says it has made \"the appropriate adjustments\" to fix the problem but hasn't been specific about what those adjustments are).</p>\n<p>Amazon didn't send us a Colorsoft for review at the time, maybe in part because of this problem early reviewers had, but we finally got one a few weeks ago and have been using it since then.</p>\n<p>My main takeaway is that I don't <em>mind</em> the Colorsoft, but it also doesn't solve any problems I was having with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/review-amazons-2024-kindle-paperwhite-makes-the-best-e-reader-a-little-better/\">the monochrome Kindle Paperwhite</a>, and it doesn't meaningfully solve the big problems with color E-Ink. It also makes the experience of reading regular text subtly worse, which accounts for the vast majority of my Kindle activity. I'm curious to see future riffs on the idea, but this initial implementation leaves me cold.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"23e3caf60271c331a094ca4510c11a43c5fc66b8500ea0be661d5865668aa604","category":"Tech"}
