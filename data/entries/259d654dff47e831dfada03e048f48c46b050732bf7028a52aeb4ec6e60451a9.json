But, then again racing is such a tiny part of what makes up the event. This is the place for you if you want community over competition. Over the last 12 years, the sleepy streets of Stillwater, Oklahoma, have been bursting with runners and bicyclists from all over the world, just as the students of OSU spend their spring break out of town. This weekend in March has been reserved in so many folks’ hearts and calendars as The Mid South weekend, rain or shine. And believe me, I’d pick this part of the country over where I usually reside at this time of the year ten out of ten times.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-25.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-25.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-25.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-29.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-29.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-29.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-13.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-13.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>So what does an event with no cash purse offer to its competitors, cough: its attendees? Love, joy, and hope. It is a special place for folks from all over to feel good. What I mean is in a world filled with hate, this beacon of an event, of a community, is something that can provide folks with hope year round, in Oklahoma, no less. No really, you can ride this wave for 365, it’s just that good. It’s a place that can show you what real family and friends are about. Few places can provide what this crew does.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-22.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-22.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-22.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-22.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-27.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-27.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-27.jpg?resize=1200,1800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-27.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-27.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w\" /></p>\n<p>Not your grandpa’s gravel race, the three-day festival was stacked with rides—like the Salsa Denim Ride and the Chamois Butter X Sad Velo Ride—and non-stop live music from: Tyler Siems, Bobcat (with special guest Rhett Shull), King Cabbage Brass Band, and Belle and The Vertigo Waves, just to name a few.

Having spent time at the back of the pack on a lot of gravel rides with cutoffs, I found something pretty special in hearing that folks rolling into the halfway point who want to keep going aren’t cut off, and because of this, there will be folks waiting at the finish line ready to welcome them with stoke, a hug, and finisher regalia, whether a rider is number 1 or 3469.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-77.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-77.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-77.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-77.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-77.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-70.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-70.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-70.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-70.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-70.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>It is hard to express how great a feeling it is to be appreciated, seen, and allowed to wrap a ride under your agency, no matter your body size or fitness, because maybe that moment is the thing that can get you out of a dark place. I know, I’ve been there. Conspirators and friends over at The Mid South have been converging for years and while the scale of the event has grown three fold, to over 3,000 attendees, since the first time I touched down in Oklahoma in 2017, it hasn’t lost what makes its special.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-111.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-111.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-111.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-111.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-111.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I’d only ever witnessed the event from the course over the last five year, but this year, the Mid South really came alive for me in the hours after dark. In Oklahoma the sunsets are some of the longest out there. I got to see folks roll in as and after the sun set but the party doesn’t stop until the last rider is in. Last place or, to use the event’s term, “dead fucking last (DFL),” is celebrated here, and by many.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-113.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-113.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-113.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-113.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-113.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-115.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-115.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-115.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-115.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-115.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-116.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-116.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-116.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-116.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-116.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>How many?

Heart! Everyone I’ve encountered from earlier in the week til the event wrapped, has something special about them. Sure, there’s the hustle, but there’s something so much larger here than words or a gallery could ever clue you into. Folks fill each other’s hearts with love; this year may have been the most love-filled. Bobby really drove home that everyone should be present and that being present is a present. Maybe you’ve had a rough few years, and the fact that you’re still breathing is the greatest gift ever. Take time to appreciate that and hold onto hope while you can.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-117.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-117.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-117.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-117.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024-Mid-South-Gravel-Race-117.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>The Mid South continues its legacy of love and elation next year from March 13-16 2025, will you be at the finish line to get your Bobby hug?
