The poster of the photos claimed that they are working for a carrier who was testing the Series 7 before it officially goes on sale \"later this fall.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've so far only seen the Series 7 in Apple's marketing and promotional materials, and the company has yet to announce a date for when it will be available for purchase. The images shared today offer us our first hands-on look at the Series 7 with its larger and more expansive display. Despite rumors, the Series 7 does not feature flat-edges but instead \"more rounded and softer corners,\" which allows the display to curve slightly over the sides.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe larger display is one of just a few design changes for the Series 7 compared to the previous generation. The Series 7 features an improved IP6X rating for dust and water resistance but internally maintains the same CPU as the Apple Watch Series 6.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile there certainly could be more internal changes for the Series 7, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on the watch itself to learn about them.
