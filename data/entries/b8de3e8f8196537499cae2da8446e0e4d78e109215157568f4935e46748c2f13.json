This does make some intuitive sense if you assume that a smaller heatsink will automatically be worse at dissipating heat. But more detailed and precise testing from the YouTubers at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwu_fkYwLEQ\">Hardware Busters International</a> backs up our skepticism of that claim, showing that the PS5's exhaust air is warmer because the new cooling system is doing a better job of removing heat from the console, as cooling systems are meant to do.</p>\n\n<p>The Hardware Busters testing measured the temperature of the APU, memory, voltage regulator modules (VRMs), and exhaust air while <em>Devil May Cry 5 </em>was running on both PS5 models. The exhaust air is indeed a few degrees warmer in the new PS5 than the old one, but on average, the new PS5's APU ran about 11°C cooler, dropping from about 51°C to 40°C.</p>\n<p>The memory and VRM temperatures in the new PS5 rise a bit—the memory temperature goes up by around 7°C and the VRM temperature goes up by around 1.3°C—but neither increase should have a huge impact on the console's reliability or longevity. The much larger drop in APU temperature is worth the tradeoff.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793565#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793565&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b8de3e8f8196537499cae2da8446e0e4d78e109215157568f4935e46748c2f13","category":"Tech"}
