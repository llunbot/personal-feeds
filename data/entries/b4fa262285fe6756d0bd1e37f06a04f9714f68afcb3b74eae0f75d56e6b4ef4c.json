Enjoy the extra sleep.\" Apple used to do new device pre-orders at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time, but since 2019, has been holding <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> pre-orders at 5:00 a.m.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌‌iPhone 13‌ mini, ‌iPhone 13‌,‌ ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max are launching in more than 30 countries and regions around the world, and a full list of launch times can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/when-to-pre-order-iphone-13-pro-max-time-zones/\">time zone guide</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the new ‌iPhone 13‌ models are nearly identical in design to last year's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models, featuring flat edges, an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure, a glass back, and a slight increase in thickness. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKey features across the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch.
