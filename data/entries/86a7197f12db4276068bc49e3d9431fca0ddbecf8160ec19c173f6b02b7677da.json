Google employee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackK/status/1641803581300031488\">Jack Krawczyk</a> announced the change on Twitter, saying, \"Now Bard will better understand and respond to your prompts for multi-step word and math problems, with coding coming soon.\"</p>\n<p>Logic questions were a big flaw when Bard arrived tens of days ago, and some answers made Bard seem particularly dumb to early testers. In one example from last week, Bard repeatedly asserted that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1639762008491868161\">one plus two equaled four</a>. Today, Google's state-of-the-art AI chatbot models can now correctly say that the answer is three. So there has been at least some change. It can also correctly list the months in a year instead of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ItakGol/status/1638321167818735616\">making up names</a> like \"Maruary.\"</p>\n<p>Bard still gets tripped up by really basic logic questions, though. HowToGeek's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisbhoffman/status/1638266057524752384\">Chris Hoffman</a> posed the question to Bard on day one, \"What's heavier, five pounds of feathers or a one pound dumbbell?\" Google Bard responded with the ridiculous claim that \"There's no such thing as 5 pounds of feathers.\" In the replies, ChatGPT didn't do any better, saying that five pounds of feathers and a one pound dumbbells \"weigh the same amount, which is five pounds.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928370#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928370&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86a7197f12db4276068bc49e3d9431fca0ddbecf8160ec19c173f6b02b7677da","category":"Tech"}
