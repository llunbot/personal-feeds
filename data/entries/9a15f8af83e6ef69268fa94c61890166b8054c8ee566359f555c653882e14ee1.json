We’d even put our neck on the line and say it’s a bike that wouldn’t be seen in the men’s World Tour peloton simply due to the parts used. If that’s intrigued, you then hit that play button.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/video-world-champion-elisa-balsamos-cannondale-supersix-evo/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"9a15f8af83e6ef69268fa94c61890166b8054c8ee566359f555c653882e14ee1","category":"Cycling"}
