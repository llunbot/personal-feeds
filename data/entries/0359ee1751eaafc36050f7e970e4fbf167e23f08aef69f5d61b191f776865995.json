Industry insiders told TrendForce that the new skin-detect sensor may allow the third-generation AirPods to detect water content in the wearer's skin for this purpose.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, Apple's tech specs page indicates that the third-generation AirPods do not support Conversation Boost, a feature designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations. Conversation Boost is only available on the AirPods Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/airpods-pro-conversation-boost/\">following a firmware update</a> earlier this month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nConversation Boost uses the AirPods Pro's beam-forming microphones to boost the volume of a person talking in front of you, making it easier to listen to a face-to-face conversation, and there is also an option to reduce ambient noise.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-announces-third-generation-airpods/\">unveiled the third-generation AirPods</a> on Monday with a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but no active noise cancellation or silicone ear tips. Key features include improved sound quality with Adaptive EQ and spatial audio, longer battery life, a MagSafe charging case, IPX4-rated water and sweat resistance, and more. The third-generation AirPods are available to order now for $179 and will launch on Tuesday, October 26.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/airpods-3-skin-detect-no-conversation-boost/\">AirPods 3 Feature Improved In-Ear Detection, Don't Have Conversation Boost</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-3-feature-improved-in-ear-detection-dont-have-conversation-boost.2318203/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kM63j_8b5PI:-WV45SdxD6U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kM63j_8b5PI:-WV45SdxD6U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kM63j_8b5PI\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0359ee1751eaafc36050f7e970e4fbf167e23f08aef69f5d61b191f776865995","category":"Apple"}
