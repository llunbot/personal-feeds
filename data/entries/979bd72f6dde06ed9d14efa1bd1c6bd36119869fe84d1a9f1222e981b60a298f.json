This is a different form of pinning than pinning an entire thread — it’s just for individual <em>messages</em>, and only messages that are either links or images. I couldn’t figure out what this did until I found this write-up at AppleInsider, which explains the point. When you pin a link or image, you can refer back to it in the profile details for the contact(s) in that thread. That’s the popover you get by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tapping the user avatar in the center of top navigation bar on iOS.</li>\n<li>Clicking the “i”-in-circle Info button on MacOS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Scroll down in that popover and there’s a section for pins, right above the section showing all photos in the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Kind of a weirdly obscure feature. I can see using it, maybe, now that I know it’s there. But I never would have guessed it was there, and couldn’t even figure out what “Pin” meant in this context until I searched the web for an answer.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/pinned-links-and-images-in-messages\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"979bd72f6dde06ed9d14efa1bd1c6bd36119869fe84d1a9f1222e981b60a298f","category":"Tech"}
