I’d like to attribute that to a successful mix of riding time and family time, but there’s always more than enough ‘work’ to keep us busy enough to lose track of the calendar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 helped launch too many new and exciting products to count. Being far enough removed from the pandemic’s start seems to have spurred the release of several big introductions that were on hold during more tumultuous years. Either that has made choosing Editor’s Choice awards easier than in the past, or I’m getting better at choosing the things that bring me the most joy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, the following picks for the 2024 Editor’s Choice awards were obvious standouts, and would be excellent additions to anyone’s gear stable in the new year!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Bike Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Non-work Related: Total Eclipse Adventure</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-28-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"967\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-28-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"elipse tent camping Northface\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-28-Large-jpeg.webp 967w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-28-Large-227x300.webp 227w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-28-Large-91x120.webp 91w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-28-Large-768x1017.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-24-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"807\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-24-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"eclipse viewing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-24-Large-jpeg.webp 807w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-24-Large-189x300.webp 189w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-24-Large-76x120.webp 76w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-24-Large-768x1218.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-29-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-29-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"elispe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-29-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-29-Large-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-29-Large-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-29-Large-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-32-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-32-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"eclipse editor's choice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-32-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-32-Large-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-32-Large-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-32-Large-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-32-Large-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of the product picks were easy to narrow down, the best bike <em>experience</em> is always a tough one. Simply put, we are incredibly fortunate to experience many of the best cycling adventures, usually multiple times per year. But the one that stands out the most to me wasn’t some elaborate press junket in a far-off place. Instead, it happened in (near) my backyard, and involved a rare celestial event with friends and family. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally, I had no plans to go see the total solar eclipse in April. But as the date neared, I decided I should at least try since the path of totality was only 45 minutes away. To my surprise, one of our local MTB trails had availability at their campground two months out, so I booked a spot without any other plans. As the event got closer, everything came together including my family and Tyler and his family joining in the festivities. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-26-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-26-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Shotgun seat editor's choice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-26-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-26-Large-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-26-Large-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-26-Large-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-26-Large-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-27-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-27-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Shotgun seat editor's choice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-27-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-27-Large-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-27-Large-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-27-Large-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-27-Large-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiencing totality with everyone was life-changing, as was my ride with my daughter on the Shotgun Seat during the partial eclipse following. My daughter’s enthusiastic chatter about the eclipse and the ‘blue loop–fruit loop’ trail is something I will never forget. If you have the chance to experience a total solar eclipse with family and friends, don’t sleep on it. And make sure to bring a bike!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Work-Related Experience: Riding to the Sea Otter Classic with Otso</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-22-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-22-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"glamping tent Costanoa\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-22-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-22-Large-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-22-Large-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-22-Large-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-22-Large-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-18-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-18-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Otso ride to Sea Otter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-18-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-18-Large-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-18-Large-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-18-Large-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-18-Large-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-21-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-21-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Otso ride to Sea Otter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-21-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-21-Large-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-21-Large-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-21-Large-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-21-Large-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-20-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-20-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Otso ride to Sea Otter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-20-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-20-Large-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-20-Large-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-20-Large-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-20-Large-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to choose an experience that was purely work-related, it would be riding from San Francisco to Monterey with Otso for the Sea Otter Classic. In what seems like a rite of passage for any Sea Otter veteran, I’ve had the invitation to do this with a few different companies over the years, but the timing has never worked out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, that changed as the lack of pre-show events meant I had enough time to fly into SFO to meet up with the Otso crew and start making our way to Monterey. Originally the plan was to ride from near SFO to the surprisingly posh Costanoa campground, spend the night, and then make the big push into Laguna Seca the following day. I missed the first day of riding after arriving under the weather, but after an incredible night’s sleep in a tent bungalow, I woke up the following day ready for a long ride on an <a

ride was incredible. It ended up being a long day since many of the Otso ambassadors along for the ride were riding mostly loaded with all their bikepacking gear, but that just meant we had plenty of excuses to stop and smell the roses.

So when I heard about the major changes to the bike for the next generation, I had my reservations. I still love the v4, but there is no question that the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ibis-ripley-v5-internal-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">Ibis Ripley v5</a> is a much more modern, and more capable bike that will shine in more terrain. And that’s before you convert it to the Ripmo!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a swap of the fork, shock, and shock clevis &amp; eyelet hardware, you can bump your 130/140mm travel Ripley to a 150/160mm travel Ripmo, and vice versa. I have yet to ride the bike in the Ripmo configuration (coming soon for the full review), so for now, this award is limited to the Ripley. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1404\" height=\"2500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-jpg.webp 1404w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-168x300.webp 168w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-67x120.webp 67w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-768x1368.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-863x1536.webp 863w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-35-1150x2048.webp 1150w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1404\" height=\"2500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-jpg.webp 1404w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-168x300.webp 168w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-67x120.webp 67w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-768x1368.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-863x1536.webp 863w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-45-1150x2048.webp 1150w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to its shapeshifting abilities, the Ripley/Ripmo gets truly useable internal downtube storage with a frame that still fits a large water bottle even on the smaller sizes.

Following the Ripley v5 for MTB, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-pivot-vault-gravel-bike-toolshed/\" target=\"_blank\">Pivot Vault Gen 4</a>. The Vault has evolved quite a bit since its early days as a CX-specific model with the current version less specialized and far more capable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many other carbon gravel bikes out there, the new Vault isn’t hyper-focused on gravel racing, or a super-slack fat-tire dropbar MTB. Rather than zeroing in on the extremes, the Vault strikes a perfect balance as an all-around gravel bike that would be just as comfortable on a long and fast gravel race as it would be for a big bikepacking adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The svelte frame includes a much more discreet Iso-Flex system which genuinely reduces feedback felt through the saddle. The frame also includes internal frame storage, tons of mounting options including full-coverage fenders, multiple cable routing options, and clearance for meaty 700c x 50mm tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s light, it’s efficient, and there are even complete builds starting at $3,999 which is impressive for a Pivot. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Components</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Suspension: Fox Live Valve NEO</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Fox live valve neo editor's choice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-2-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-46-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-47-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The more electronics I accumulate, the less I want to be associated with my bikes – but I have to acknowledge a great product when I use it. The previous Live Valve system would never have been something I wanted on my bikes. It was complicated, heavy, had a ton of wires, and did funky stuff depending on the terrain and riding style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fox-live-valve-neo-fast-wireless-suspension-control-air-coil-shocks/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox Live Valve NEO</a> on the other hand, is a revolution for Fox and suspension control in general. Starting with the installation, NEO is extremely simple and easy to add to your bike. Consisting of just a rear shock and two brake sensors, the system can be used with any front fork and doesn’t require any additional components like power meters, cadence sensors, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of a fork lockout is one of my favorite things about the system – the original Live Valve always required a harsh impact when the locked-out fork first hit something which caused the fork and the rest of the system to open. Now, your fork acts as normal and the opening of the rear shock is so fast and silent it’s hard to even notice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding it on the Ibis Ripley v5 which is already an incredible pedaler, but the NEO shock has made it even better. Instantly I was noticing faster climbs without giving up anything on rough terrain. The shock does seem to make the bike sit up a little taller, and there are so many adjustments in the Fox Bike app that I haven’t tried yet, but so far NEO has absolutely exceeded any expectations. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Brakes: SRAM Maven SLV Brakes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-6-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Maven brake editor's choice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-7-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Maven brake editor's choice\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-8-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I mentioned this in our upcoming podcast, but the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-maven-dh-disc-brake-initial-review/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Maven brakes</a> are the first brakes from SRAM that I’ve wanted to buy with my own money in a long time. They’re that good. According to SRAM, these are the most powerful brakes they’ve made and you can tell. More importantly, despite the earth-halting stopping power, there is plenty of modulation to allow you to control it. After running these on a heavy ebike, there’s no other brake I’d rather have slowing me down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brakes are also based on a mineral oil system which should make them more robust in the long term. These probably offer <em>too much</em> power for a lot of bikes, but if this is a hint of the future of SRAM braking, I’m all for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Dropper Post: WTC Resolve rev2</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Resolve Dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wolf-Tooth-Components-Resolve-Dropper-post-rev2-v2-update-05-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Wolf Tooth Components Resolve Dropper post was already one of my favorites, so an<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-components-resolve-rev2-is-new-worlds-longest-dropper-post-adds-34-9mm-size/\" target=\"_blank\"> improved Resolve rev2</a> version goes straight to the top of the list.

Something like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/reserve-40-44-carbon-grave-racel-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Reserve 40/44 wheelset</a>. There are lighter or possibly more aerodynamic wheels out there, but few combine that with the absolute durability and lifetime warranty of the Reserve wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve beaten on these wheels daily since first mounting them up, and they’ve performed exquisitely without a single issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Tires: WTB Vulpine 45</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Vulpine 45 Resolute 50 Macro XC tires-5\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WTB-Vulpine-45-Resolute-50-Macro-XC-tires-5-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 seemed to be the year for fast 45mm gravel tires, and for me at the top of that list is the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtb-adds-wider-gravel-tires-new-macro-xc-race-tire-vulpine-s-plus-casing-updates/\" target=\"_blank\">WTB Vulpine 45</a>. WTB also introduced the Vulpine S which has a completely smooth center section much like Jordan’s pick of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/jordan-villella-editors-choic-gear-of-the-year-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Hutchinson Caracal</a>. But after riding the Vulpine 45 and Vulpine S back to back, I didn’t notice a huge difference in speed and rolling resistance on pavement, but the difference in grip in slick off-road situations was dramatic (if you ride mostly dry conditions, the Vulpine S is a great choice). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure the Vulpine 45 will wear faster than the ‘S’, but for those who want a fast tire that still grips in most off-road situations, the Vulpine 45 is the clear winner. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Accessories</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Pump: WTC EnCase Pump</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-10-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I very rarely flat (knock on wood). Despite that, I rarely travel without a pump. I don’t really like CO2 and would prefer something that’s going to work multiple times when you need it. The new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtc-encase-bike-pumps-with-tool-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">EnCase pumps from Wolf Tooth Components</a> are excellent, and most importantly, the smallest 40cc pump will fit in your pocket, or in a downtube storage bag like the Cotopaxi bags included in the Ripley v5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means it’s always there when you need it, and you can even stash a tubeless plugger in the end for the complete flat kit package. The smaller pump will take a while to fill a large volume tire, but it’s worth it for me based on how seldom it’s used. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Bike Transport: Blivet Tindr Tire Covers</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1748\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-297x208.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-1536x1074.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-120x84.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-768x537.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-48-2048x1432.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fat bikes pose some interesting transportation challenges, particularly if you ride when it’s icy. I have plenty of bike racks that can carry a fat bike, but during the winter the last place I want my bike to be is getting sprayed with a salt bath on the back of my car. So I usually put my bikes inside my car during the winter (thank you Honda Element). But studded tires make that a delicate affair, usually requiring a few moving blankets and careful placement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was until I found out about Blivet Sports and their <a href=\"https://blivetsports.com/collections/equipements/products/tindr-tire-cover?variant=35010422243462\" target=\"_blank\">Tindr tire covers</a>. These reinforced 600-denier polyester covers wrap around the tire and prevent the studs from digging into your car or yourself. They fit 26″ x 4 to 4.8″ or 27.5 x 3.8 – 4.5″ tires, and sell for $50 per set. Well worth it in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blivet also has some incredible winter boots that were a contender for an Editor’s Choice award, but I simply haven’t had enough time on them in cold temperatures yet. Check back next year as the Blivet Quilo FLT boots are already seriously impressive. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Recovery Product: KT Health Ice Sleeve</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1.jpg\" alt=\"KT Health Activate and recover cream ice sleeves-4\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KT-Health-Activate-and-recover-cream-ice-sleeves-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t get to be a middle-aged mountain biker without some injuries along the way. This year I was introduced to<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kt-tape-ice-products-activate-recover-cream-ice-sleeeve-prepare-perform-recover/\"> KT Health’s new line of products</a> which included their amazing Ice Sleeve. It’s exactly what it sounds like, but better than you would expect. The soft microfiber sleeve stays flexible when cold, and the compressive sleeve keeps it in place where you need cooling therapy. It will never freeze solid, will never leak even if punctured, and comes in multiple sizes to use on legs, arms, and more (I used it flat on a broken rib). These are absolutely worth the $39.99 price tag, and will help shorten injury duration and get you back in the saddle faster. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Bike Adjacent: Engel UltraLite Hard Cooler</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-50-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-49-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-51-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-52-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally we get a chance to test gear that I’d call bike adjacent. The Engel UltraLite Hard Cooler is one such example. What caught my attention was that the 60 qt UltraLite was lighter than my Yeti Tundra 50 in spite of being 10 qt bigger capacity. While the Engel ended up being nearly 2lbs heavier than claimed (23.2 lbs), it’s still lighter than the Tundra 50 (25.8 lbs) and offers more capacity and easier-to-operate latches. It also includes a divider and upper dry goods basket, all while coming in at $130 cheaper than a comparable Yeti Tundra 65. Ice-keeping ability seems to be on par with the Yeti, and so far, it’s been just as durable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Clothing</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Cold Weather Clothing: Ornot Grid Thermal Jersey &amp; Thermal Cargo Bib Tight</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-54-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1019\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-54-1536x1019.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-54-1536x1019.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-54-297x197.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-54-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-54-768x510.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-54-2048x1359.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-55-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"941\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-55-1536x941.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-55-1536x941.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-55-297x182.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-55-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-55-768x470.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-55-2048x1254.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been eyeing Ornot clothing for a while now, and I finally got to try some out for myself – I was not disappointed.

It’s clear that Ornot knows how to make clothing for varying conditions, but more impressive is the fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Warm Weather Clothing: Castelli Espresso Shorts and Bibs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-56-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden a lot of different road and gravel kit over the years, and the new Castelli Espresso collection stands out as one of my favorites. Unlike Castelli kit in the past that I recall, the Espresso collection isn’t so small that you have to size up multiple sizes. The medium fit me very well with arm and leg length which was nearly perfect. The feel of the Doppio fabric and Progetto X2 Air chamois makes for all-day comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice Footwear: Shimano S-Phyre XC903 MTB Shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7.jpg\" alt=\"Shimano XC903 s-phyre xc race mtb shoes review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shimano-XC903-s-phyre-xc-race-mtb-shoes-review-actual-weight-7-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve long prioritized comfort over shoe performance, which usually means I’m not riding XC race shoes. The new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-s-phyre-xc903-mtb-shoes-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano S-Phyre XC903</a> shoes are so comfortable that you don’t have to eschew performance for shoe comfort. They <em>should</em> be extra comfortable for the $450 price tag, but if you’re going to go all out on your footwear, these are worth a look. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Parting Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bye from Sea Otter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BikeRumor-Editors-Choice-Zach-Overholt-2024-57-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Parting shot from Sea Otter 2024, cameo by Rob Warner. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll leave you with a heartfelt thanks to all of our readers and everyone we’ve had the privilege of working with in 2024 and beyond. BikeRumor is and always will be a labor of love for all of us behind the scenes, and the best part of the job is actually getting out and riding with friends and family, old and new. I wish everyone a happy holiday and a happy new year – catch you all in 2025!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Each of these products was entirely chosen purely on their technical merits, by me personally, and for the reasons described above. More great products passed through my hands in 2024. Under no circumstances were any of my picks, paid for by their producers. Nor was any preference or favor given to the brand or advertiser. My selections are mostly (but not exclusively) limited to products I’ve actually spent time riding/testing in person. So a brand’s willingness to invite Bikerumor to join a launch event, or to provide product samples can make it more likely that we will have considered their products, if only because we can share our real, firsthand experiences.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-2024-zachs-gear-of-the-year/\">BikeRumor Editor’s Choice 2024 – Zach’s Gear of the Year</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8bab71393b6efa28f8d44ea61a56a632b536fb5c889f30925c8557ebd82d8ecb","category":"Cycling"}
