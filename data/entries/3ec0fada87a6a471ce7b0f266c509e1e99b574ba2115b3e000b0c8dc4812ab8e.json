He lay in wait, a silent assassin lurking in the shadows, barely raising his head above the parapet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It ultimately kept him out of trouble, and it won him a maiden Giro d’Italia title, a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-trophies-in-pro-cycling\">Trofeo Senza Fine</a> for the mantlepiece and a <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia rosa</a></em> to hang on the wall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Quiet beginnings</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/GettyImages-2214362396-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first week, Yates’s name barely came up in discussions. He kept to himself, let the race unfold and rode home within the main bunch, his best finish an 11th place in Tagliacozzo. The second week kicked off with an individual time-trial and his respectable time on the wet roads saw him creep towards the podium. He wasn’t quite on the third step yet, but one foot was reaching out. Loitering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In keeping with that quiet start his ascent up the standings was not through a daring attack but instead simply a perfect navigation from Treviso to Gorizia on a day that Sean Kelly mused over the potential for it to be ‘a dull one’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A slide out over white lines on Stage 14 caused several riders to come down. Giulio Ciccone lost 16 minutes. Antonio Tiberi fell from the podium. Grand Tour dreams suddenly capitulated far away from the mountains. There is an element of luck that goes hand in hand with Grand Tour success and this time it was on Yates’s side. He avoided the spills that befell his rivals to continue his rise up the standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only noticeable setback from here would barely form a dint in the end. Stage 17 included the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mortirolo-cycling\"> Mortirolo</a>. Richard Carapaz and Isaac del Toro engaged in a duel on the mountain and broke clear to contest the stage win alongside the day’s remaining breakaway survivor Romain Bardet. Yates rolled over the line in fourth. He had been gapped and he lost out on any bonus seconds. His only mistake. Del Toro looked in control. The chances were passing by, the last grains of sand slipping through the hourglass.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'join us and discover the world's best places to ride, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Facing an old enemy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-962380648-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly appreciate the grand climax of the 2025 Giro d’Italia, we must revisit the 2018 edition of the race. Yates, then adorned in the pink threads of general classification leadership, was on the cusp of a potential first Grand Tour victory. At the start of Stage 19, a 185km day to Bardonecchia, he held a 28sec advantage over Tom Doumoulin and 2min 43sec over Domenico Pozzovivo. The route took riders over the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\">Colle delle Finestre</a> – the highest point of the race – and finished on Monte Jafferau (7km, 9%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates imploded. He wasn’t slipping backwards, he was freefalling. The climb was relentless. Then the knockout blow came. Not from Dumoulin, but Chris Froome. Fourth in the standings and over three minutes down, Froome launched a devastating 80km solo attack that smashed the race to pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That day Yates lost almost 40 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giro over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward seven years and Yates was forced to revisit the site of his heartbreak, except this time not protecting a lead but trying to take one. This suited him more, standing in the entrance of a last-chance saloon ready to shoot. He worked his way up to Del Toro and Carapaz, the three men on the podium setting up a battle for the ages. Del Toro in pink, in uncharted waters. Carapaz in second overall, hunting for his second Giro title. Yates in third, nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first, second and third attacks came to nothing, he was reeled back in by Carapaz and Del Toro gradually worked his way back. It was the fourth that stuck, launching from the back of the group and riding clear. It was a long shot, still 13 punishing kilometres left of the climb. But he had Wout van Aert up ahead, ready to launch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything fell into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217959035.webp 1024w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No reaction came from behind. Still nothing when Derek Gee joined. Carapaz knew Del Toro would eventually have to push on if he wanted to defend pink. Likewise Del Toro knew Carapaz would have to attack for any shot at winning. Carapaz tried and failed to shake off the Mexican off his wheel. Del Toro wouldn’t – maybe couldn’t – launch the killer explosive blow needed to ensure victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile Yates rode on, steady and undisturbed, into the virtual lead. He crested the summit and connected with Van Aert. The advantage grew. Two minutes swelled into three, three into four. Behind, the descent was their undoing. Del Toro turned to Carapaz; Carapaz shook his head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was all over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Yates crossed the line in Sestriere, he had blown his rivals out of the water. He had reclaimed the mountain that punished him so severely in the past. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had won the Giro d’Italia with just the processional day in Rome remaining. It was a stage that left many reeling. The killer blow from Yates, the indecisiveness behind. Riding to win vs not riding at all. Leaving it all on the road and seeing what sticks, but, mostly importantly, being prepared to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates claimed victory in the Giro d’Italia by 3min 56sec over Del Toro.

The 21-year-old from Mexico topped the standings for almost two weeks before being usurped by Yates. While he didn’t play his cards right on the penultimate stage – whether it be team instructions, inability to attack or uncertainty in the new position he found himself in – there can be much to learn from the three weeks that will only benefit him further in his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is a future Grand Tour winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mads Pedersen is worth his weight in gold</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MVP of the race? Lidl-Trek’s Swiss army knife Mads Pedersen. He immediately impressed by winning the opening stage in Albania and wore the first <em>maglia rosa</em>. When he wasn’t racking up four of the six stage victories for the squad, he was pulling on the front for Giulio Ciccone or even blasting apart the breakaway on the Finestre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lidl-Trek signed him up for a lifetime contract last month. He’s already proving them right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe came to life without Primož Roglič</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps controversial, but it was enthralling to watch Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe adjust to a Grand Tour without Primož Roglič. Nico Denz immediately went on the offensive, winning the second stage on offer after their team leader’s abandonment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Giulio Pellizzari, he really impressed. His third place on a mountainous Stage 16 catapulted him into the top ten. He kept grinding, finishing in fifth the next day and ending the race sixth overall, winning the Italian youth classification. He’s another top talent and he’s only 21 years old.
