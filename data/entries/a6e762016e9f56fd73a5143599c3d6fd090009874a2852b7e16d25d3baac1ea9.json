Arguably the climb’s most (in)famous patron was Lance Armstrong. It was his use of the climb for training, combined with his relationship with Trek, that prompted the genesis of the bike. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/scott-addict-history\">The complete history of the Scott Addict</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-history-giant-tcr\">The complete history of the Giant TCR</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The Texan had won the first few of his Tours de France aboard various versions of Trek’s 5000-series bikes but, by introducing an approach that Trek still employs today, the brand used feedback from its sponsored pros to develop a successor, and the Madone was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Madone was properly introduced in 2003 and represented a big change over the 5000-series bikes, as it was our first to consider aerodynamics,’ says Roessingh. ‘Although all that really amounted to was a fin on the seat tube, which seems quaint these days.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trek tasted success immediately with the Madone when Armstrong won the 2003 Tour using it. While that victory has since been struck from the record books, such a performance still proved that Trek was onto something. That said, in 2007 it gave the Madone a complete revamp. The horizontal top tube was replaced by a sloping top tube in the same vein as the compact Giant TCR, which along with other design innovations saw the new Madone drop 250g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our design team would say the second-generation Madone was an engineering marvel,’ says Roessingh. ‘It was the first Trek to use a tapered head tube and the BB90 bottom bracket standard, and all bearing bores in the frameset were moulded carbon surfaces rather than bonded-in aluminium ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This Madone also pioneered our seatmast design, which we still use today. Integrating the seatpost makes the frame better structurally, but by using a mast we retained the adjustability of a conventional seatpost, in contrast to other designs at that time.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Madone bike history\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Tapestry / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Fittingly, Trek introduced its Project One custom programme during this Madone’s life cycle, where bikes were built to order and users could spec custom paint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Even today, most of our Madones are sold through Project One,’ says Roessingh. ‘Their graphic design is as much a part of their story as their performance features.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Evolution then revolution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to the previous update, 2009’s third-generation Madone was a little more iterative. Further advancements in Trek’s OCLV (optimum compaction low void) carbon fibre fabrication technique produced an 890g frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The main goal was to optimise 2007’s design,’ says Roessingh. ‘The bike used many of the same features but was more structurally efficient thanks to a huge amount of FEA [finite element analysis]. Race bikes at this time had to be light and stiff above all else. Internally, this is one of our favourite Madones because it was the inspiration for what would become the Émonda a few years later.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an excellent illustration of the capriciousness of bike tech trends, three years later the Madone had come full circle, as aerodynamics were back in vogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘By 2012 we had this super-light and stiff bike, but we wanted to reintroduce aerodynamic efficiency so it could be fast too,’ says Roessingh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The fourth generation brought in kamm-tail tube sections and a rear brake mounted under the bottom bracket. This Madone was the first bike in the industry to use direct-mount brakes. We worked in partnership with Shimano to develop the new standard, which other brands then adopted.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trek says Madone number four was 25 watts more efficient than the previous bike at 40kmh, despite it still retaining somewhat of an all-rounder focus. However, after officially launching the lightweight Émonda and splitting its race offering into two options, Trek was freed to pursue a more singular focus when it came to designing the fifth generation of the Madone.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The most radical change came in 2015. We committed to aerodynamics and went all-in on integration,’ says Roessingh. ‘It was the first bike we’d done that had fully hidden cables. We even designed our own brakes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Madone also included a version of IsoSpeed to improve compliance: ‘One of the reasons we hadn’t fully stepped into the aero bike realm before 2015 was that other aero bikes rode like crap,’ says Roessingh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trek’s IsoSpeed system has been deployed on the Domane endurance bike since 2012, and works by effectively decoupling the seat tube from the top tube, allowing it to flex along its entire length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For the Madone, though, we made a tube-in-tube version,’ says Roessingh. ‘We had a skinny internal seat tube for 20mm of compliance at the saddle, and the external seat tube connected to the rest of the frame to essentially provide a fairing for the internal structure, although we didn’t tell the UCI that’s what it was.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>If the bike fits</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Madone bike history\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/trek-madone-bike-history-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Tapestry / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The next Madone in 2018 was similar in nature to the move from second to third – refining a bold design. Disc brakes arrived, as did adjustability: the IsoSpeed device became tunable and the one-piece cockpit became separate bars and stem – an aero bike isn’t very fast if the rider doesn’t fit comfortably onto it. That Madone was the predecessor to the one being raced today, which was introduced in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Maybe more so than others, the latest Madone was the direct result of us going to our teams and saying, “How can we make it better?”’ says Roessingh. ‘The feedback was to keep as much as we can, but make it lighter.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just as it had been more than ten years ago, weight was again a key driver, although that shift in focus had to be reincorporated alongside the gains made previously in stiffness, aerodynamics and comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That meant going back to a one-piece cockpit, but one with altered ergonomics and plenty of options so as not to hinder fit, plus replacing IsoSpeed with IsoFlow,’ says Roessingh. Crudely speaking, IsoFlow is a hole just under the seat tube cluster. It creates a cantilevered seatpost, recreating IsoSpeed’s flex to a degree despite being much simpler and lighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘IsoFlow helps aerodynamics too by funnelling air into the low-pressure wake behind the rider,’ says Roessingh. ‘The switch to IsoFlow and a one-piece cockpit helped us save 300g over the old Madone module. It’s always really telling – we watch our pro riders’ bias when we launch a new Émonda or Madone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There was an Émonda bias prior to this one, but now a lot more riders are on the Madone a lot more frequently. To us, at least, that’s a clear indicator that after all this time the Madone recipe is still pretty damn successful.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek Madone timeline…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Madone’s best
