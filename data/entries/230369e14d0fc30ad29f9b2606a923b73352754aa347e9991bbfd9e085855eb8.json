{"title":"Burger King Botched the Curling on an Apostrophe in a TV Commercial and I Am Very Much Here to Shit on Them for Doing So","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/08/burger-king-apostrophe/","date":1696894677000,"content":"\n<p>John Kelly, writing for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The ad was for a Whopper Jr. promotion. The conceit was that you \ncould get two of the baby burgers for a mere $5: one for you and \none for a friend. But — spoiler alert! — you’d probably want to \nconsume the pair yourself. Or, as the text on the screen put it: </p>\n\n<p>JK YOU <br />\nATE ‘EM <br />\nBOTH</p>\n\n<p>I grabbed my remote, rewound, paused and took a photo. This was \nthe Zapruder film to me, even if the JK stood for “Just kidding,” \nnot “John Kelly.” </p>\n\n<p>This must not stand, or — to keep with the theme — it \nmustn’t stand. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sort of mistake drives me nuts, and I spot such wrongly-curled apostrophes instantly. To me it’s as glaring a mistake as a misspelled word. So god bless Kelly for griping about it in a column in The Washington Post. (I’d argue that perhaps it’s correct for Burger King to use the wrong apostrophe, as a signifier of the care with which they prepare their food.)</p>\n\n<p>But Kelly doesn’t mention the obvious explanation for how this happens: automatic smart quote algorithms that aren’t smart enough, in the hands of ignorant designers who don’t have an eye for typography. If you type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>'em' dashes and 'en' dashes\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>you want the apostrophe before <em>em</em> to be an opening single quote, the one shaped like a 6 in most typefaces. But if you type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>screw 'em\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>you want the apostrophe preceding the <em>em</em> to be a closing single quote, the one shaped like a 9. The various “smart quotes” algorithms you get while typing aren’t smart enough to make this contextual distinction — even <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/\">very good ones</a> — so you need to do it by hand. Here’s how to type them manually:</p>\n\n<p></p><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th></th>\n  <th>Mac</th>\n  <th>Windows</th>\n  <th>Linux</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td>Open single quote: ‘</td>\n  <td>Option-]</td>\n  <td>Alt-0-1-4-5</td>\n  <td><em>Use ASCII</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Close single quote: ’</td>\n  <td>Shift-Option-]</td>\n  <td>Alt-0-1-4-6</td>\n  <td><em>Use ASCII</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Open double quote: “</td>\n  <td>Option-[</td>\n  <td>Alt-0-1-4-7</td>\n  <td>✊🍆</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Close double quote: ”</td>\n  <td>Shift-Option-[</td>\n  <td>Alt-0-1-4-8</td>\n  <td>Shift-✊🍆</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><p></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/burger-king-apostrophe\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"230369e14d0fc30ad29f9b2606a923b73352754aa347e9991bbfd9e085855eb8","category":"Tech"}
