We don’t want to hang bikes from the wall in this room in our house, so floor stands are the only option. The bike stands I ordered from Bailey at Sincere Cycles did the trick for the above-pictured space.  Sort of, anyway. They’re big, bulky, and tend to move when you’re loading the bikes in. But they were around $50 a piece for three, totaling $150. Granted, they’re not as sleek as the Toaster and aren’t made in the USA, nor do they pack down (which is a necessity for when we have guests staying over), but they got the job done.</p>\n<p>If you are crafty, you could make something similar out of plywood with a table saw, a router, and some clever tinkering with cabinet hardware. It wouldn’t be as light as the Toaster, nor would it be as slick, but it would work.</p>\n<p>Yet, if you want a simple, mobile bike rack for your bikes, I can’t think of a better solution on the market right now. Or if you like to car camp or travel in a van or RV and don’t want to lean your bikes against your car, well, the Toaster works for that as well.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-8.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-15.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Why is It So Expensive?</h3>\n<p>A 4′ x 8′ sheet of 1/8″ thick US-made recycled aluminum costs around $300-$400 these days. You could make two Toasters from that 4′ x 8′ sheet, plus the cost to laser cut, bend, drill, powder coat, and assemble with all the necessary hardware. Of course, mass production creates better margins, etc.</p>\n<p>Doing all this in the USA provides jobs for Americans and keeps fabrication industries alive. There’s nothing political about this breakdown, but if you wonder why US-made things are expensive, start looking at what goes into making better, fewer things while adhering to environmental and worker safety regulations.</p>\n<p>Making “stuff” in America is neither affordable nor profitable compared to overseas manufacturing. I’d be surprised if the AhHa designers make a 30% margin on the Toaster.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Now, the question: would I buy one? As I type this answer, acknowledging the expensive bikes it’s holding, it feels expensive, even considering the material/labor estimate above. Perhaps this is because the Toaster is a luxury item that replaced a few cheap, made-in-China stands that got the job done but weren’t all that easy on the eyes nor as practical for someone with limited space and too many bikes.</p>\n<p>However, if you value well-designed, practical, US-made “things,” then you probably don’t think the Toaster is all that expensive. We spent around the same amount of money on some of our made-in-the-USA lawn furniture, so I guess it’s all a matter of perspective. But I’m not going to lie here. I really dig this and think it’s worth it.</p>\n<p><em>Sometimes, products like the Toaster blow up on Kickstarter, so it’ll be interesting to see where this goes for AhHa.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/AhHaToasterReview-17.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>The Toaster presents an interesting conundrum as someone who supports US production as much as possible in his cycling and non-cycling purchases. It is a space-conscious bike storage solution in places where wall hooks or ceiling suspensions are not possible. It does the same job as prolific, cheap, made-in-China bike stands (that don’t fold away neatly). All while teetering on a pricepoint–$429 ($389 Kickstarter Backer pricing)–that is deserved based on its US-made, all-metal construction but is still clearly a luxury spend.</p>\n<p>Yet, it is compact and folds flat to be stowed under a daybed, couch, or in the trunk of a car or road trip van. Your bikes are secure in the stand, and no natural force could compel them or the stand to fall over when used outdoors. It looks great and is appropriate in a guest bedroom or home office.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightweight at 14lbs</li>\n<li>Folds flat and tucks away</li>\n<li>Secure at holding bikes</li>\n<li>Stable and solid construction</li>\n<li>US-made from US-made materials</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Roll on over to the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ahhabike/ahha-toaster\" target=\"_blank\">Toaster Kickstarter</a> to see more.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ahha-toaster-portable-bike-rack-review/\">AhHa Toaster Portable Indoor/Outdoor Bike Rack Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d61287773987c3acc54d7d9a02ed917795a1934f12f2b2b94f9ed10f813ef3db","category":"Cycling"}
