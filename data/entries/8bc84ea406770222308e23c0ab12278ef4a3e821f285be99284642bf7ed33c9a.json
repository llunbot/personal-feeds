Many of them focus on radically new technologies for heating and compressing plasmas, or fusing unusual combinations of isotopes. These technologies are often difficult to evaluateâ€”they can clearly generate hot plasmas, but it's tough to determine whether they can get hot enough, often enough to produce usable amounts of power.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum are a handful of companies that are trying to commercialize designs that have been extensively studied in the academic world. And there have been some interesting signs of progress here. Recently, Commonwealth Fusion, which is building a demonstration tokamak in Massachussets, started construction of the cooling system that will keep its magnets superconducting. And two companies that are hoping to build a stellarator did some important validation of their concepts.</p>\n<h2>Doing donuts</h2>\n<p>A tokamak is a donut-shaped fusion chamber that relies on intense magnetic fields to compress and control the plasma within it. A number of tokamaks have been built over the years, but the big one that is expected to produce more energy than required to run it, <a href=\"https://www.iter.org/\">ITER</a>, has faced many delays and now isn't expected to achieve its potential <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/iters-timeline-for-fusion-stretched-out-even-further/\">until the 2040s</a>. Back in 2015, however, some physicists calculated that high-temperature superconductors would allow ITER-style performance in a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/small-modular-nuke-plant-proposed-this-time-for-fusion/\">far smaller and easier-to-build</a> package.
