The new kind of drive technology uses lasers to heat disk platters during writing, making it possible to store more data on a disk without increasing its physical size.</p>\n<p>But there's still a bit more capacity to be wrung out of older and more-proven recording technologies like perpendicular (or conventional) magnetic recording (PMR/CMR, often used interchangeably) and shingled magnetic recording (SMR); Western Digital announced this week that it's preparing to sample huge 28TB hard drives based on those technologies, a little over a year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/western-digital-announces-26tb-hard-drives-and-15tb-server-ssds/\">after announcing its first 26TB model</a>.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/western-digital-readies-28tb-hdd\">Tom's Hardware</a>, WD uses energy-assisted perpendicular magnetic recording (ePMR) to fit up to 24TB of data on a single drive. SMR allows magnetic tracks to overlap slightly (like the shingles on a roof), allowing slightly more data to fit onto the same physical platters at the expense of write performanceâ€”this boosts the capacity of these drives to 28TB.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958232#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958232&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c242361b618bb51283af1c18946c2e57ef7e69610c2f4caa8d34c5474ae76347","category":"Tech"}
