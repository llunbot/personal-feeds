It's designed to help users find content and learn about new features, so it includes tools for downloading apps and visionOS content, a tips page, and a My Vision Pro section for setting up Personalized Spatial Audio and getting information like headset serial number.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/vision-pro-app-iphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nGuest setup can now be managed on an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ linked to a Vision Pro, making it easier for Vision Pro owners to let others test their headset. There are controls for limiting what apps a guest is able to use, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> mode for guiding the guest through Vision Pro experiences. When a guest user puts on the Vision Pro, a prompt to enable Guest Mode will appear on the headset owner's device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro app isn't in this beta, but it will be coming in a later iOS 18.4 beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Emojis</h2>\r<br />\nThere are no new emoji in the current beta, but iOS 18.4 code confirms a future beta will add new characters.
