His Yankees won four\nWorld Series in five years and nearly made it five in six. In the\nmiddle of all the winning in the late ‘90s for the Yankees of Joe\nTorre — the man Jeter calls “Mister Torre” — I was with Jeter\none day at his locker at the old Yankee Stadium.</p>\n\n<p>The Yankees were getting ready for another October, and I said to\nhim, “You know, this isn’t going to last forever.”</p>\n\n<p>He looked up at me and quietly said, “Why not?”</p>\n\n<p>This was before he made The Flip to get Jeremy Giambi at the plate\nin Oakland to save a Yankees season, and before he went 5-for-5 on\nthe day he got to 3,000 hits with a home run off David Price. But\nJeter was already the player that kids wanted to be. There were\nother great Yankees at that time. Still: No. 2 was the one.</p>\n\n<p>And the moment I will always remember best for Jeter, as big and\nimportant and memorable <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/derek-jeter-most-memorable-moments\">as any he ever had</a> and the old\nStadium ever had, came at the end of Game 4 of the 2001 World\nSeries, in the middle of three extraordinary nights in the shadow\nof 9/11, three nights when the Yankees made a wounded city cheer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Worth it just for the video clip with Michael Kay’s call: “See ya! See ya! See ya!” Gets you right there.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/08/mr-november\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9488e4fc1da70ba08d3871156159ecd925071f17f3ff5bb71613603339e363a1","category":"Tech"}
