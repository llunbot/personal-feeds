Now the report is here, and oh boy, is it a disaster. Profits are officially down a stunning 95 percent for Q1 2023. The company made 14.12 trillion Korean won in profit ($10.7 billion) for Q1 2022, and this year it's just 640 billion won ($478.55 million). These are Samsung's lowest profits since 2009, basically back when the modern smartphone market was still materializing.</p>\n<p>Samsung is well-known for its smartphones, TVs, and appliances, but most of the company's business is components like chips and displays. <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20220913VL206/foundry-samsung.html\">In 2022</a> the memory division accounted for 55 percent of profits, mobile was 22 percent, and displays were 11 percent. That company-leading memory division is exactly what tanked this quarter, posting a <em>loss</em> of 4.58 trillion Korean won ($3.4 billion), compared to a profit of 8.45 trillion won ($6.3 billion) this quarter last year.</p>\n<p>Back when memory sales were booming at the height of the pandemic, Samsung chose to stockpile chips to fend off a possible shortage. Now sales are down, and while some memory vendors <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-to-cut-production-of-memory-chips-11668610378\">saw this coming</a> and cut production, Samsung didn't, and now it's facing a glut of unsold chips and lower prices. Samsung announced it would finally cut production at the beginning of April, when it set off alarm bells about this earnings report.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934941#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934941&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a1ced5076bfaa5b1d657bba2d3b2837f2bc97e34b5fbb97c96fb29b1da271e6","category":"Tech"}
