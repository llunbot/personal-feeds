These costs help pay universities and research centers to provide the environment and resources all their researchers need to get research done. Previously, these had been set through negotiations with the university and audits of the spending. These averaged roughly 30 percent of the value of the grant itself and would frequently exceed 50 percent.</p>\n<p>The NIH announcement set the rate at 15 percent for every campus. The new rate would start today and apply retroactively to existing grants, meaning most research universities are currently finding themselves facing catastrophic budget shortfalls.</p>\n<p>Today, a coalition of 22 states <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.280590/gov.uscourts.mad.280590.1.0.pdf\">filed a suit</a> that seeks to block the new policy, alleging it violated both a long-standing law and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(legislation)\">budget rider</a> that Congress had passed in response to a 2017 attempt by Trump to drastically cut indirect costs. The suit seeks to prevent the new policy or its equivalent from being applied to the research centers located in the states that have joined the suit, essentially leaving red states to suffer the consequences of the funding cut.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b5edfcbf69a5e000df9305353b226f77fa97c57736dca1c7b6d7d9f60ccfb1d","category":"Tech"}
