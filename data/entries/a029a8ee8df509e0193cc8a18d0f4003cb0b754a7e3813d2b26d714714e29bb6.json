Last year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/iphone-16-pro-max-charging-test/\"><em>ChargerLAB</em></a> found that the iPhone 16 Pro models achieved maximum sustained charging speeds of around 30W. <em><a href=\"https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-battery-and-charging_id159630\">PhoneArena</a></em> saw similar results with the standard iPhone 16, although under heavy load the phones would start charging at 38W. We'll have to wait for testing in the wild to confirm the iPhone 16e wattage figure given in the Chinese regulatory filing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu has said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all support up to 35W wired charging speeds. He did not  reveal wireless MagSafe charging speeds for any iPhone 17 models. iPhone 16 models can charge at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-25w-magsafe-charging/\">up to 25W with MagSafe</a>, a feature that the iPhone 16e lacks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is opening pre-orders for the iPhone 16e today at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time, with the $599 device officially launching on Friday, February 28.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mysmartprice-com/\">MySmartPrice</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-usb-c-fast-charging-29w/\">iPhone 16e Supports USB-C Fast Charging up to 29W, Based on Chinese Regulatory Filing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-supports-usb-c-fast-charging-up-to-29w-based-on-chinese-regulatory-filing.2449868/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a029a8ee8df509e0193cc8a18d0f4003cb0b754a7e3813d2b26d714714e29bb6","category":"Apple"}
