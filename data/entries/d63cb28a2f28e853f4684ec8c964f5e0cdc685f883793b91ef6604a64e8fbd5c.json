But it was also faster than the RTX 3080 Ti, 3090, and 3090 Ti. One of the good things about a new graphics card generation is that the new cards bring the last generation's inaccessibly expensive high-end performance down to cards that more people can actually afford.</p>\n<p><span>That's not the case with the new $999 RTX 5080, which beats <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-review-all-you-need-to-know-is-that-its-cheaper-than-a-4080/\" target=\"_blank\">the previous-generation RTX 4080 Super</a> by a little bit and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/\" target=\"_blank\">older RTX 4080</a> by a slightly larger bit but doesn't come close to beating or even replicating the performance of the outgoing 4090.</span></p>\n<p>Nvidia points to its new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation technology as a mitigating factor here, leaning on its AI-generated frames to close the gap that the 5080's raw rendering performance can't close on its own. And sure, it's nice that this card <em>can</em> do that. On paper, the 5080 is also technically a good value compared to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/review-nvidias-geforce-rtx-5090-is-the-first-gpu-that-can-beat-the-rtx-4090/\">the flagship RTX 5090</a>—between 60 and 75 percent of the performance for half the price (though talking about the MSRP of any of these cards at launch is strictly theoretical, given <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-finally-admits-looming-rtx-50-series-gpu-shortage-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-stockouts-may-happen\">allegedly short supply</a> and the demand from both actual buyers and scalpers looking to make a buck).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review-more-like-a-4080-super-super/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review-more-like-a-4080-super-super/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d63cb28a2f28e853f4684ec8c964f5e0cdc685f883793b91ef6604a64e8fbd5c","category":"Tech"}
