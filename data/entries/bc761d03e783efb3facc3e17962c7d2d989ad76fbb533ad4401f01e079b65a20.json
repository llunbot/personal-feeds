Ignore the flaking (possible) lead paint, asbestos, and mold. Instead, appreciate the tile work, stained glass, and decades of patina.</p>\n<p>With infinite colors, textures, and interestingness, I found myself getting lost in the details of the venue as much as the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/beautiful-bicycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Beautiful Bicycles</a> on display.

Leicester’s Alfano Frameworks brought his personal time trail bike to Bespoked UK this year. The bike was literally fresh from the painter and assembled minutes before the showcase opened to builders for setup last Thursday.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alfana-Razzle-Dazzle-TT-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alfana-Razzle-Dazzle-TT-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alfana-Razzle-Dazzle-TT-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alfana-Razzle-Dazzle-TT-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Pete Alfano explained to me the relevance of British time trials as I carefully balanced the bike on my display stand. It seems British “open” road racing was banned in the 1890s due to someone complaining, resulting in a growth in time trial races. As a method for evading police, racers could ride in a group and allow each individual to wear all-black while riding the course to avoid detection from the authorities.</p>\n<p>As such, this is Pete’s personal bike; he’s been a lifelong fan of time trial racing and decided it was time to build himself a new bike. The all-steel 10.8 kilo bike features steel fairings and a stunning “Razzle Dazzle” warship-inspired paint, laid down by Chroma Paintworks. This bike won best paint at the show.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alfanoframeworks/\" target=\"_blank\">@AlfanoFrameworks</a></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-12.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-12.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-15.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-15.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-44.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-44.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-44.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Clandestine-Pinion-Touring-Bike-44.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.clandestine.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Clandestine Pinion Touring Bike</a></h3>\n<p>You had me at olive drab.

All of these alone would make for a very tasteful machine, but it’s the dichotomy of these timeless details contrasted with the Pinion gearbox that made this bike a show-stopper.</p>\n<p>In fact, the only thing more wonderful than this bike is the human who built it.

I was served James’ development of the Galago MX V2 bike via my Instagram explore page and was immediately hooked. The use of 3D sintered components from 316L stainless is one thing but the whole modus operandi of Creature Cycles was very appealing for a number of reasons. First, I love UK steel full-suspension bikes. But Creature has gone a few steps further than others in the space. Tyler designed the bike to pivot on poly bushings, similar to what you’d find in a leaf spring shackle in a 4×4 or pickup truck. After playing around with all sorts of bearing types, he decided to use bushings for this version of the Galago. Second, his stem is a work of art in itself. The buttressing and stainless steel finish is reminiscent of an ancient artifact. Third, I can’t get enough of the gusset… and that paint!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-38.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>All these are obvious details but upon further inspection, you’ll notice the diamond-shaped pivot points, counter-sunk into the linkage parts. These are tapered – like a square tapered crank spindle – resulting in a press-fit connection that is secure, even if you remove the bolts. Utilizing MX, or mixed wheel sizes, the Galago has a trail/enduro geometry and just looks like it wants to grip and plop down the trail thanks to the mono linkage design.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-17.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-17.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-30.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-30.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-30.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Creature-Mullet-Mono-Pivot-Steel-Full-Suspension-30.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>James learned to fillet at the Bicycle Academy but taught himself how to TIG weld.

This year, he brought this stunning road bike. He learned how to fillet, braze, and build bikes from Butterfield Bicycles, a tiny shop in Manchester, and has been building for four years. While comparatively a short amount of time, Pete hasn’t minced his figurative words with this bike, which exhibits a number of clever and unique details.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Medusa-Disc-Road-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Medusa-Disc-Road-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Medusa-Disc-Road-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Medusa-Disc-Road-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A bilam seat cluster is coupled with a triple triangle seat stay that is sleeved around the top tube to add some stiffness to the bike. For more bottom bracket stiffness, he’s used a double chainstay, with the top stay bent and fillet brazed to the lower stay. The bike was painted by Pete in his shop and features intricately adorned oak leaves, as well as the Medusa text. Pete’s also a bit of a brush artist himself, painting his Medusa sign hanging in his booth.</p>\n<p>If there is one bike that reflects the Victoria Baths through ornate beauty, it’s this Medusa road. Well done, Pete.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/medusa.cycles/\" target=\"_blank\">@MedusaCycles</a></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Singular-Cycles-Track-Bike-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://singularcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Singular Cycles  Track Bike</a></h3>\n<p>While Singular Cycles is perhaps best known for its drop-bar mountain bikes, adventure touring bikes, and gravel bikes, I couldn’t help myself with this stunning track bike they brought to the showcase.

Tom Sturdy unveiled a client’s Fiadh road bike at Bespoked UK, with a stark and clean white and gold Cerakote finish job hiding many of the component’s material identities. For instance, the integrated cockpit is all titanium, as is the fork, seatpost, and crankset. While 3D technology has enabled Tom Sturdy to elevate his final product, he mentioned he’s interested in doing more in-house machining in the future, stating he had just finished a crankset before the show he’s proud of.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sturdy-Cycles-Fiadh-Ti-Road-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sturdy-Cycles-Fiadh-Ti-Road-47.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sturdy-Cycles-Fiadh-Ti-Road-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sturdy-Cycles-Fiadh-Ti-Road-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Late last year, Sturdy announced its Set Size production bikes, using standardized geometries. These Set Size bikes will retail for £4,800, while a custom model like the Fiadh road shown here can fetch a price of £9,600 and up. The Set Size road model is coming later this year…</em></p>\n<p>I cannot emphasize how clean this bike is in person. It’s impeccable, light, and is truly a work of rideable art. The 52-tooth chainring harkens back to an era of 2x race machines, yet it utilizes a Classified hub system to double the gearing spread. The owner, John, has yet to see the bike in person; we hope we don’t ruin the surprise for him! Well done, Tom!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sturdycycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@SturdyCycles</a></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p>Well, which build is your favorite?
