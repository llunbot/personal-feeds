These suggestions are grayed out inline in the message field until you tap the suggestion in the field or in the QuickType bar.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-ios-math-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-ios-math-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1183w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-ios-math-bordered.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-ios-math-bordered.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"341\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Get conversions inline with Math Results.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you don’t like these solutions? It would seem that going to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em> &gt; <em>Show Math Results</em> and turning it off would disable formula and conversion autosuggestions. In testing, I found that I had to force quit Messages and relaunch it to have the change apply. (Swipe up from the bottom of your screen, then swipe Messages up to quit it.) Re-enabling happened immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Math results appear elsewhere, too. If you don’t want them provided at all, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Screen Time</em> &gt; <em>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</em>, enable <em>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</em>, then tap <em>Intelligence &amp; Siri</em> &gt; <em>Math Result</em>, and set it to <em>Disallow</em>. This is a global switch.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-screen-time-math-disallow-bordered.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-screen-time-math-disallow-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1183w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-screen-time-math-disallow-bordered.png?resize=300%2C136&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mac911-messages-screen-time-math-disallow-bordered.png?resize=768%2C349&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"465\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Turn off Math Results in all apps via Screen Time settings.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader James.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequent Mac 911 questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c7be2c17dcf92e92c0312f93f1edc4befdbca00c10879799812271cd2e1a0e56","category":"Apple"}
