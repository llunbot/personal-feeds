That's not just because of her star turn as Aunty Entity in 1985's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome\"><em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em></a> or her stint as the face of Australia's rugby league.</p>\n<p>Australians of all ages have also been performing a line dance called the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutbush_(dance)\">Nutbush</a>\" at weddings and social events to Turner's hit single (with then-husband Ike Turner) \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutbush_City_Limits\">Nutbush City Limits</a>.\" Turner herself never performed the dance, but when she died, there was a flood of viral TikTok videos of people performing the Nutbush in her honor—including members of the US Embassy in Canberra, who had clearly just learned it for the occasion. Dancers at the 2023 Mundi Mundi Bash in a remote corner of New South Wales set a world record with 6,594 dancers performing the Nutbush at the same time.</p>\n<p>The exact origin of the dance remains unknown, but researchers at the University of South Australia think they understand how the Nutbush became so ubiquitous in Australia, according to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10304312.2024.2331796\">a paper</a> published in the journal Continuum. “What we seem to know is that there was a committee in the New South Wales education department that devised the idea of the Nutbush,” co-author Jon Stratton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/may/05/origins-of-the-nutbush-line-dance-australia-schools\">told the Guardian</a>. “Whether they devised the dance itself, we don’t really know. But what’s interesting is that nobody has come forward.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030863#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030863&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"49cd75ba4332947b18e4d9e35255850e1edb6411a6939cca0d60ce93c39d86b8","category":"Tech"}
