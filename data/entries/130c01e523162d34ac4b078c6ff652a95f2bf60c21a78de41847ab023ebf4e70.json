Later in the year, it will work across a range of other video services, including Plex, Starz, Pluto TV, Sling TV, and ZDF.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌AirPlay‌ allows Apple device users to wirelessly stream video from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> or another Mac, as well as stream audio from almost any Apple device to any <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, ‌Apple TV‌, or compatible third-party speaker. Google has a similar equivalent for its Chromecast devices called Google Cast. Both ‌AirPlay‌ and Google Cast are proprietary technologies, so Amazon's new feature is designed to be interoperable across platforms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple and Google worked with Amazon on the Matter home standard, but they have not yet announced any plans to support Matter Casting and could choose to remain uninvolved. Nevertheless, it is clearly Amazon's wish to make video streaming apps and TV accessories work together more seamlessly, regardless of their platform.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">CES 2024</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/amazon-unveils-matter-casting/\">CES 2024: Amazon Unveils Matter Casting Standard as Interoperable Alternative to AirPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-amazon-unveils-matter-casting-standard-as-interoperable-alternative-to-airplay.2415868/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"130c01e523162d34ac4b078c6ff652a95f2bf60c21a78de41847ab023ebf4e70","category":"Apple"}
