First, let’s look at the details that are likely to carry over…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1507\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-4.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of no22 reactor prototype 3d-printed titanium aero road bike headtube.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-4.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-4-297x224.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-4-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-4-768x579.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Cockpit is slammed with their 3D-printed ti stem and an ENVE bar.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The No.22 Reactor has been their race bike, and this next version is testing with 30-40% less drag than their current semi-integrated Aurora model. And that’s only with CFD design so far, but they’ll be taking it to the wind tunnel along with 3rd party aerodynamicists they’re working with for final optimizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1507\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of no22 reactor prototype 3d-printed titanium aero road bike drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-3-297x224.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-3-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-3-768x579.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>It’s built with a CeramicSpeed-ified SRAM RED, 5Dev ti cranks, and Berk saddle.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just about aero. The drivetrain area is stiffer for better power transfer, and the rest of the bike is tuned for better ride quality to accentuate titanium’s naturally good feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1085\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of no22 reactor prototype 3d-printed titanium aero road bike seat tube and post.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5-1536x694.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5-768x347.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-5-2048x926.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Except for the seat tube, this prototype’s frame is 3D printed from Grade 5 titanium powder as a single piece. The seat tube is carbon fiber, similar to their prior Reactor model, but this one upgrades to an aerodynamic profile. It’s made for them by Ride July.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1507\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-2.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of no22 reactor prototype 3d-printed titanium aero road bike chainstays.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-2-297x224.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-2-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/no22-bikes-reactor-aero-titanium-road-bike-prototype-2-768x579.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>It’s shaped to follow the tire’s contour but will still fit 34mm wide tires.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For production bikes, they’ll use a blend of 3D-printed sections with more traditionally bent and shaped titanium tubes, welding everything together and smoothing where necessary. They say that will give them better control of the final product’s tolerances and allow them to do the incredible anodized finishes they’re known for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re headed to the MADE Show in Portland, OR, August 23-25th, check it out in person.
