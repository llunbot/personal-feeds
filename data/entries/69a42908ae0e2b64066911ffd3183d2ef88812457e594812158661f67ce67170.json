Even if you didn’t watch “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kONMe7YnO8\">George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead</a>,” you probably stumbled on <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/george-carlin-ai-generated-comedy-special-1235868315/\">some</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/technology/george-carlin-resurrected-without-permission-by-self-described-comedy-ai\">many</a>, <a href=\"https://bgr.com/tech/ai-shouldnt-bring-anyone-back-from-the-dead-especially-late-comedian-george-carlin/\">many</a> headlines <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/01/09/ai-may-have-generated-this-new-george-carlin-comedy-special/\">suggesting</a> that AI had brought the legendary comedian “<a href=\"https://webn.iheart.com/featured/nudge/content/2024-01-11-george-carlins-back-from-the-dead-w-new-ai-stand-up-special/\">back from the dead</a>” in some sense.</p>\n<p>Or maybe you saw some of the disgusted and/or panicked responses to the special among Carlin fans, comedy purists, and AI fearmongers. Those included Carlin’s daughter, Kelly, who <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/george-carlins-daughter-seeking-legal-action-against-ai-special?ref=home\">told The Daily Beast</a> that she’s talking to lawyers about the possibility of legal action against the special’s creators, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Dudesy\">the comedy podcast Dudesy</a>.</p>\n<p>But I think that anger is at least partially misplaced. After spending the last few weeks diving down a distractingly deep rabbit hole, I’m convinced that Dudesy’s “AI-generated” George Carlin special was actually written by a human, using voice- and image-generation tools to essentially perform in “AI face” as part of an ongoing comedy bit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997974#p3\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997974&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"69a42908ae0e2b64066911ffd3183d2ef88812457e594812158661f67ce67170","category":"Tech"}
