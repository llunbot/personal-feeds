The Joshua Tree Charging Outpost, which has 12 DC fast chargers, is now accessible to any EV with a CCS1 charging port, as well as any Tesla or EV equipped with a native NACS (J3400) port using an adapter. A planned hardware upgrade in the future will add native NACS cables.

The Rivian Adventure Network currently has deployed banks of fast chargers at 91 sites across the US, with another 12 in the works.
