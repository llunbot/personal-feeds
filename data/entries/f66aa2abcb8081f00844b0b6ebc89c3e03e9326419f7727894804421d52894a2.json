Dual Charger</a> comes with pin and open heads stored inside the handle, a 46” hose, an all-in-one Presta/Schrader head, and a switch allowing airflow optimization for high volume, low-pressure tires or high-pressure, low-volume tires – making it easy to fill mountain tires quickly and road tires easily and precisely.</p><p></p><p>The features of the Dual Charger are great – the high volume mode helped us get to 30psi with a Maxxis Minion DHRII in only 22 pumps, the fastest of any pump we tested, and the high-pressure mode made it easy to achieve and fine-tune higher road bike pressures. The switch between the two modes is also easy to use hands-free with your foot. Compared to the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ftopeak-smartgauge-d2x-digital-pressure-gauge\">ToPeak SmartGauge D2X</a>, the Dual Charger’s analog dial read an average of 6.6% high at 10 psi intervals from 10-50 psi, so we’d recommend keeping a trusted pressure gauge nearby if you’re concerned with accuracy (something most of us should have and use anyway). </p><p></p><p>The 46″ hose makes reaching your valves easy, whether your bike is on the floor or up in a work stand. Though the analog gauge is located at the base of the pump, it is large and has big numbers that make it very easy to read. Stability is also excellent with a wide, 3-footed base and grip tape added for a little extra traction.

The two-sided head easily accommodates both Schrader and Presta valves, pumping efficiency is about average, and the -2% measured accuracy was the second best in our testing. </p><p></p><p>Now in its third version, the Joe Blow Sport has been around for many years and ToPeak has made incremental changes to improve its performance over previous models. With a max PSI of 160, it’s more than capable of pumping up your road bike tires while still inflating higher-volume tires with little fuss. Pumping action is smooth and the mid-sized analog gauge is relatively easy to read on top of being more accurate than most. This pump simply gets the job done, and, in our experience, lasts a long time for such an affordable model.</p><p></p><p>The Joe Blow Sport III is not without its faults, however. The comparatively short 30” hose is mounted at the bottom of the pump and limits its reach and usability with bikes in the work stand. While perfectly functional, the locking switch on the dual-sided head can be a little tricky to operate with one hand, and the rounded steel foot isn’t the <em>most</em> stable, comparatively speaking. That said, the bright yellow color is easy to spot in a crowded garage, the operation is quite smooth, and the fair price makes the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F132166%2Ftopeak-joeblow-sport-iii-bike-floor-pump%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">Joe Blow Sport III</a> a great option for anyone looking to save a little cash. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F132166%2Ftopeak-joeblow-sport-iii-bike-floor-pump%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077KXQ995/brbggearcyclingbikepump-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The ToPeak Jow Blow Sport III bike pump in use in a home workshop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ToPeak-Joe-Blow-Sport-III-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The ToPeak Joe Blow Sport III is a versatile pump that should meet most rider’s needs at a modest price.

While many tubeless tires can be installed using a standard floor pump, some are more stubborn and require the release of a more powerful burst of air to get them seated. In addition to working like a small air compressor, this pump also functions as a regular floor pump, making it a versatile option for the home workshop. </p><p></p><p>The TLR Flash Charger features a digital gauge with large text that displays tire pressure in precise 0.5 psi increments up to 160 psi. The gauge’s position at the top of the reservoir makes it very easy to read, and it proved to be the most accurate in our testing at -1% when compared to our ToPeak digital gauge. </p><p></p><p>The reservoir can be pumped to a maximum pressure of 160 psi, although it does get significantly more challenging to add air to the cylinder above 125 psi, and the airflow speed and volume from the reservoir is nearly enough to completely seat tubeless mountain bike tires. In five tests, it always provided some small pops, with the tire entirely seated after following the reservoir with 5 or 6 easy manual strokes of the pump. If you don’t own a compressor and change your tubeless tires at home frequently, a pump like the TLR Flash Charger is an excellent tool to have around.</p><p></p><p>Bypassing the reservoir and using the TLR Flash Charger as a normal floor pump, we found the all-in-one head to be relatively easy to use but with some minor leaking and sensitivity to positioning on Presta valves. While it is a bit less efficient than regular floor pumps, it is comparable in that regard to the other reservoir pump we tested while having an impressively accurate and more easily readable gauge.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F183366%2Fbontrager-tlr-flash-charger-floor-pump%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Bontrager TLR Flash Charger</a> is a great pump that can reliably help with tubeless installations and is a solid deal for a well-constructed reservoir-style pump at $160 – making it our top choice for anyone seeking a pump for at-home tubeless tire installation.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F183366%2Fbontrager-tlr-flash-charger-floor-pump%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-pumps-accessories%2Fbike-pumps%2Fbontrager-tlr-flash-charger-floor-pump%2Fp%2F24238%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dblack\">Check Price at Trek Bikes</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bontrager TLR Flash Charger bike pump digital gauge detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-TLR-Flash-Charger-gauge-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Not only does the Bontrager TLR Flash Charger work consistently well to seat tubeless tires but the large digital gauge is impressively accurate and easy to read.

It is also the smoothest pump with the best construction, great stability, and an exceptionally nice <em>Hiro</em> Presta valve chuck (you can thread the chuck attachment directly onto Schrader valves as well). We loved the tacky rubber feet on the bottom of the base, excellent stability, ultra-smooth pumping action, solid wooden handle, and magnetic chuck storage point. </p><p></p><p>The digital readout gauge uses 0.5 psi increments and accuracy was not too far off, with average readings 5.6% higher than our ToPeak Smartgauge D2X. While we didn’t find the digital gauge to be more accurate than an analog gauge, it is certainly more repeatable and easy to read. It turns on when you start pumping or press the power button and turns off automatically, plus it comes with 2 of the coin cell batteries that power the display. It also has a preset function where you can enter your desired pressure and it alerts you when you’ve reached it. While we didn’t really see a use for the preset option, it does not interfere with the easy-to-read digital display or normal pump expiration in any way. </p><p></p><p>The build of the SuperPista Digital is as impressive as its price tag. Compared to other pumps, its design is elegant with sturdy metal construction, an Ash wood handle, and a magnetic chuck attachment. The three-footed base is very stable in use with rubber feet that prevent it from slipping around or scratching your floors. The 48″ hose is attached under the digital gauge giving it a long reach and is super supple and easy to deal with.

With a max pressure of 350 psi and threaded Schrader head, the Air Tool UHP is much quicker and easier to use than traditional hand-held shock pumps and impressively accurate, averaging only -0.6% off readings from our ToPeak Smartgauge D2X at 50 psi intervals from 50-300 psi in a Rockshox Super Deluxe rear shock and 25 psi increments between 25-100 psi in a Fox 36 Performance fork. </p><p></p><p>The micro-adjust release valve helps fine-tune shock pressures with the higher volume stroke and the 48” braided hose is long and flexible enough to reach suspension valves, though forks are definitely easier when the bike is not in a stand. While the Air Tool UHP does come with a Presta valve adaptor and it does work to inflate tires, it is a high-pressure pump, so it takes a long time and the gauge didn’t register pressures through the Presta adaptor. </p><p></p><p>So, while it is not a two birds, one-stone shock/tire pump solution, its accuracy, high-quality Schrader chuck, stable base, and ability to quickly reach high pressures in suspension components make the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-air-tool-uhp-floor-pump\">Specialized Air Tool UHP</a> an excellent addition to your workshop if you work on or adjust pressures in your suspension components regularly.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-air-tool-uhp-floor-pump\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Air Tool UHP bike pump attached to a rear shock in the home workshop\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Specialized-Air-Tool-UHP-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Specialized Air Tool UHP is a standing shock pump that makes quick work of inflating and adjusting pressures in suspension components.

The alloy construction is lightweight but super tough – and it is small enough to stuff in a bike bag, carry-on, duffel bag, or large backpack. And, if you’re not flying somewhere with your bike, its compact dimensions and lay flat design virtually disappears in your vehicle but is there when you need it. </p><p></p><p>Lezyne makes the purpose of this pump clear in its name, and the Travel Floor Drive is designed specifically for travel. If you’ve ever flown with your bike, then you’re probably aware that packing a full-size pump isn’t really an option, and using a hand pump isn’t necessarily ideal. Thanks to its compact dimensions (20″ x 7.6″ x 2.5″) and lay-flat design, it can fit in most bike travel cases and bags, and its 865-gram weight is about half of a standard floor pump. </p><p></p><p>Still, it has a decent-sized air chamber, pushes a good amount of air, and is capable of reaching pressures up to 160 psi. It works better for high-pressure/low-volume tires but also works on high-volume tires with a little patience. This pump uses Lezyne’s <em>ABS Flip Chuck</em> inline threaded valve attachment that reverses to work with Shrader or Presta valves and has a pressure release button to make it easier to remove without also pulling out your tubeless valve core. (Pro Tip: Make sure your valve cores are tightened really well before using a thread-on pump head like this) Or just pop on the included Speed Chuck and simply press it onto any Presta valve stem, then pull it off to release…no screwing around (<em>pun intended</em>) with the threaded attachment.</p><p></p><p>Due to the compact nature of the CNC Travel Floor Drive, there are some inherent compromises. It is on the shorter side, so taller people will need to bend over more when using it. The hose is also quite short, so you’ll need to position valve stems within range. Its narrow base is also not the most stable, and the smaller, 1.5″ analog gauge isn’t always the easiest to read.

With more than 2,230 positive reviews on Amazon, it’s easily one of the most popular pumps on the market, and it’s been available for years with no changes to the design whatsoever—including, sadly, that neon green color.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, where this pump gets the highest marks is its ease of use. Compared to some of the higher-end models, the <em>AerTight</em> valve attachment (stick it onto your tube’s valve and flip the tab into the upright position to lock it on) is among the easiest to snap on and take off, plus it has a pressure bleed valve if you need to fine-tune the pressure. It even comes with an attachment for inflating soccer balls and volleyballs, so if you have an active family, this is a great tool to have on hand.</p><p></p><p>While the gauge isn’t the most accurate around, it’s pretty close and works as well as several pumps that cost more than double. Our main gripes are that the somewhat narrow base isn’t the <em>most </em>stable, the 34″ hose doesn’t offer the best reach, and the numbers on the mid-sized analog gauge are fairly small and not the easiest to read.  </p><p></p><p>Still, if you just need to top off your tires before rides, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OP5KB0K/brbggearcyclingbikepump-20\">AerGun X-1000</a> is an effective and affordable bike pump that gets the job done for less than the competition.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OP5KB0K/brbggearcyclingbikepump-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best of the Rest</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tAnother Good Value\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-core-3-floor-pump\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlackburn Core 3\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$80</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Valves</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Presta and Schrader reversible head</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Max PSI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>160 (11 bar)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hose Length</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>50” (127cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Gauge</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Analog</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1,580g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-core-3-floor-pump\">\n\n<img width=\"2280\" height=\"1520\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Pumps of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3.jpeg 2280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blackburn-Core-3-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good value</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stable and wide, rubber footed base</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smooth feel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lifetime warranty</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sturdy, durable construction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not our favorite head lock design, awkward operation and very stiff</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Paul Clauss</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-core-3-floor-pump\">Blackburn Core 3</a> is a clean-looking steel pump with a wide, stable base and hollow plastic handle. The white, black, and red 3” analog gauge is easy to read and the reversible head allows use with both Schrader and Presta valves – though you will need to unthread it and flip it around to switch between the two. The Core 3’s 50″ hose makes it easy to use whether your bikes are on the ground, in the work stand, or on the bike rack, and it is reasonably smooth, efficient, stable, and accurate (averaging only 4.3% higher than the Topeak Smartgauge D2X).</p><p></p><p>The Core 3 does everything a standard bike pump should well enough and the lifetime warranty is a nice touch at $80. Our primary gripe is the head design. The top-mounted lever can be difficult to operate with one hand, at least compared to other head designs, and can be awkward to open and close, pushing fingers into spokes when taking the head on and off valves. It works and has a solid connection, but the unique layout and stiff feel were more difficult to use than most other pump heads in our test.</p><p></p><p>At $80, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-core-3-floor-pump\">Blackburn Core 3</a> is a standard bike pump. While we didn’t love the lever design on the head, the pump functions well enough, with average accuracy, good stability, volume/efficiency, smooth action, and a long hose. The lifetime warranty also makes it a good choice for riders looking for a sturdy and economical floor pump that should last for years.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-core-3-floor-pump\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089DS6RQJ/brbggearcyclingbikepump-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpro-team-hp-floor-pump\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPRO Floorpump Team\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$115</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Valves</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Presta and Schrader all-in-one</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Max PSI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>220 (15.2 bar)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hose Length</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>47” (120cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Gauge</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Analog</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1,500g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpro-team-hp-floor-pump\">\n\n<img width=\"2292\" height=\"1528\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Pumps of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP.jpeg 2292w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PRO-Team-HP-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>All-in-one head is easy to use and has a good, sturdy feel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Relatively efficient</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to read analog gauge with clear color differentiation between high volume and high pressure readings</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Greater gauge detail between 0-40 psi</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Metal handle feels solid</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Smooth pumping action</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stand is not the most stable in the test</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No rubber padding on bottom of metal foot</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Gauge only goes up to 140 psi</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Paul Clauss</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpro-team-hp-floor-pump\">Pro Floorpump Team</a> features a solid metal handle, an easy-to-use all-in-one head, and a 3.5” diameter gray and blue analog gauge. Taking only 27 pumps to fill a Minion DHRII to 30psi on a 31mm internal width rim, it was among the more efficient pumps in our test, and the all-in-one head plays nicely and securely with both Presta and Schrader valves. Accuracy against the Topeak Smartgauge D2X was relatively good at +5.3% average and we found the Pro Floorpump Team to have a reliable, user-friendly, and efficient feel.</p><p></p><p>The analog gauge is located at the base of the pump, but its large 3.5″ diameter and contrasting colors make it easy to read. The first half of the dial also shows more detail for lower pressures between 0 and 40 psi, making it easier to get closer to your target. After that, the gauge goes up to 140 psi (well below its max of 220 psi), which should be more than ample for today’s road bike tire pressures. Pumping action is smooth, and the 47″ hose makes it easy to reach your valves.</p><p></p><p>Our only gripes with the Pro Floorpump Team were with the footing. While the metal foot is large enough, it is all forward of the main body of the pump and not as stable as we would have hoped when standing behind the pump (oriented to see the gauge forward). It was manageable but required more stabilization through our feet than most competitors. We also wish Pro had included rubber feet to give the Floorpump Pro a bit more grip. </p><p></p><p>With that said, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpro-team-hp-floor-pump\">Pro Floorpump Team</a> is an easy-to-use, durably constructed pump, and was the second most efficient in our test, losing out only to the high volume setting on the Bontrager Dual Charger. It is also worth noting that, if you are a rare rider who needs a pump with a maximum pressure over 160 psi, the Pro Floorpump team will go to 220 psi. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpro-team-hp-floor-pump\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P2CPTB9/brbggearcyclingbikepump-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Flezyne-classic-floor-drive-pump\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLezyne Classic Floor Drive 3.5\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$80</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Valve</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Presta and Schrader thread-on</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Max PSI</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>220 (15.2 bar)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Hose Length</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>46\" (117cm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Gauge</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Analog</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1,885g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Flezyne-classic-floor-drive-pump\">\n\n<img width=\"2298\" height=\"1532\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Pumps of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5.jpeg 2298w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lezyne-Classic-Floor-Drive-3.5-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Slim/sleek</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Does the job</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fully serviceable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderate price</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Screw-on valve is less user-friendly</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Paul Clauss</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Like most Lezyne pumps, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Flezyne-classic-floor-drive-pump\">Classic Floor Drive 3.5</a> looks nice with a sleek design, metallic paint finish, and a varnished wood handle. And, at $80, it is moderately priced and performs its duties admirably with a max pressure of 220 psi, smooth pumping action, and a large and easy-to-read 3.5″ diameter analog gauge.</p><p></p><p>It has a 46″ long hose that easily stretches to your valves even with your bike in a work stand. The head is Lezyne’s <em>ABS-1 Pro</em> chuck which is a reversible thread-on affair that attaches securely and has a tight seal. Personal preferences vary between the thread-on style and press-on/lever-lock style, and while it is very secure, the thread-on attachment is less user-friendly, more time-consuming to use, and can accidentally unscrew your Presta valve core if you aren’t careful. That said, it also comes with a fine-tip inflator for basketballs, footballs, etc., and a valve core removal tool is built into the back of the head.</p><p></p><p>The Classic Floor Drive is relatively stable when pumping with a wide, 3-footed base. The 3.5″ diameter analog gauge is large and easy to read, and it goes all the way up to its max psi of 220. Lezyne states that it is designed for high-pressure applications and its optimal pressure range is between 80 and 180 psi. Still, it works well enough with higher-volume mountain bike tires if you’re willing to give it a few extra strokes. </p><p> </p><p>One gripe we have is that the hose never stays put in the keeper at the base which makes it less tidy than we’d like and occasionally rattles around in the trunk en route to the trailhead. That’s not a deal breaker by any means, as the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Flezyne-classic-floor-drive-pump\">Lezyne Classic Floor Drive 3.5</a> is a nice-looking pump that does exactly what it’s supposed to.

Joe Blow Booster</a> is a pump aimed at making tubeless tire installation quick and easy. Like similar pumps, it works like a manual air compressor equipped with a chamber that can be pumped to 160 psi and then released in a quick burst. It also functions as a regular floor pump with a max pressure of 160 psi, making a versatile option for tubeless installation <em>and</em> everyday use on any type of tires. </p><p></p><p>Just like the Bontrager TLR Flash Charger, the Joe Blow Booster releases a large burst of air from the reservoir to help with seating stubborn tubeless tires. This pump has been on the market for a while, and though it works pretty well, it didn’t knock our socks off with its performance. Like other pumps of this style, it takes significant effort to increase the reservoir pressure above 120 psi, and on top of that, we had mixed results in our tubeless tire seating tests compared to the more consistent Bontrager pump. It seems this inconsistency could be attributed to the relatively slow airflow speed when the reservoir is released. When it does work properly, it still takes several supplemental pumps to fully seat the tire, which is fairly typical.  </p><p></p><p>When not using the reservoir, the Joe Blow Booster functions just like a normal floor pump, though it was one of the least efficient in our test and the all-in-one Presta/Schrader compatible <em>SmartHead</em> had a sloppy feel when connected to Presta valves, leaking more than other valves and even getting blown off once when releasing the reservoir from a full charge. </p><p></p><p>Beyond that, it is quite stable, the large analog gauge is positioned at the top of the cylinder and is very easy to read, and the gauge accuracy was relatively good at just +4.3%. We love the idea of reservoir-style pumps for dealing with tubeless tires, and, even with its less consistent performance, the <a

Bikerumor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bikerumor, we ride bikes, a lot. For work, play, training, racing, you name it, our lives revolve around bikes of all kinds. With all that riding comes a lot of tires, and we are constantly using bike pumps to install or add air to tires on our townies, road, gravel, and mountain bikes. Turns out, the lowly bike pump is one of the most frequently used and important tools any of us have. We also know that finding the right bike pump can be a challenge, and we are always in search of the best models to make our lives easier while keeping our tires at the perfect pressure for optimal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our like pumps buyer’s guide, we enlisted frequent Bikerumor contributor, Paul Clauss, to test and compare all of the models in this review. Paul is an avid cyclist who lives outside of Burlington, VT where he spends the majority of his time on his mountain bike and his gravel bike/commuter. He enjoys technical trail riding and knows the importance and benefits of a properly inflated tire and its relation to his enjoyment and performance on the trail. A mechanical engineer by trade, Paul loves to tinker with things, scrutinize designs, and perform quantifiable tests to help him discern differences in the performance of the products he tests. In addition to bike pumps, Paul has tested <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-dropper-post/\">dropper seatposts</a>, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">best flat pedals</a>, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-locks/\">secure bike locks</a>, among others. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How We Tested Bike Pumps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After rounding up a diverse selection of the best bike pumps on the market in 2023, we ran each model through the same rigorous testing process to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, and performance differences. While some of these pumps have been in a staff member’s garage for years, we tested them all over the course of several weeks, rotating through them for everyday pumping needs. Each model was also used for a number of repeatable tests in search of quantifiable results. These included checking gauge accuracy at 10 psi intervals against our ToPeak SmartGauge D2X digital pressure gauge, as well as a pumping efficiency test to determine the number of strokes needed to inflate a Maxxis Minion DHR II to 30 psi. During these tests, we evaluated the ease of use and security of valve chucks/heads, stability in use, comfort of handles, smoothness of the pumping action, and readability of gauges. The more specialized pumps were tested for their intended uses of seating tubeless tires or adding air to suspension components. When testing concluded,  we zeroed in our favorites and those that excel for specific reasons compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Group shot of most of the bike pumps we tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Types-of-bike-pumps-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>There are lots of bike pumps on the market that come not just in different colors, but varying gauge styles, pumping volumes, or to meet specific needs.

A major factor is the type of tires you need to inflate along with the type of pump, type of valves (and valve attachment method), the volume of air moved per stroke of the pump (the efficiency of the pump), the gauge accuracy, and the overall build quality and stability of the pump. We’ll provide more detail on each of these areas below:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Bike Pumps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The review focuses on floor pumps, which are aptly named for their ability to stand up and be used on the floor (or parking lot at a trailhead). We tested three different types: standard floor or track pumps, tubeless booster pumps, and a high-pressure shock pump. Portable options like hand pumps, frame pumps, and Co2 inflators are other common tools for adding air to tires, though they are typically reserved for use in the field.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The PRO Floorpump Team is an example of a Standard, or Track pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Standard-Track-Pump-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Standard, or Track pumps, like the PRO Floorpump Team, are the most common type of bike pump. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Standard Floor Pumps or Track Pumps</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard floor pumps, also known as track pumps, transfer air directly from the pump to the tire through the valve. If you’ve ever used a bicycle pump, chances are you’ve used a standard floor pump. They can be used with all types of tires and wheels, and, while standard floor pumps are not as effective for mounting tubeless tires as an air compressor or reservoir-style pump (in theory), they can often get the job done, especially if the tire has a relatively snug fit on the rim, or you have prior experience and good technique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard floor pumps are often optimized to work better for high-volume/low-pressure or high-pressure/low-volume applications. High-volume pumps typically move more air per pump, making them well-suited to inflating the larger volume of lower-pressure mountain bike tires. High-pressure pumps generally move less air per pump but are better suited to inflating lower-volume tires, like those on road bikes, to higher pressures. Either style of pump still works for all types of tires. Some pumps are capable of performing both tasks and are equipped with switches to change between high volume and high-pressure pump settings, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-pumps-accessories%2Fbike-pumps%2Fbontrager-dual-charger-floor-pump%2Fp%2F21854%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dred\">Bontrager Dual Charger</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The ToPeak Joe Blow Booster bike pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tubeless-Booster-Pump-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Tubeless booster pumps, like the ToPeak Joe Blow Booster, are essentially a manual air compressor and a bike pump in one, and they help when seating tubeless tires at home. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tubeless Booster Pumps</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tubeless booster pumps are very similar to standard floor pumps but include a reservoir that can be pumped up to a high pressure and then quickly released. Tubeless pumps strive to act as small manual air compressors to make tubeless setup easy. Quickly releasing high air volumes helps “snap” the bead of tubeless tires to seat them on the rim. They also function as regular pumps for everyday use, making them a versatile addition to the home workshop for those who change their tubeless tires frequently. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F183366%2Fbontrager-tlr-flash-charger-floor-pump%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Bontrager TLR Flash Charger</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F190765%2Ftopeak-joeblow-booster-floor-pump-with-smarthead%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">ToPeak Joe Blow Booster</a> are the two models of this style that we tested, although there are a few other options on the market as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As tubeless tires have grown in popularity and are now widely used not only on mountain bikes but also gravel and road, tubeless pumps are becoming increasingly common. While the models we tested certainly helped make tubeless setup easier, it isn’t always necessary to use one for tubeless tire installation. Some tubeless tires can easily be installed with a standard pump depending on the tire brand/model and the rim combination. Other tubeless tires can be more stubborn, and that’s where the Booster pumps come in handy. It is worth noting that pumping the reservoirs on these pumps up to 160 psi can be somewhat challenging, especially when you get above 120 psi. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Specialized Air Tool UHP is a standing shock pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Shock-pump-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Standing shock pumps like the Specialized Air Tool UHP are great for working on suspension components where you need super low volumes and high pressures. Note that the gauge goes up to 350 psi. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Shock Pumps</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Shock pumps are more of a niche product for those who work on or adjust their mountain bike suspension components regularly. The air chambers of suspension forks and rear shocks are quite small, and they generally need to be inflated to significantly higher pressures than tires. For this reason, shock pumps move smaller volumes of air, but are typically capable of reaching must higher pressures. A great example of a shock pump is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-air-tool-uhp-floor-pump\">Specialized Air Tool UHP</a> which has a threaded Schrader head for attaching to shocks and forks and a max psi of 350. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most people use small hand-held shock pumps at home or on the trail, a standing model like the Specialized Air Tool makes adding air to suspension components much quicker and easier. These are most common in bike shops, but those who tinker with or service their own suspension at home can benefit from them as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Side by side photo of Presta and Schrader valves for comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Type-of-valves-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Presta (left) and Schrader (right) are the two main types of valves used on bicycle tubes. Most tubeless valve stems are Presta. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Valves</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike tube/tire valves will almost always be either Presta or Schrader. There is a third valve type, known as Dunlop valves, though they are fairly uncommon in this day and age. Schrader valves are like those found on your vehicle and they are larger in diameter and generally found on more value-oriented or electric commuter bikes. Presta valves are most common among higher-end road/mountain bikes. Most tubeless valves are Presta valves, though there are some Schrader options available. Both types of valves have been around for quite a while and every pump we tested has configurations that work with both Presta and Schrader valves. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage.jpeg\"><img width=\"1528\" height=\"1019\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage.jpeg\" alt=\"Collage of four different bike pump heads/chucks for comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage.jpeg 1528w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-Valve-head-collage-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The heads, or chucks, of bike pumps vary in their designs and user-friendliness, but all of the pumps we tested have the ability to work with both Presta and Schrader valves. (photos: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Valve Chucks/Connections/Heads</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While all the pumps in our 2023 test accommodate both Presta and Schrader valves, they do so in different ways. Some pumps have heads that thread onto the valve while others have lever-lock style heads that tighten on the valve when the lever is flipped. Many pumps use an all-in-one head style, which easily connects to either Presta or Schrader valves but tends to be more sensitive to angular changes and can leak a bit more when being put on or taken off. Other pumps, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsilca-super-pista-digital-floor-pump\">Silca SuperPista Digital</a>, use a removable chuck for Presta valves that threads onto a Schrader connection directly on the hose. Others, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fblackburn-core-3-floor-pump\">Blackburn Core 3</a> and the Lezyne Classic Floor Drive, use a reversible threaded tip on the pump head – which enables a tighter fit for each valve type but needs to be set up appropriately whenever a new type of valve is used. All of these are good options but, as riders who generally find ourselves using Presta valves, we were most impressed with the easy operation and lack of air leaks when using the Silca SuperPista Digital Hiro chuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The mode switch on the Bontrager Dual Charger bike pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bontrager-Dual-Charger-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The mode switch on the Bontrager Dual Charger allows you to switch between high volume and high pressure. This pump proved to the most efficient in our testing in its high volume setting. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pumping Efficiency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pumping efficiency is a function of how much air is pushed through the pump into the tire during each stroke, and its importance will vary somewhat depending on whether you need high volume or high pressure or both. All of the pumps we tested will fill your tires relatively quickly (with the exception of the suspension-focused Specialized Air Tool UHP), and regular top-offs will typically only require a few pumps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested pumping efficiency by counting how many strokes it took to fill a Maxxis Minion DHRII to 30 psi five times and then taking the average. Across all the pumps we tested, the average number of strokes to 30 psi was 36, with the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-pumps-accessories%2Fbike-pumps%2Fbontrager-dual-charger-floor-pump%2Fp%2F21854%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dred\">Bontrager Dual Charger</a> leading at 22 pumps (on high volume mode) and the Topeak Joe Blow Booster requiring the most at 47. Having used many pumps over the years, none of the pumps we tested felt super slow – but a more efficient pump will always save time and effort and may be worth consideration if you are frequently filling tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges.jpeg\"><img width=\"1528\" height=\"1019\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges.jpeg\" alt=\"Collage of bike pump gauges for comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges.jpeg 1528w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-Pump-Gauges-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Bike pump gauges come in either analog or digital flavors in varying sizes, positions, and colors, some of which are easier to read and more accurate than others. (photos: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of Gauges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The pumps we tested come with either analog gauges/dials or battery-powered digital displays. Both types work relatively well, although their location and size can make some more easy to read than others. In general, digital displays are considered to be more precise as they can show the pressure readings in smaller increments than can be read on most analog dials. That said, a digital gauge generally adds to the cost of a bike pump and will require you to change a battery at some point in its lifespan. Many brands make pumps with both types of gauges, so you have options to suit your preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gauge Accuracy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most gauges are fairly accurate and will get you within a few psi of your desired pressure. We measured the accuracy of both analog and digital gauges by pumping up tires by 10 psi at a time, checking the gauge pressure at each interval against the pressure read by our <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ftopeak-smartgauge-d2x-digital-pressure-gauge\">Topeak SmartGauge D2X</a> digital pressure gauge, and taking the average difference percentage from pump gauge pressures at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 psi. On average, pump gauges showed pressures 2.45% higher than the D2X digital gauge, with the most accurate pump (the Bontrager TLR Flash Charger) averaging readings 1% lower than the digital gauge, and the least accurate pump (the Bontrager Dual Charger) averaging 6.6% higher readings than the Topeak gauge.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Using the ToPeak SmartGauge D2X to check the accuracy of the bike pump gauges\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digital-Pressure-Gauge-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>We sued the ToPeak SmartGauge D2X digital pressure gauge to check the accuracy of the pumps we tested in a series of tests. A tool like this is very handy to ensure the accuracy of your tire pressures. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But how important is gauge accuracy? Provided you usually use the same pump to inflate your tires, it may be slightly annoying that it isn’t perfect, but it should be easy to work with. Finding the optimal pressure for your tires, rims, terrain, and riding style requires experimentation, and, if you are using the same pump every time, you can feel out pressure changes by using any baseline reading from the pump. You may find that your tires feel great at 28 psi on your pump dial, which might read 24 psi on a digital pressure gauge. But you know that using your pump, you like the feel of 28 psi on that gauge, so you can compensate for the difference. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since changes in tire pressure can have a relatively large effect on the feel and performance of your tires on road, mountain, and gravel bikes, having a separate pressure gauge is always a good idea for those looking to get the most from their tires. This will help ensure consistency and accuracy, and most feature an air release button for fine-tuning of pressure. We used the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ftopeak-smartgauge-d2x-digital-pressure-gauge\">ToPeak SmartGauge D2X</a>, which, while somewhat expensive, we found to work very well.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike pump comparison shot of different foot/base designs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pump-stability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The base or feet of bike pumps varies, though all strive to provide good levels of stability with varying success. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it isn’t the most important aspect of a bike pump’s performance, stability in use is definitely a consideration, and they are not all created equal in this regard. In general, the more the stable the better so you’re not constantly knocking it over in your workspace or having to constantly stabilize it with your feet while pumping. We found that we preferred pumps with wide, three-legged feet for multi-directional stability, and we also appreciated pumps like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingbikepump&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsilca-super-pista-digital-floor-pump\">Silca Superpista Digital</a> and Blackburn Core 3 for their rubber padding on the bottom of the foot, which helped avoid slippage and floor scratches. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality bike pumps can be shockingly durable and last for decades if treated with a reasonable amount of care. Most mid to high-end models are made with steel or alloy bodies and feet, and many can be repaired if they are damaged. Plastic tends to be cheaper but much less durable, so typically spending a little more on a pump will get you a longer-lasting product. We recommend buying from recognizable name brands like Bontrager, Specialized, ToPeak, Blackburn, and Lezyne, as they are most likely to stand behind their products with warranties and many have replacement parts to keep your pump running smoothly should it ever get damaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Group photo of most of the bike pumps we tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bike-pump-value-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Most bike pumps will last you for many years, regardless of price. That said, they do vary dramatically in price with the models pictured here ranging from $60 to $349. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Price/Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, bike pumps are relatively affordable tools that usually last for many years. You definitely don’t need to break the bank to get a great pump that covers your needs, and we found the sweet spot to be around $75 to $100. In fact, our favorite pump of the test was the Bontrager Dual Charger that retails for $75. Of course, you can spend less, and the super affordable <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OP5KB0K/brbggearcyclingbikepump-20\">AerGun X-1000</a> will get the job done for less frequent users or those on a tighter budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pumps with special features, like tubeless booster pumps, require more materials and engineering, and they typically command a higher price as a result. Still, even at $160, the Bontrager TLR Flash Charger could be worth its weight in gold if you frequently install tubeless tires at home. At the highest end of the price spectrum, the $349 Silca SuperPista Digital won’t be for everyone, but it is an impressively well-made bike pump that’s sure to please anyone who is willing and able to spend that much. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Bike Pumps</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Why do some gauges go so high? Does anyone pump to 220psi???</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Well, some track racers do pump their tires to 160psi or more, but that’s only because they are riding on a perfectly smooth surface in a controlled environment. Regular riding outdoors, on real roads and trails, needs far less tire pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, and especially with tubeless tires becoming the norm, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/08/07/aasq-80-zipp-pumps-out-the-answers-for-your-questions-on-tire-pressure/\" target=\"_blank\">it’s been proven</a> that lower tire pressures yield more comfort, better traction, <em>and</em> improved efficiency. Yep, lower really is better. Brands like Silca have even <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/03/10/find-your-perfect-tire-pressure-for-road-gravel-track-w-new-silca-pro-pressure-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">made guides</a> to help you find <em>your</em> best tire pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why do floor pump gauges read so high? Because they need to account for the pressure spikes that occur when pumping. Next time you’re inflating your tire, notice how the needle spikes really high on each stroke. The gauge needs to have room for those spikes or it can be damaged, which means it will no longer be accurate. Specifically, they need 20-30% extra in order to safely cover the higher pressures generated during your pump stroke.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><br />What about portable pumps and CO2 cartridges?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Portable hand pumps and CO2 cartridges are intended for use on the trail and should be carried on longer rides, especially on longer rides that you won’t want to walk out of if something goes wrong. But, due to the small size of portable hand pumps, they are time consuming to use with high volume tires and difficult to use with high pressure tires. CO2 cartridges are compact and easy to carry in a hip pack (or in frame storage), but they are low volume and can only be used once. Hand pumps and CO2 cartridges are great for use on the road or trail, but we recommend investing in floor pump to make maintenance easier at the house.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><br />What about air compressors?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Air compressors are great for tubeless setup! But, they are also relatively expensive, loud, and difficult to throw in your car for a road trip. While having an air compressor is wonderful, floor pumps are an indispensable piece of gear that makes it easy for any cyclist to keep their tires inflated to their desired pressure.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>What tire pressure should I run?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It depends on the type of bike and tire you’re running. All bike tires will have a recommended psi range listed on their sidewalls, so try to stay within that range. For most road riders, pumping tires to between 70 and 90 psi is a good starting point, while mountain bikers will run anywhere from 18 to 35 psi depending on the rider’s weight and the terrain. It is often a process of trial and error to find the optimal pressure for your tires, riding style, terrain, or road conditions to get the best performance from them. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How often do you need to pump up tires?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Tire pressure should be checked before each ride even though it may not need to be adjusted every time you take out your bike. Some tires will hold air pressure perfectly for extended periods, but over time, and sometimes overnight, small amounts of pressure can leak that can impact your tire’s performance or even be a safety issue. Checking your pressure is quick and easy, and adding air takes only a few seconds, so it is worth doing every time you head out for a ride.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><br />What is the difference between a shock pump and a pump for tires?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Shock pumps are optimized for use with high-pressure, low-volume air suspension components. While most air forks and rear shocks use a standard Schrader valve and shock pumps can be used to fill Schrader tubes (and ultra rare Schrader tubeless valves), they generally have a very low volume stroke and are inefficient for use with tires. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-gravel-bike-tires/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Gravel Bike Tires buyer's guide lead image\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Bike-Tires-Lead-Shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Gravel Bike Tires of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-road-bike-tires/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"1372\" height=\"915\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage.jpeg\" alt=\"A collage photo of road bike tires included in our buyers guide\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage.jpeg 1372w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Tires of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-pump/\">The Best Bike Pumps of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Paul Clauss","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f66aa2abcb8081f00844b0b6ebc89c3e03e9326419f7727894804421d52894a2","category":"Cycling"}
