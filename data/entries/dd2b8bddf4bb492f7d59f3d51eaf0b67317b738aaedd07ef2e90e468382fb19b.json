{"title":"Nilay Patel: ‘A Vote for Donald Trump Is a Vote for School Shootings and Measles’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/24282022/kamala-harris-endorsement-presidential-election-2024","date":1730769240000,"content":"\n<p>Nilay Patel, endorsing Kamala Harris at The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But look beyond the locked-in message discipline to her approach\nto campaigning, and it is clear Harris is deeply, meaningfully\ncommitted to <em>solving collective action problems</em>. She has\nassembled a politically diverse group of people to support her\nthat range from AOC to Liz Cheney to Mark Cuban, and most of her\nclaims about how she’ll run the country differently than Biden\ncome down to putting Republicans in her Cabinet and reaching\nacross the aisle more. She has, for better or worse, made\napproaches to the crypto community while championing restrictions\non price gouging and regulations on banks. She had antimonopoly\nSenator Elizabeth Warren onstage at the Democratic National\nConvention while having Google antitrust defense lawyer Karen Dunn\nserve as her debate advisor.</p>\n\n<p>You might not agree with some of the depressingly averaged-out\npolicy positions produced by this unnervingly big tent. You might\nhave some serious problems with, say, her proximity to the current\nadministration and its approach to the war in Gaza. But this is\nwhat happens when the other party in our two-party system can only\ngenerate policy ideas that amount to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24243021/springfield-ohio-haitians-ai-generated-misinformation-trump\">AI-generated blood\nlibel</a> and RETVRN memes on X. Trump and the MAGA movement\nhave stripped the Republican Party of the ability to govern\ndemocratically, so that process has moved inside the Harris\ncoalition.</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, the ecstatic reaction to Harris is simply a\nreflection of the fact that she is so clearly <em>trying</em>. She is\ntrying to govern America the way it’s designed to be governed,\nwith consensus and conversation and effort. With data and\naccountability, ideas and persuasion. Legislatures and courts are\nnot deterministic systems with predictable outputs based on a set\nof inputs — you have to guide the process of lawmaking all the\nway to the outcomes, over and over again, each time, and Harris\nseems not only aware of that reality but <em>energized</em> by it. More\nthan anything, that is the change a Harris administration will\nbring to a country exhausted by decades of fights about whether\ngovernment can or should do anything at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I still see some friends on the left who are uneasy with Liz Cheney’s full-throated endorsement of Harris. And even more so by her father’s. Back in September, when Liz Cheney declared her endorsement of Harris, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/04/cheney-harris\">I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But (lowercase ‘d’) democratic politics ought to be viewed very\nmuch like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</a> are in psychology.\nSome things matter more than others. And nothing — not climate\nchange or the environment, not reproductive rights, and certainly\nnot fucking tax rates — nothing matters more than support for\ndemocracy itself and the rule of law. The only way we’re going to\nget those other things right — which are really, really important — is through democratic governance and the rule of law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everyone who supports democracy, who understands the stakes, who sees who Trump is with clear eyes, is on one side in this election. That side is with Kamala Harris. It certainly makes for some strange bedfellows on the sort of policy disagreements most U.S. elections are waged over. It is terrifying and depressing that so many Americans are seemingly on the other side. But make no mistake, those are the stakes.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/04/nilay-patel-endorsement\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dd2b8bddf4bb492f7d59f3d51eaf0b67317b738aaedd07ef2e90e468382fb19b","category":"Tech"}
