But while we’re used to seeing riders switch frames for the pavé, the rest of Deignan’s build was less familiar.</p>\n<p>These images show Deignan’s bike straight from the finish line, caked in mud from the 17 <em>secteurs</em> of cobbles. Deignan, a former winner of the Tour of Flanders, attacked on the first section of pavé to take a dominant win, staying clear for more than 80km.</p>\n<h2>1x for the Hell of the North</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Fresh from the finish line: Lizzie Deignan’s Roubaix-winning Trek Domane SLR.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jacob Kennison</i></span></div>\n<p>Disc brakes may now be standard in professional cycling, and we expect every team in Sunday’s men’s race to use discs following <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/team-ineos-grenadiers-disc-brakes/\">Ineos-Grenadiers’ move away from rim brakes</a>, but 1x drivetrains have failed to have a significant impact on the road outside of time trials (and a failed experiment by the Aqua Blue Sport men’s team in 2018).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A 50-tooth 1x drivetrain for Deignan’s Domane.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jacob Kennison</i></span></div>\n<p>However, Deignan’s Trek-Segafredo women’s team opted for a 1x setup for Roubaix, pairing a 50-tooth front chainring (fitted with a Quarq power meter) with a 12-speed 10-33t cassette and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">SRAM’s wireless electronic Red eTap AXS</a> rear derailleur.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s Red eTap AXS provided 12-speed shifting across the cassette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jacob Kennison</i></span></div>\n<p>With the 116k Paris-Roubaix Femmes predominantly played out over flat roads, Deignan had little need for a front derailleur, though the British rider had a K-Edge chain catcher in place to provide some additional security over the harsh cobbles.</p>\n<h2>The tide is turning for tubeless</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Could the 2021 editions of Paris-Roubaix be where tubeless tyres really make their mark on the pro peloton?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>As for tyre choice, the 2021 editions of Paris-Roubaix could be the races where <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> truly make their mark at road cycling’s top table.</p>\n<p>Professional cyclists have used tubular tyres since the dawn of time, with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubular-tricks-and-stones-paris-roubaix-tech-at-the-tour-de-france/\">handmade Dugast and FMB tubular tyres a common sight at the cobbled Classics in years gone by</a>, but that commitment is beginning to show signs of waning.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Deignan used a chain catcher to provide some additional security over the cobbles.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Julian Alaphilippe won last weekend’s men’s World Championship road race on clincher tyres and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tubes</a> – his Deceuninck-QuickStep team have been using clinchers through the 2021 season – and tubeless tyres will see widespread use across this weekend’s Roubaix races, both in Saturday’s Femmes edition and Sunday’s men’s race to come.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is the third iteration of Trek’s Domane Classics bike.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Deignan’s Bontrager Aeolus RSL 37 wheels were fitted with 30mm-wide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/pirelli-p-zero-race-tlr-28mm-tyre-review/\">Pirelli P-Zero Race TLR tyres</a>, providing additional comfort and flat protection over the cobbles, as well as the opportunity to run lower pressures in the slick conditions.</p>\n<h2>Blips on the bars, but no blips for Deignan</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Deignan used SRAM’s blip buttons for quick shifts from the tops – but there were no blips on her march to victory in Roubaix.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jacob Kennison</i></span></div>\n<p>Other notable features of Deignan’s bike include SRAM’s blip shifters on the handlebar – allowing for quick shifts from the tops, where riders normally prefer to place their hands when bouncing over the pavé – and a Wahoo Elemnt Bolt computer.</p>\n<p>Details of the key cobbled sections are taped to the 2015 world champion’s stem, with the hydraulic hoses running underneath for a semi-integrated setup.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lucky number 13 for Deignan.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jacob Kennison</i></span></div>\n<p>Trek’s Domane frame is more familiar than the rest of the build but still well worth mentioning, having been used to great effect in the Classics since it was <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/trek-domane-a-new-bike-for-the-cobbled-classics/\">first launched in 2012</a>.
