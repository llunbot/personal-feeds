You remember we covered their new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wilde-rambler-sl-affordable-all-purpose-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Rambler SL back in April</a>. Anywho, he was displaying a new Gravel Bike with an amazing paint job by <a href=\"https://www.nyfpaint.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NYF Paint</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the kicker, the new gravel bike was built on a lugged steel frame… but, with modern gravel geometry and modern features. Jeff was telling me that this new lug set was designed by Chris Bishop of Bishop Bikes and is solely designed for the purpose of building a lugged gravel bike with modern geometry. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Lugged Wilde Gravel Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Lugged Gravel Bike in the booth\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-in-the-booth-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

The downtube-to-headtube lug is steeper, allowing for a taller fork and lower bottom bracket height. The show bike was equipped with Wilde Bikes’ own Wayfinder Carbon fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its top tube lugs are available with the option to run a horizontal top tube or a 5-degree sloping top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Lugged Gravel Bike headbadge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-headbadge-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This bike is such a cool blend of modern and that classic “skinny frame tubes and chrome lugs” of the old Italian frames of yesteryear. Then blending that look with modern geometry made this bike one of my favorites of the show… throw in the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jengreenheadbadges/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Jen Green</a>, sterling silver head badge and it completes the complete classiness of this bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Lugged Gravel Bike rear dropouts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-rear-dropouts-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Lugged Gravel Bike bottom bracket lug\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-bottom-bracket-lug-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, so shiny!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech Specifications and Retail Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Lugged Gravel Bike Sim Works stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-Sim-Works-stem-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Jeffery, this bike will retail for a $3500 frameset price with a standard painted finish. We’d call that a steal for this gorgeous bike.<br />Or why not go all out, for $5500 to get this amazing show finish – in real chrome and subtly sparkling paint. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Lugged Gravel Bike seat stay top tube junction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-seat-stay-top-tube-junction-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Lugged Gravel Bike chrome lugs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wilde-Bikes-Lugged-Gravel-Bike-chrome-lugs-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This show bike was AXS wireless specific and could fit a 700x45c rear tire, and up to a 700x 2.1″ up front. It was built up with White Industries hubs and headset, Sim Works bar &amp; stem, and a complete SRAM Red AXS drivetrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My photos don’t really do the bike justice, the bike was beautiful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the other offerings by Wilde Bikes below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>WildeBikes.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/made-show-wildes-lugged-gravel-bike-with-modern-geometry/\">MADE Show: Wilde’s Lugged Gravel Bike with Modern Geometry</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"417a5fb1c1d770efa848642e051e4799575c83ee7e9d0858449c4b0f5dbf7d3f","category":"Cycling"}
