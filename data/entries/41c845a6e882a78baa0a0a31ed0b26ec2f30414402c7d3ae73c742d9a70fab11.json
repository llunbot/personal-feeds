That’s right, three, roads so off the charts that you simply have to see them to believe them.”</p>\n<p>For the latest episode of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/listen-to-bikeradar-podcast/\">BikeRadar Podcast</a>, Simon picks out six must-ride climbs from the 100 found in his book.</p>\n<p>From the highest road in Europe to detours to Mallorca and the Canary Islands, the author takes listeners on a whistlestop tour of Spain’s greatest ascents.</p>\n\n<p>You can listen to the podcast above or read on for the six entries from Simon’s book.</p>\n<p>You can also purchase a signed <em>100 Great Cycling Climbs of Spain: A Guide to the Famous Cycling Mountains of Mainland Spain, Mallorca and the Canary Islands </em>from <a href=\"https://www.100climbs.co.uk/product-page/100-greatest-cycling-climbs-of-spain\" target=\"_blank\">100climbs.com</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>1) Alto de l’Angliru, Northern Spain</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Alto de l'Angliru, Spain\" title=\"Alto de l'Angliru, Spain\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Alto de l’Angliru has established itself as one of the hardest climbs in professional cycling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>valea / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>I first rode this beast in the autumn of 2014. Full of bravado, I hit its slopes armed with a 39 at the front and a 28 at the back and it duly pulled my pants down and spanked me. Never before had I been beaten by a mountain and had to do the walk of shame, but never before had I come up against a foe as mighty as the Angliru.</p>\n<p>Leaving La Vega, the first few kilometres are relatively tame, and they are followed by a short levelling and descent. Following this, however, the madness begins. Hitting you in waves, the sections of stupid-steep 20 per cent plus gradient suck the very marrow out of your bones.</p>\n<p>One of these savage stretches of gradient you could cope with, it’s just all of them added together that keeps punching you until you can’t take any more.

Utterly perfect. Well, almost.</p>\n<p>The first tip for riding Sa Calobra is to get there early, especially if it’s your intention to put down a fast time, because by mid-morning the coaches will be starting to arrive, ferrying tourists to the fishing village at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Blocking the hairpins and polluting the air, they are annoying, but without them and the visitors they carry, we would not have what is regarded by many as the ultimate cycling climb.</p>\n<p>Just shy of 10 kilometres long, this magnificent tangle of tarmac twists its way from shore to sky through the simply exquisite rocky landscape.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The famous serpentine road to Sa Colabra beach in Mallorca\" title=\"famous serpentine road to Sa Colabra beach\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The road snakes its way down the mountain, requiring the rider to descend before climbing back up.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Lichtwolke</i></span></div>\n<p>To ride it you must, of course, descend first, so on your way down you can marvel at its beauty and the genius of its construction. Then, after arriving at the base, turn right round and smash it back up.</p>\n<p>Almost faultless from start to finish, there are two more features, one natural and one man-made, that embellish the road even further.</p>\n<p>First, after two kilometres, you come to the famous narrowing as the road squeezes between two giant rock faces. Then, within a kilometre of the summit, you reach the 360-degree corner where the road loops round and passes over itself before the final push for the summit, which, to be geographically correct, is the Coll dels Reis.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simon Warren’s rating:</strong> 6/10</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 9.7km</li>\n<li><strong>Summit altitude:</strong> 723m</li>\n<li><strong>Height gain:</strong> 667m</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum gradient:</strong> 11%</li>\n<li><strong>Average gradient:</strong> 6.9%</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3) Alto del Gamoniteiro, Northern Spain</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Screengrab showing Alto del Gamoniteiro climb in Simon Warren's book, 100 Greatest Cycling Climbs in Spain\" title=\"Screengrab showing Alto del Gamoniteiro climb in Simon Warren's book, 100 Greatest Cycling Climbs in Spain\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Simon Warren’s latest book details the 100 greatest climbs in Spain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>100 Climbs</i></span></div>\n<p>First on everyone’s list for riding in Asturias is naturally the Angliru, as that’s the really famous climb. But what if I was to tell you that there is an even better ascent just a few miles south?</p>\n<p>Sharing what is essentially the same mountain, the road to Alto del Gamoniteiro may not be quite as tough as the Angliru, but it’s totally mind-blowing and I’d say one of the three most beautiful climbs I have ever ridden.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to start: either heading east on the AS-230 from Bárzana, or – the best way – riding west from Pola de Lena. The first part is essentially the climb to the Alto de la Cobertoria on an immaculate winding road, which pretty much climbs at a constant 10 per cent for almost nine kilometres. OUCH.</p>\n<p>Before you reach the summit of La Cobertoria though, you take the right turn off the main carriageway and into the primitive landscape that covers this mountain. The road, now a sliver of tarmac, often rough and periodically broken, creeps across the rocky scenery in search of its summit.</p>\n<p>Starting on a 10 per cent gradient and never relenting, it becomes incrementally harder as it climbs. Faced with prolonged bursts of 15 and even 17 per cent gradient towards the top, progress is slow, but such are your surroundings you could ride this road for eternity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simon Warren’s rating:</strong> 10/10</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 16.4km</li>\n<li><strong>Summit altitude:</strong> 1,683m</li>\n<li><strong>Height gain:</strong> 1,293m</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum gradient:</strong> 11%</li>\n<li><strong>Average gradient:</strong> 4.6%</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4) La Bola del Mundo, Sistema Central</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Transmitting antennas of radio and television in La Bola del Mundo mountain..

Home to a myriad of astronomical observatories, the mountaintop looks like the set of a 1980s Bond movie, and, taking the left turn, you wind up the final four kilometres between the huge galactic listening devices until you reach the car park at the top of the world.</p>\n<p>BEYOND EPIC.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simon Warren’s rating:</strong> 11/10</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 41.5km</li>\n<li><strong>Summit altitude:</strong> 2,426m</li>\n<li><strong>Height gain:</strong> 2,422m</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum gradient:</strong> 15%</li>\n<li><strong>Average gradient:</strong> 5.7%</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6) Pico Veleta, Andalucia</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The ski pistes and the road up to Pico del Veleta, Sierra Nevada, Andalusia, Spain\" title=\"The ski pistes and the road up to Pico del Veleta, Sierra Nevada, Andalusia, Spain\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pico Veleta is in the Sierra Nevada mountains of southern Spain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Why do billionaires spend all that money building rockets to reach ‘nearly space’ when all they actually need to do is get on their bikes?</p>\n<p>The previous high point I had cycled to was the Cime de la Bonette, at 2,860 metres.
