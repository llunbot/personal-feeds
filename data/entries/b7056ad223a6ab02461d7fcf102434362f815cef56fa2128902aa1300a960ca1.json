The upgrade should allow the camera to capture more light, resulting in enhanced photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models already have a 48-megapixel Main camera that uses \"pixel binning\" to merge data from four pixels on the sensor into one \"super pixel\" for improved low-light capture. With the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models, this technology is expected to expand to the Ultra Wide lens, which is currently a 12-megapixel lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis also means that ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models should be able to shoot <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-14-pro-take-48-megapixel-proraw-photos/\">48-megapixel ProRAW photos</a> in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, International Securities analyst Jeff Pu <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/\">claimed</a> that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ will feature a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera. Just a few months later, further details about Apple's plan for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/iphone-16-pro-rumored-to-feature-48mp-ultra-wide/\">Ultra Wide camera upgrade</a> emerged on Chinese social media site Weibo. With Kuo now throwing his weight behind the rumor, the upgrade seems highly likely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17 Pro is expected to complete the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors, bringing the technology <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/\">to the Telephoto lens</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo added that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ is on-track to feature the tetraprism Telephoto camera introduced on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. Kuo also said that the ‌iPhone‌ 17 lineup will feature an upgraded front-camera camera unit <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/\">with a 24-megapixel sensor</a> and a six-element lens.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/iphone-16-pros-ultra-wide-camera-major-upgrade/\">iPhone 16 Pro's Ultra Wide Camera Rumored to Receive Major Upgrade</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pros-ultra-wide-camera-rumored-to-receive-major-upgrade.2415420/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b7056ad223a6ab02461d7fcf102434362f815cef56fa2128902aa1300a960ca1","category":"Apple"}
