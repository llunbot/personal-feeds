What if their claims of unparalleled fit, power output boost thanks to perfectly efficient power transfer, and even decrease lactate build-up are true? Then, a competitive cyclist would have to at least consider them, right?

The structural relationship between these two parts provides the most direct energy transfer possible and is a first for any type of footwear, and is only enabled by true customization. Traditional shoes with soft uppers fail to effectively capture dorsal inputs; energy is bled off before it can be translated to the pedal. Superior power transfer has been obvious to testers and early pro users.
