The company tends to hold a March or April <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-2023-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring event</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a> in June, an event to celebrate the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">iPhone launch in September</a>, and a late fall event in October at which it has been known to release new iPads and Macs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple just introduced the new iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 at an event on September 12. Has the company finished releasing new products for 2023? There is still a chance we could see the launch of new Macs and iPads at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple event</a> in October, but it is possible that Apple will not hold an event to introduce any more <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new products</a> in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will Apple hold an October event in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years Apple has held a second fall event in October or November, where it has launched new Macs, iPads, and AirPods. For example, at the 2021 Unleashed event we got the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the third-gen AirPods, while the previous year brought the M1 versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as you can see from the list of October event dates below, Apple does not always hold an October event. Over the past 12 years, Apple has held eight October events, so it’s not unprecedented to skip it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2022: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 13</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Thursday, October 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: Thursday, October 16</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: Tuesday, October 22</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Tuesday, October 23</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2011: Tuesday, October 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2023 is not looking like a year in which Apple will hold an October event. While there is a possibility that the company could launch a new iPad mini and an M3 version of the iMac, both of which have at some point been rumored for this year, neither would warrant the attention of an event. It is more likely that any Apple product updates still to come in 2023 will do so in the form of a press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When could Apple’s October event be held?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple does surprise us with an October event in 2023 we’d anticipate that it would fall around October 17 or 24. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invitations usually go out one to two weeks before the event is held, so if the event will happen then expect invites to arrive around the beginning of October. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the October event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple has an October event, we know for sure that it will start at 10 am PT. Here’s what that translates to in other countries around the world (if the event happens later in the month there may be some changes due to clock changes):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>US: 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), 12 pm (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: As above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UK: 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: 7 pm (CET/CEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Following day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: Following day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s special events usually last between one and two hours. If you want to watch the October event live, Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">stream the keynote</a> on its website and YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will Apple launch in October?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether there’s an event or not, we it is possible that Apple could unveil new Macs and iPads. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M3 iMac </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iMac is still running an M1 chip while the rest of the lineup is now on the second generation of Apple’s Mac chips, so it’s well overdue an update. The rumors suggest that the iMac will move straight to the M3 chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">M3 iMac rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Air with M3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple launches an M3 iMac we could also see an update to the MacBook Air. But we think this would come too soon after the June launch of the 15-inch MacBook Air, so we aren’t holding our breath. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>13-inch MacBook Pro with M3 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Only because it would be strange if Apple didn’t update the 13-inch MacBook Pro at the same time as the Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini was last updated in 2021. A seventh-generation model could be coming in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10th-generation iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831865/10th-generation-ipad-october-event-design-display-colors.html\"> biggest release</a> of October could Apple’s cheapest iPad, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678387/complete-guide-to-the-new-ipad-10-2in-for-2022.html\">10.2-inch entry-level model</a>. Rumors suggest this model could get a redesign with slimmer bezels, a larger 10.5-inch screen, USB-C, and 5G. It might also be losing the headphone jack. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bigger iPad Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There could also be a new iPad Pro, with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro</a> rumored. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods Lite</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AirPods Lite have been rumored for some time. Said to cost $99 they could be huge this Christmas, if they ever emerge. The AirPods Max also need an update. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What did Apple launch at its last October event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 18, 2021, Apple launched redesigned models of the high-end MacBook Pro, with a 14-inch and 16-inch models making their debut. Powering the new MacBooks were the high-end M1 Pro and M1 Max chips that built on the already impressive M1 chips that arrived in November 2020. The laptops received new designs with slim bezels and extra ports, including MagSafe, HDMI, and an SD card slot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That event also saw Apple unveil the third-generation AirPods, new HomePod mini colors, and a cheaper, Siri-powered Apple Music subscription, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678309/apple-music-voice-plan-vs-apple-music-the-differences.html\">Apple Music Voice</a>.
