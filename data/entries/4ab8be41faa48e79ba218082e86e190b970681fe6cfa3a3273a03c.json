In <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on\">a recent interview with Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Valve designer Lawrence Yang says it will be \"a few years\" before the company releases \"a true next-gen Deck with a significant bump in horsepower.\"</p>\n<p>A look at the Steam Deck's performance <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/\">over its first year of availability</a> helps show why Valve might not be in a hurry to release a more powerful portable. The current Steam Deck now supports <a href=\"https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified\">over 8,000 titles that are either rated Playable or Verified</a> by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/valves-deck-verified-badge-will-show-which-games-run-well-on-steam-deck/\">Valve's official Compatibility program</a>. And that list isn't just low-end indie games, either; heavy hitters like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/how-valve-made-steam-deck-the-first-pc-to-smoothly-run-elden-ring/\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and the recent <em>Dead Space</em> remake run great on the handheld, and the device can <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/steam-decks-future-proofed-potential-borne-out-by-ray-tracing-tests/\">even handle ray tracing</a> on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/steam/?emclan=103582791470414830&amp;emgid=3650768394042637389\">slightly older games like <em>Doom Eternal</em></a>.</p>\n<p>That said, the Steam Deck hardware is already beginning to show its age on some recent releases. Games like <em>Wild Hearts</em> and <em>Returnal</em> will technically run on the Deck but <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/returnal/steam-deck\">reportedly</a> show some significant <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/wild-hearts/steam-deck\">frame rate and performance issues</a> on the portable. While future software or OS patches could help a bit for these bleeding-edge games, the Steam Deck's unchanging hardware may start to look increasingly dated as PC gamers continue to upgrade their rigs with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/nvidias-excess-inventory-means-the-gpu-shortage-is-officially-a-gpu-surplus/\">plentiful graphics cards</a> (and PC game makers continue to target those high-end desktop users with their newest titles).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922721#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922721&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4ab8be41faa48e79ba218082e86e190b970681fe6cfa3a3273a03c","category":"Tech"}
