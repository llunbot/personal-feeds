{"title":"Before the new version, let’s revisit 1984’s Dune—the greatest movie ever made","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802795","date":1634497218000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi novel <em>Dune</em> gets a new film adaptation—this one helmed by Denis Villeneuve (<em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/arrival-proves-that-first-contact-movies-can-still-blow-your-mind/\">Arrival</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-review-a-wonderful-step-forward-into-the-past/\">Blade Runner 2049</a></em>)—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/latest-dune-trailer-gives-us-our-best-look-yet-at-denis-villeneuves-epic-film/\">later this month</a>. But before Ars Technica reviews the movie, there's the matter of its predecessor: 1984's <em>Dune</em>, made by a then up-and-coming filmmaker named David Lynch.</p>\n<p>Detractors call Lynch's saga—a tale of two noble space families 8,000 years in the future, fighting over the most valuable resource in the universe amidst sandworms the size of aircraft carriers—incomprehensible, stilted, and ridiculous. It lost piles of money. Yet fans, especially in recent years, have reclaimed Lynch's film as a magnificent folly, a work of holy, glorious madness.</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Beginning_1-980x416.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Lynch begins <em>Dune</em> where his previous film (<em>The Elephant Man</em>) ends: a starfield. The Emperor's daughter (Virginia Madsen of <em>Sideways</em>) fades in to bring us up to speed. She doesn't appear again for nearly 2 hours and, when she does, she doesn't say or do anything.

Both. Am I about to describe <em>Dune</em> as \"so bad it's good\"? No, that's a loser take for cowards.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802795#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802795&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Peter Opaskar","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"479cecab8d5953990dbce28038f510dff9481fbdbe5079b3eee789f1bec56da5","category":"Tech"}
