Wilmore and Williams launched June 5 aboard an Atlas V rocket and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-drama-filled-day-boeings-starliner-finally-finds-its-way/\">docked at the station the next day</a>, completing the first segment of Starliner's first test flight with astronauts.</p>\n<p>NASA managers originally planned for the Starliner spacecraft to remain docked at the space station for at least eight days, although they left open the possibility of a mission extension. The test flight is now likely to last at least a month and a half, and perhaps longer, as engineers wrestle with helium leaks and thruster glitches on Starliner's service module.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034431#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034431&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0854abb35a04fcbf701c4d8399384230fc8354c794932c3c31f8c1e2cf6f33b9","category":"Tech"}
