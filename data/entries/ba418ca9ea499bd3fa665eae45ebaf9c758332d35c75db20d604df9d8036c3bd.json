When asked to picture a '90s-or-newer Mercedes full-size sedan, it's hard not to conjure up mental snapshots of W124-and-up generations schlepping around well-heeled suburban communities. I bet a lot of folks also picture the taxi lineup outside any German train station, too.</p>\n<p>Well, at least I do. But I'm not talking about envisioning surly Munich cabbies but rather the faithful four-doors they putter around in. A lot of them are E Classes, which further proves that the cars have always been quintessential Mercedes luxury workhorses.</p>\n<p>The brand-new 2024 E 350 4Matic, with its thrifty turbo-four powerplant, might have the most direct lineage in the US market to those cream-colored rickety diesels. It's easy on fuel for its size and ready to soak up all the miles across both traffic-ridden cityscapes and high-speed stretches of highway. And with its expansive suite of tech and mild hybrid propulsion, it's an overall great next chapter for the badge.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018186#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018186&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ba418ca9ea499bd3fa665eae45ebaf9c758332d35c75db20d604df9d8036c3bd","category":"Tech"}
