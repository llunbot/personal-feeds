We let it\nexist. And I should take the blame for that, because I was the guy\narguing for that for a long time. But I didn’t know — and this is\nmy fault — the extent that they were profiting off of our API.\nThat these were not charities.</p>\n\n<p>The ones that actually are doing good for our users — RedReader,\nDystopia, Luna — like actually adding real value at their own\ncost? We’ve exempted. We’ll carry that cost.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Peters:</strong> <em>I want to stop you for a second there. So you’re\nsaying that Apollo, RIF, Sync, they don’t add value to Reddit?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Huffman:</strong> Not as much as they take. No way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Either you see the value of a great user experience or you don’t. No surprise that the CEO of a company whose website is so bad that they’ve had to keep <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/\">the old one</a> around as an alternative doesn’t see the value Apollo adds to the Reddit experience.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/16/peters-huffman-interview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"307716f8eb9fa272043fd69bc1b8b920e0a59237a829dab9a0d991d352879cba","category":"Tech"}
