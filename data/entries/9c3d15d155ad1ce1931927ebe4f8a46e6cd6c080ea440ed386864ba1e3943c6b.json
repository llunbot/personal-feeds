These same benefits would extend to a future Vision Pro that adopts the technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how Apple described the iPad Pro's tandem OLED technology:<blockquote>The Ultra Retina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No other device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem OLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the colour and luminance of each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. Specular highlights in photos and video appear even brighter, and there's more detail in shadows and low light than ever before on iPad â€” all while delivering even more responsiveness to content in motion.</blockquote>The current Vision Pro is equipped with two 4K micro-OLED displays supplied by Sony.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, the technology now exists for the next-generation Vision Pro to feature even brighter and more power efficient displays in a few years from now.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/vision-pro-tandem-oled-report/\">iPad Pro's Tandem OLED Display Tech Could Extend to Future Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pros-tandem-oled-display-tech-could-extend-to-future-vision-pro.2432610/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c3d15d155ad1ce1931927ebe4f8a46e6cd6c080ea440ed386864ba1e3943c6b","category":"Apple"}
