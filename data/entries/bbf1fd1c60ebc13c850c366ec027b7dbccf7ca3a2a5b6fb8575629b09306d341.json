The announcement comes as Comcast has been rapidly losing cable TV subscribers to streaming services and seeks to bring the same type of bundling that originally drew people away from cable to streaming.</p>\n<p>Starting on an unspecified date this month, the bundle, called Streamsaver, will offer Peacock, which Comcast owns, Apple TV+, and Netflix to people who subscribe to Comcast's cable TV and/or broadband. Comcast already offers Netflix or Apple TV+ as add-ons to its cable TV, but Streamsaver expands Comcast's streaming-related bundling efforts.</p>\n<p>Comcast didn't say how much the streaming bundle would cost, but CEO Brian Roberts said that it will “come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today\" when announcing the bundle on Tuesday at MoffettNathanson’s 2024 Media, Internet and Communications Conference in New York, per <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/peacock-netflix-apple-tv-plus-bundle-streaming-comcast-1236002375/\">Variety</a>. If we factor in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/all-the-ways-streaming-services-are-aggravating-their-subscribers-this-week/\">Peacock's upcoming price hike</a>, subscribing to Apple TV+, Netflix, and Peacock separately would cost $39.47 per month without ads, or $24.97/month with ads.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024632#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024632&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbf1fd1c60ebc13c850c366ec027b7dbccf7ca3a2a5b6fb8575629b09306d341","category":"Tech"}
