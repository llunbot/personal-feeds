The “Mixed” refers to its capability of mixed surface types and conditions, and the T50 means it’s rated for moderate terrain. It sits between the Terreno Dry and current Mezcal models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-6.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-6.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria terreno mixed T50 gravel bike tires shown with black and brown sidewalls.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-6.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-6-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-6-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-6-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The “T” rating system goes from 0 (smooth asphalt) to 100 (the worst chunk you can imagine), so theT50 rating means these are for normal gravel roads with a few washboards, potholes, and rocks thrown in with smooth hardpacked sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spectrum of conditions terminology includes hardpack, fine loose, mixed, coarse loose, and mud.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2425\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria terreno mixed T50 gravel bike tires shown from various angles.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4.jpg 2425w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4-1536x1013.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4-768x507.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-4-2048x1351.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It gets a new tread pattern with a directional siping texture that works in conjunction with the directional edges of the knobs to give you fast-rolling straight line performance but also better grip in the corners. Center lugs are shorter, getting taller and bigger as you get to the reinforced side lugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rubber compound on the outside is grippier than the Terreno model this replaces, but is slightly slower rolling. Combined, the new tread pattern and rubber gives you a bit more grip at the expense of a bit more rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Terreno Mixed T50 comes in their standard “Endurance” level tires for enthusiast riders. There’s also a “Race” level that sets their top-tier casings and construction apart, and for some reason it’s the Terreno Mixed Pro T60, and not the Terreno Mixed Race T60. So, remember, “Pro” on the hot patch means it’s a “Race” level tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the difference between Endurance and Race?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-tire-construction-endurance.jpg\"><img width=\"1884\" height=\"1460\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-tire-construction-endurance.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-tire-construction-endurance.jpg 1884w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-tire-construction-endurance-297x230.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-tire-construction-endurance-1536x1190.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-tire-construction-endurance-120x93.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-tire-construction-endurance-768x595.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The two levels of tire vary by materials and echnical differences in construction:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vittoria Endurance gravel tires</strong><br />• More protection than Race (technically the same casing as current tires)<br />• Casing: Nylon 120 TPI<br />• Anti-puncture: Anti-puncture belt + sidewall stability insert<br />• Compound: 1C Graphene<br />• Sidewall colors: black for all sizes &amp; brown in 40/45mm only</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vittoria Race gravel tires</strong> (coming later this year)<br />• 92% renewable &amp; recycled content<br />• Designed to be the absolute fastest option from point A to point B<br />• Upgrades to a more supple, multi-layer organic cotton casing<br />• More anti-puncture reinforcements with natural latex, recycled nylon sidewall protection, and anti-puncture belt<br />• Race rubber compound formulation<br />• Natural brown sidewall color</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-2.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria terreno mixed T50 gravel bike tires in retail packaging.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vittoria-terreno-mix-t50-gravel-bike-tires-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Endurance tires cost €54.95 and Race, when they come out, will cost €84.95.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.vittoria.com/blogs/magazine/terreno-t50\" target=\"_blank\">Vittoria.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/vittoria-gravel-tires-get-terrain-scores-and-new-naming/\">Vittoria Gravel Tires get “Terrain Scores” and New Naming</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b4823b3ec548d36789b30bd1368cd3f832baad7357e6e10eacf06146ef78916a","category":"Cycling"}
