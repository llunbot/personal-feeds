Today, the multinational company with more than 200,000 employees worldwide ranks among the 10 largest motor vehicle manufacturers in the world. Increasingly, Honda says it sees itself as less of an automobile company, and more of a \"mobility\" company, said Keiji Ohtsu, president of Honda's Research and Development Company.</p>\n<p>Honda's various companies now build a broad range of products, including automobiles, motorcycles, robots, and jets. Because of this diverse portfolio, Honda has developed a broad range of fluid and combustion technologies, as well as guidance and control systems. Ohtsu, speaking with two reporters via Microsoft Teams on Thursday evening, said he has overseen the development of engines for a number of Honda vehicles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808734#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808734&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b9d75c60ce2094f790c7f5ded2b2e61d950abf54b209e1d4232209ce593c897","category":"Tech"}
