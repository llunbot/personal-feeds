John Hyten, the vice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, have been discussing for more than a year whether to reveal a secret space weapon by providing a demonstration of its capabilities, the report says. The weapon system, the details of which remain obscure, was developed as a \"Special Access Program,\" which is reserved for highly classified information.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration considered revealing the space weapon as early as the annual Space Symposium conference in 2020, a prestigious event for the national defense community. The idea was to showcase the technology as a validation of the Space Force and Space Command, which is responsible for military operations in outer space. However, the conference was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789095#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789095&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"07f4e4748e2cf372fe6b2c8c87f432fa182971232728800dee65cb94a65daa66","category":"Tech"}
