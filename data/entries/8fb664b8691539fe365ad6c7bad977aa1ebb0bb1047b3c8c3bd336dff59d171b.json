We\nhear that to get the docs, outlets had to agree to the conditions\nand a schedule laid down by the PR team that worked on earlier\nleaked docs.</p>\n\n<p>A curated selection out of millions of documents at Facebook can\nin no way be used to draw fair conclusions about us. Internally,\nwe share work in progress and debate options. Not every suggestion\nstands up to the scrutiny we must apply to decisions affecting so\nmany people.</p>\n\n<p>To those news organizations who would like to move beyond an\norchestrated “gotcha” campaign, we are ready to engage on the\nsubstance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Casey Johnston:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>this tweet appears to contain words but all i hear are little baby\ncrying sounds? can you explain</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There was a time when “VP of communications for Facebook” sounded like a great job, I bet.
