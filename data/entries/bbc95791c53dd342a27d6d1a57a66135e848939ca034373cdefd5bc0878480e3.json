In the meantime, Intel has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/intel-social-experiment-pc-vs-mac-ad/\">run ads promoting Intel-based PCs over Macs</a>, and it even recruited actor Justin Long from Apple's iconic \"I'm a Mac\" ads for the campaign.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA replay of Apple's November 2020 event is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/#november-2020\">available on Apple's website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I\">on YouTube</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/apple-silicon-macs-one-year-anniversary/\">Today Marks the One Year Anniversary of the First Apple Silicon Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/today-marks-the-one-year-anniversary-of-the-first-apple-silicon-macs.2322738/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TOWY1atcthI:QMdcbhf4h6s:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TOWY1atcthI:QMdcbhf4h6s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bbc95791c53dd342a27d6d1a57a66135e848939ca034373cdefd5bc0878480e3","category":"Apple"}
