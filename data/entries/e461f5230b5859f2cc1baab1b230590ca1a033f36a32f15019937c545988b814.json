The Italian tire manufacturer is resurrecting the Fango tread. This limited edition offering will see only 100 tires created with the Fango tread in never-before-seen orange sidewalls. So, if you’ve been waiting patiently for the Fango to return from the dead (it is Halloween, after all). Scrape that old glue off your wheels, stretch your hands, and prepare for some tubular Fango action.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange side tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-side-tread-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Challenge Fango? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are newer to cyclocross or don’t follow tire trends as closely as this nerd, let me catch you up. The Challenge Fango is a unique tire that predates the most popular Challenge treads. It launched in 2008 and was supposed to be a direct competitor to the famous <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-cyclocross-tires-tubulars-tubeless-clinchers-for-every-condition/\">Dugast Rhino</a>, which ruled the mud seas then. After its unveiling, the Fango was met with excitement or disdain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-tread--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread is highly designed, with some touches that still make me scratch my head. But, you gotta remember, this was three years before the Limus, Baby Limus, and others. The Challenge catalog was limited, and the Fango was the mud tire. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Adam-Myerson-Fango--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1759\" height=\"1255\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Adam-Myerson-Fango--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Adam Myerson Fango\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Adam-Myerson-Fango--jpeg.webp 1759w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Adam-Myerson-Fango--297x212.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Adam-Myerson-Fango--1536x1096.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Adam-Myerson-Fango--120x86.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Adam-Myerson-Fango--768x548.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adammyerson/?hl=en\">Adam Myerson</a> racing the Challenge Fango at Gloucester in Oct, 2008.

But it turned out to be an amazing grass tire when you needed a little extra pedaling and braking traction going straight and more aggressive side knobs for leaning over in soft, but not necessarily muddy, turns. It was the perfect tire for New England-style tracks with a typical mix of fields and woods.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Myerson</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-logo--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge Fango Tread </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fango tread is unique, and there are certain instances in which the tire excels. <em>What is Its most defining feature? </em>That has to be Fango “scoop” in the center tread — 100%. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange down\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-down--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the center of the Fango tread, there is a long diamond shape with a scoop. The scoop has a rounded edge, unlike the flat, sharp edges we see on the Baby Limus and others. This scoop sheds mud but doesn’t dig into it for grip…so it’s an anomaly. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where Does the Fango Excel? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Fango pulls its weight is the sharp mid-cornering knobs. The outer edges are like the Grifo center tread but more of a “T” shape and vertical. A diamond staggered between the scoop for good and some mud-shedding capability. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange far shot full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-far-shot-full-bike--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as course application for the Fango, I echo the Myerson quote above. It’s a heavy grass tire. But like all tires, every tread isn’t for everyone. I like the Baby Limus for many courses, while others might pick the Grifo or even a Dune. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange front side spikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-front-side-spikes--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, tire choice can come down to personal preference and what gives you the most confidence on the course. A perfect course for the Fango would be a grass-heavy crit-style track with lots of high-speed corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange top side tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-top-side-tread--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge Fango Limited Edition Details </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conditions:</strong> Wet/Grass</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tire Type:</strong> Tubular Only</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Casing: </strong>Challenge Pro Edition 300 TPI</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Color:</strong> Limited Edition Orange </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 445g</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $100</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Availability: </strong>Now </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange full bike with tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike-with-tires--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride Impressions: Challenge Fango Limited Edition 33mm </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Fango came across my desk, Challenge hit me with a wave of nostalgia. I remember when this tire came out and I was very excited about it. I was running clinchers with latex tubes and more baby powder in the tire than is customary…it was 2008, and I needed all the help I could find. The Fango was my ticket to finally becoming a mudder…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-weight--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Remember When…</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t looked at the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/challenge-shows-historical-prototype-fango-teases-future-gravel-tire-development/\">Fango Tread </a>in a while, and seeing it now, I understand why the tire has some dedicated followers. It’s a sharp tire with many points and edges (excluding the center scoop). The sharp edges are lone and have no connecting knobs or bridging to others (like the Limus), so they flex independently and offer some suppleness and conforming in the tread. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange bike back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-bike-back--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Challenge Pro Edition casing has a limited edition orange sidewall. Challenge tires usually arrive in Red (Team Edition) Tan (Poly casing) or older Tan/White sidewalls that are years past Team Edition “S” (soft) tires. The orange (or Pumpkin Spice, as I’ve been calling it) colored side wall sticks out and looks fantastic amongst the turning leaves. It also stands out on the bike, and it is guaranteed to get you some <em>“What tires are you running?”</em> conversation starters at the course pre-ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange folded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-folded--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial thought about the tread is tire wear and how quickly those sharp knobs will dull on the pavement, but like we said – this is a grass/mud tire. It shouldn’t be hitting the tarmac for long sections and only for racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange detail side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-detail-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The second chevron (after the scooped one) is where the digging happens and where the grip and braking traction come from.

They glued up nicely, and I didn’t do much tire truing after the fact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the course (a grass-heavy chosen track), the Fangos were great. I wasn’t hitting every corner at race speed, but I could see that the tire had a place, and that place was wet (and early morning dew) grass. When pushing the speed, the Fango slides slightly and hooks up in very damp corners. In dry grass and damp dirt corners, the Fango grips and has enough purchase on the ground that you can sprint out of the turns with no slipping repercussions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange header\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-header--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On wide open, soggy, thick grass, there is no slippage or burning out; it’s all grip. The Fango is slightly squirmy while cornering on the pavement, but nothing over what most mud tires feel like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t have a chance to ride them in full-on natural mud (we’ve only had these for a hot second), but there is a quick point where they grip and then become slicks. Depending on the mud style (slick over hard, peanut butter, or mud soup), the Fango would perform the best in slick over hard. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Challenge Fango Limited Edition Orange full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Challenge-Fango-Limited-Edition-Orange-full-bike--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Would you Race the Fango? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, <em>but.</em> For cyclocross, part of the fun (and annoyance) is the equipment and piles of wheels and tires. Mounting and allocating a wheelset only for the Fango tread would be tough. If I had endless wheels, rotors, and cassettes all the same, ready to rock like a professional Belgian cycling outfit – yes, 100%. I would be happy to have them in my tire quiver. But thats not the case. I know my treads and what I like, and the Grifo and Baby Limus play better with my mountain bike style of bike driving and steering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, many riders feel the Fango is THE tread for them. That’s why there are so many tire options and combos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To those riders (and I know many), I say, “Get them while you can!” as this is a limited edition run and might be the last time you see the Fango. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.challengetires.com/?switched_country=true\">Challengetires.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/challenge-issues-100-tires-limited-edition-fango-tires-with-orange-sidewall/\">Exclusive: Challenge Issues 100 Limited Edition Fango Tires With Orange Sidewall </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e461f5230b5859f2cc1baab1b230590ca1a033f36a32f15019937c545988b814","category":"Cycling"}
