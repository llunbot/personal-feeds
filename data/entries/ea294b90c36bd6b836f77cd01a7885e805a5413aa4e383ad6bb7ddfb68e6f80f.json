Once we‚Äôve decided what UI components we use and when, we can avoid never-ending discussions, confusion, and misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs explore a few examples of <strong>decision trees for UI components</strong> and how we can get the most out of them.</p>\n\n\n<p>This article is <strong>part of our ongoing series</strong> on <a href=\"/category/design-patterns\">design patterns</a>.

Each shows an example of what a component looks like, but I would also add <strong>references to real-life UI examples and flows</strong> of where and how these components are used. A fantastic starting point that documents design decisions better than any guide would.</p>\nDecision Trees For UI Components: Workday\n<p>The team behind <a href=\"https://canvas.workday.com/\">Workday‚Äôs Canvas design system</a> created a fantastic set of design decision trees for notifications, errors and alerts, loading patterns, calls to action, truncation, and overflow ‚Äî with <strong>guidelines, examples, and use cases</strong>, which can now only be retrieved from the archive:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/decision-trees-ui-components/decision-trees-ui-components-workday.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240118144833/https://canvas.workday.com/patterns/notifications/#tab=usage\">Notifications Decision Tree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240229153559/https://canvas.workday.com/patterns/errors-and-alerts/#tab=usage\">Errors and Alerts Decision Tree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240118144613/https://canvas.workday.com/patterns/loading/#tab=usage\">Loading UX Decision Tree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240118144311/https://canvas.workday.com/patterns/calls-to-action/#tab=usage\">Calls to Action Decision Tree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240118144316/https://canvas.workday.com/patterns/overflow/#tab=usage\">Truncation and Overflow Decision Tree</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each decision tree, the Workday team has put together a few <strong>context-related questions</strong> to consider first when making a decision before even jumping into the decision tree. Plus, there are thorough examples for each option available, as well as a very detailed alternative text for every image.</p>\nForm Components Decision Tree: Lyft\n<p>A choice of a <strong>form component</strong> can often be daunting. When should you use radio buttons, checkboxes, or dropdowns? Runi Goswami from Lyft has <a href=\"https://medium.com/tap-to-dismiss/a-better-segmented-control-9e662de2ef57\">shared</a> a detailed form components decision tree that helps their team choose between form controls.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/decision-trees-ui-components/decision-tree-form-controls.png\" /></p>\n<p>We start by exploring whether a user can select more than one option in our UI. If it‚Äôs indeed multi-select, we use toggles for short options and checkboxes for longer ones.</p>\n<p>If only one option can be selected, then we use tabs for filtering, <strong>radios for shorter options</strong>, a switch for immediately applicable options, and a checkbox if only one option can be selected. Dropdowns are used as a last resort.</p>\nChoosing Onboarding Components: NewsKit\n<p>Onboarding comes in various forms and shapes. Depending on how <strong>subtle or prominent</strong> we want to highlight a particular feature, we can use popovers, badges, hints, flags, toasts, feature cards, or design a better empty state. The Newskit team has put together an <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1154730991789332817/choosing-onboarding-methods-and-components\">Onboarding Selection Prototype in Figma</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/decision-trees-ui-components/decision-toolkit-onboarding-ux.png\" /></p>\n<p>The choice depends on whether we want to <strong>interrupt</strong> the users to display details (usually isn‚Äôt very effective), <strong>show</strong> a feature subtly during the experience (more effective), or <strong>enable discovery</strong> by highlighting a feature within the context of a task a user tries to accomplish.</p>\n<p>The toolkit asks a designer a couple of questions about the <strong>intent of onboarding</strong>, and then suggests options that are likely to perform best ‚Äî a fantastic little helper for streamlined onboarding decisions.</p>\nDesign System Process Flowcharts: Nucleus\n<p>How do you decide to add a new component to a design system or rather extend an existing one? What‚Äôs the process for contributions, maintenance, and the overall design process? Some design teams <strong>codify their design decisions</strong> as design system process flowcharts, as shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/decision-trees-ui-components/design-system-maintenance-process.jpeg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://britishgas.design/guidelines/process/\">Contribution Process at British Gas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nordhealth.design/contributing/\">Contributing Guidelines at Nordhealth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.aviva.com/ion/start-your-project/processes.html\">Processes at Aviva</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.opencollective.com/help/contributing/design/contribution-guidelines\">Contribution Process at OpenCollective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/zalando-design/zalandos-design-system-contribution-model-73ab36f8591e\">Contribution Process at Zalando</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here are helpful decision trees for <strong>adding new components</strong> to a design system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNZBdYuA=/\">New Component Decision Tree at Boston Scientific</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://primer.style/guides/contribute/handling-new-patterns\">Handling New Patterns at GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-design-system-governance-process/\">Design System Governance Process</a> by Brad Frost</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/989121626983620108/new-component-decision-tree\">New Component Decision Tree</a> by Louis Ouriach</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1026922247130382011\">Design System Contribution Template</a> by Chad Bergman</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/razorpay-design/behind-the-scenes-of-designing-a-design-system-component-7969636fabf4\">How To Launch A New Component</a> + <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1042406919054488163\">Figma template</a> by Rama Krushna Behera</li>\n</ul>\nMake Decision Trees Visible\n<p>What I absolutely love about the decision tree approach is not only that it beautifully visualizes design decisions but that it also serves as a <strong>documentation</strong>. It establishes shared standards across teams and includes examples to follow, with incredible value for new hires.</p>\n<p>Of course, exceptions happen. But once you have codified the ways of working for design teams as a decision tree and made it front and center of your design work, it <strong>resolves never-ending discussions</strong> about UI decisions for good.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/decision-trees-ui-components/handling-new-patterns-github.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>So whenever a debate comes up, document your decisions in a decision tree. Turn them into posters. Place them in kitchen areas and developer‚Äôs and QA workspaces. Put them in design critique rooms. <strong>Make them visible</strong> where design work happens and where code is being written.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs worth mentioning that every project will need its own custom trees, so please see the examples above as an <strong>idea to build upon</strong> and customize away for your needs.</p>\nMeet Smart Interface Design Patterns\n<p>If you are interested in similar insights around UX, take a look at <a href=\"https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/\"><strong>Smart Interface Design Patterns</strong></a>, our <strong>10h-video course</strong> with 100s of practical examples from real-life projects ‚Äî with a live UX training later this year.
