From 62 km to go, there are two climbs virtually back to back. The Alto de San Jerónimo is 13 km at 3.3% and peaks at 49 km to go, and then there’s the “Alto del 14%” – 7.2 km at 5.6% which tops out at 19 km to go. From there, it’s downhill and then flat to the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for: </strong>Escartín predicts this stage will end in a sprint finish. That’s certainly a possibility (albeit from a reduced bunch). Don’t be surprised if this is a day for the breakaway though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks:</strong> <em>This feels like a really good opportunity for the more versatile fast finishers to get a win. BikeExchange should work hard for Michael Matthews, who looks like the top favorite for the stage. Andrea Bagioli, Matteo Trentin, and Andreas Kron are other picks, while Magnus Cort is a bit of a wildcard. The profile suits him, but he did just put in a lot of effort on stage 11.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-vuelta-profile-stage12.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stage12.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-12-of-the-vuelta-a-espana/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ddede165fd07117b3d4075f091455d95cf6f10de45e8b03e30e0f9c9e769cc22","category":"Cycling"}
