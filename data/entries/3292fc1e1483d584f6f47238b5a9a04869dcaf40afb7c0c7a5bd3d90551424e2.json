It can achieve speeds up to twice as fast as Thunderbolt 4, with bandwidth up to 120Gb/s available for display connections, and supports connecting up to three 8K displays at 60Hz with Display Stream Compression, making it suitable for demanding visual workflows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/OWC-thunderbolt-5-hub-back-right.jpg\" width=\"4989\" height=\"2506\" />\r<br />\nIn terms of charging output, the hub provides up to 140W power delivery, which is enough for a 16-inch MacBook Pro, while the aluminum enclosure features passive cooling for silent operation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOWC is keen to emphasize backward compatibility with Thunderbolt 3/4 and USB-C devices, allowing users to connect both newer and legacy peripherals. The hub also enables the creation of three separate device daisy chains that can operate independently.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/OWC-thunderbolt-5-hub-front-left.jpg\" width=\"4999\" height=\"2502\" /><blockquote>The OWC Thunderbolt 5 Hub opens a new world of workflow possibilities and performance with compact perfection.
