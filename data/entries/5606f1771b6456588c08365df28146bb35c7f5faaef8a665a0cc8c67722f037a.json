Apple will continue to work on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS14 Sonoma</a> into the summer of 2024 (at which point it will start work on macOS 15). If you are a member of Apple’s beta testing program you will be able to try out the new features before they arrive on everyone else’s Macs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developer beta of macOS 14 Sonoma has been available to download since June 5, 2023. This year the developer beta isn’t just available to developers who have paid to join Apple’s Developer Program (which costs $99/£79), Apple has opened it up to anyone who is a registered developer. We explain how to get a free developer account below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The slightly more stable public beta version is also available for anyone who has signed up for the public beta program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll run through what you need to do to get your hands on the beta of the next version of the Mac operating system, how to install it, and what you should bear in mind if you don’t want to end up in a pickle. If you have not updated to the latest official release of macOS Sonoma here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">how to update macOS on your Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update October 26, 2023</strong>: The macOS Sonoma 14.2 beta is now available.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma beta latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first version of the developer beta of Sonoma arrived after the WWDC keynote on June 5, 2023 as expected. On July 12, Apple released the first public beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the release of macOS Sonoma 14.1 to the public on October 25, 2023, Apple is now working on the development of macOS 14.2. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple released the first beta macOS Sonoma 14.2 to developers on October 26, 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Developer-Beta-of-macOS-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Get developer beta of macOS Sonoma\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Developer-Beta-of-macOS-Sonoma.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 827w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Developer-Beta-of-macOS-Sonoma.jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Developer-Beta-of-macOS-Sonoma.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"827\" height=\"582\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma public beta vs developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has made the Developer Beta available to anyone who had registered as a developer, even if they aren’t a paid-up member of Apple’s Developer Program. As a result, people with a basic free developer account were able to download the macOS Sonoma developer beta after the keynote on June 5 (we show you how to register below).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you should download the developer beta if you aren’t a developer is another question. We don’t recommend you install the developer beta if you aren’t a developer. Instead, our recommendation was to wait for the public beta, which is here now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few differences between the public and developer betas. The public beta is not the same as the beta that is released through the developer program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers get updates to their beta first, and possibly more frequently. But you should keep in mind that betas are by nature not stable, and because the public beta comes after the developer beta it could be a little safer to install. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant difference is probably the motive of the testers: Developers usually have the aim of ensuring their apps work when the updated macOS is released to the general public, while public beta testers are essentially helping Apple detect bugs and offering feedback on the features. Because of this developers may get to test new features not available in the public beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get the public beta the first thing you need to do, if you haven’t already, is join Apple’s beta programs read this for more information:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to become an Apple beta tester.</a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"How Get Public Beta Apple \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Get-Apple-Public-Beta-1-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get a free developer account</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just want a free Apple Developer account so you can access the beta you can get this via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS.

We’ll cover that below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is the macOS beta stable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By its nature, a beta has the potential to be unstable. Therefore it’s not advised that you install it on a Mac that you rely on. If you have a second Mac that isn’t mission-critical then install it there. We strongly recommend that you don’t risk all by putting the macOS beta on your primary macOS, especially not in the early days of the beta development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have a second Mac there are a couple of ways you could run macOS beta on your Mac without running the risk of losing data or finding your Mac stops working:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We recommend installing it on a partition – which these days is really a volume (and is much easier to create than a partition was). Read about how to do that here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672589/how-to-dual-boot-mac-run-macos-together.html\">How to dual-boot Mac: Run two versions of macOS on a Mac</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alternatively, you could <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672585/how-to-install-macos-on-an-external-drive.html\">install the macOS beta on an external drive</a> and run it on that.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">safety of the macOS beta and the risks you might be taking</a> in more detail in a separate article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the stability of the beta worries you then you are probably better off waiting until the final version is out, or at least waiting until testing has been happening for a few months before getting the beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to prepare your Mac for the beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update your software</strong>: We recommend you have the latest full version of macOS installed, although Apple says that the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility requires macOS 10.8 or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make space:</strong> We’d recommend at least 15GB of available space because the macOS betas tend to be very large. If you end up requiring more space read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671020/how-to-clear-disk-space-on-a-mac.html\">How to free up space on Mac</a><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674829/how-to-delete-other-storage-on-a-mac.html\">.</a> Note that we always recommend that you have at least 10% space free on your Mac at any time, so if you don’t have that expect problems!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Back up</strong>: Before you install a beta on your Mac you should make a backup of your data and files. You can find <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670470/how-to-set-up-a-time-capsule.html\">out how to use Time Machine to back up your Mac</a>. We also have a round-up<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668696/protect-your-mac-with-these-mac-backup-software-options.html\"> of suitable backup solutions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to send feedback to Apple</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you come across an error or a bug you should use the Feedback Assistant app to provide feedback to Apple. Launch the app and follow the appropriate steps, selecting the area about which you’re providing feedback and then any specific sub-area. Then describe your issue in a single sentence, before providing a more detailed description, including any specific steps that reproduce the issue. You’ll also be able to attach other files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also have to give permission for the Feedback Assistant app to collect diagnostic information from your Mac.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Beta-Feedback-Assistant.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Beta Feedback Assistant\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Beta-Feedback-Assistant.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 758w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Beta-Feedback-Assistant.jpg?resize=300%2C227&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"758\" height=\"573\" /></figure><p> </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It won’t always be obvious whether something is a bug or just not as easy to use as you might have hoped. Either way, if your feedback is that something appears to work in an illogical way, Apple will want to know that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are having trouble with a third-party app you can let Apple know by reporting it through the 3rd-party Application Compatibility category in the Feedback Assistant. However, we’d suggest that you also provide feedback to the app’s developer who will no doubt be grateful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Will I be able to update from macOS beta to the final version?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta users will be able to install the final build of the OS on release day without needing to reformat or reinstall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I talk about the beta publicly?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Apple and the license agreement all beta testers must agree to, the beta is “Apple confidential information”. By accepting those terms, you agree not to discuss your use of the software with anyone who isn’t also in the Beta Software Program. That means you can’t “blog, post screenshots, tweet, or publicly post information about the public beta software.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can discuss any information that Apple has publicly disclosed; the company says that information is no longer considered confidential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to downgrade from the macOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can always revert to an earlier version of macOS, though depending on how you back up, it’s not necessarily a painless process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by making sure the data on your drive is backed up, then erase the drive and install the latest public version of macOS. When you first startup your Mac you can use the Migration Assistant to import your data from the backup.
