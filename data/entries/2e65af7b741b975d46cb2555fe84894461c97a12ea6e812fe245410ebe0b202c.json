Thanks for your patience, and rest assured, there’s more Nerd Alert to come sooner than later!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week’s episode takes The Nerds to the UCI Road World Championships in Belgium!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caley, Ronan, and Shoddy scoured the team pit areas for all the shiny new bits, and they found what looks to be new hookless-compatible GP5000 tubeless tires from Continental and some interesting new rollers from Wahoo Fitness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worlds is always a weird one for the mechanics given the mix of national and trade teams, and it’s even weirder this time around. We’ve all grown accustomed at this point to not being able to find bikes or parts, but if it makes you feel any better, it turns out that even top pro riders and teams can’t get them, either. A Roubaix win on Shimano 105??? Stranger things have happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/c74257e0-deda-49fc-b2ea-551819ac9483.gif\" />     SUBSCRIBE TO THE ‘NERD ALERT’ PODCAST</strong><br />Never miss an episode.
