Today in New York, Cadillac took the wraps off its next electric vehicle, and it's a large one—a fully electric version of the Escalade. Called the Escalade IQ, Cadillac has gone all-out, fitting this one with a monster battery that stores enough energy to propel this behemoth 450 miles (724 km) before it needs plugging in.</p>\n<p>The Escalade IQ isn't just a big battery and some electric motors shoehorned into the internal combustion version <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/an-augmented-reality-dashboard-stars-in-the-2021-cadillac-escalade/\">that we tested in 2020.</a> It's a clean-sheet design that uses GM's new Ultium battery platform and, in this case, the company's  architecture shared by the forthcoming Chevrolet Silverado EV, among others.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2025-Cadillac-Escalade-IQ-3-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"LEDs replace a physical front grille.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2025-Cadillac-Escalade-IQ-3-980x735.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2025-Cadillac-Escalade-IQ-3-scaled.jpg\">LEDs replace a physical front grille.</a> (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p></div>\n<p>It's an imposing thing, with a high bluff nose, which is so unfortunately on-trend right now, and frankly enormous 24-inch wheels. It's actually even bigger than the gas-powered Escalade, at 224.3 inches (5,697 mm) long, 85.3 inches (2,167 mm) wide, and 76.1 inches (1,934 mm) tall, with a 136.2-inch (3,460 mm) wheelbase.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959843#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959843&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
