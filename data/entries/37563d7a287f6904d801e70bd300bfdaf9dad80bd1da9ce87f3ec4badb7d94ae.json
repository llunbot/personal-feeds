While regulators hold up the next flight of the world's largest rocket, there's a lot of news this week in the small launch sectorâ€”some good, some bad.

The test flight went well for about two and a half minutes before the vehicle experienced a problem just before landing and erupted into a fireball, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/09/a-chinese-rocket-narrowly-missed-a-landing-on-sunday-the-video-is-amazing/\">Ars reports</a>. The company said it learned a lot from the test, completing 10 of its 11 major objectives. It plans to attempt another high-altitude test flight as early as November. Deep Blue Aerospace is one of several Chinese aerospace startups seeking to emulate the success that US-based SpaceX has had with vertical takeoff and vertical landing of rockets.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052950#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052950&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"37563d7a287f6904d801e70bd300bfdaf9dad80bd1da9ce87f3ec4badb7d94ae","category":"Tech"}
