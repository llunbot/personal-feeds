When it comes to single-core performance, the M4 is faster than the M3 Max MacBook Pro, and it's comparable to the ‌M2‌ Max in multi-core performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor context, here are the single-core and multi-core scores of prior chips (all max CPU/GPU variants):\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M4</strong> - 3,695/14,550</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>A17 Pro</strong> - 2,908/7,234</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M2</strong> - 2,540/9,360</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M2 Pro</strong> - 2,651/14,295</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M2 Max</strong> - 2,802/14,800</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M1</strong> - 2,272/8,208</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M3</strong> - 3,087/11,702</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M3 Pro</strong> - 3,112/15,286</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>M3 Max</strong> - 3,128/20,957</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nCompared to the ‌M2‌ in the prior version of the ‌iPad Pro‌, the M4 is 46 percent faster when it comes to single-core performance, and 55 percent faster in multi-core performance. Apple didn't use the M3 in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, but it is up to 24 percent faster than the M3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said that the M4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance than the ‌M2‌ in the prior-generation ‌iPad Pro‌, which is accurate based on the benchmarks we've seen so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to bring the M4 chip family to all of its products across 2024 and 2025, with the first M4 Macs slated for later this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/\">iPad Pro's M4 Chip Outperforms M3 by Up to 25%</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pros-m4-chip-outperforms-m3-by-up-to-25.2425947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a162938d0588a342b3e13f0b244c3a1841285534c50ec8bd1f4f8a9f54bbacf7","category":"Apple"}
