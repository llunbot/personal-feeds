He’s at it again, but this time, he’s on the ground floor of a new eBike company called <a href=\"https://www.morelle.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Morelle</a>. The company was officially launched in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their mission is to round up experts in the lithium-ion battery, mechanical engineering, and mobility worlds. They want to “address the unmet challenges of weight reduction, fast charging, and ease of operation,” hoping to “make electric micromobility an essential form of transport and to make robotics more ubiquitous.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery.webp\" alt=\"SOC: Morelle eBike battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-battery-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / R.

It’s a clean-looking frame and would make a great platform for an all-rounder type eBike. Hidden behind the scenes was an actual bike with a fully working battery system that supposedly delivers the 15-min charge. Because the prototype bike didn’t have the layout of the production bike, they didn’t want us to photograph it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor.webp\" alt=\"SOC: Morelle eBike motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-motor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform utilizes some pretty advanced, fast-charging, silicon-based batteries that were originally developed for aviation applications, along with micromobility fast chargers. Morelle’s first eBike claims to fully charge in 15 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some Info off the Morelle Site</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo.webp\" alt=\"SOC: Morelle eBike seat tube logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-seat-tube-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My eyes started glazing over a bit on the battery tech, so I thought I would give it to you straight from the Morelle website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Machine Learning: </strong><br />“<em>Fast charging is much more valuable when you can fast charge every cycle, for the life of the application. Our technology is very durable, demonstrating the ability to fast charge every cycle for over 1,000 cycles, but we want to make it better. We have developed a proprietary machine learning model that constantly remotely monitors the health of the battery and dynamically provides improvements to battery life based on individual use profiles</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advanced Materials</strong><br /><em>“Morelle’s core technology starts with the battery chemistry, most notably a silicon-based anode (versus graphite in standard batteries). Silicon has 10X the capacity of graphite but often has challenges with durability – our cells are unique in their ability to simultaneously exhibit high power, high energy, and high charge rates, without compromising cycle life. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The ability to truly fast charge the battery is valuable for so many applications as it completely changes the operability and economics of small mobility applications.  Our first eBike will have a 350-watt-hour battery pack with the ability to be charged at 50A”.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs.webp\" alt=\"SOC: Morelle eBike rear drop outs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-rear-drop-outs-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dynamic Charging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Every non-Morelle eBike in the world charges at a rate of 100-300W — this is what we call ‘Level M1’ (‘M’ for micromobility). Morelle utilizes Level M2 (1000- 1200W) and Level M3 (over 1500W) chargers, setting the bar for eBike fast charging.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It has embedded hardware and software in the charger to run diagnostics on the battery to optimize cycle life by adjusting charge protocols, in real time.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Morelle believes we can incorporate small compact chargers in optimized locations based upon users habits. More importantly, we plan to augment existing (EV) level 2 chargers (mechanically and with software) for micromobility charging.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>$50 Reserves Yours Now!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube.webp\" alt=\"SOC: Morelle eBike headtube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOC-Morelle-eBike-headtube-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $3000 (starting price)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveries will begin in Q1 of 2026, with the first model “in limited quantity”.
