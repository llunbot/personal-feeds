Apple has already used titanium in some Apple Watch models,\nfor the physical Apple Card, and at times for the PowerBook.</p>\n\n<p>Titanium’s toughness, though, is only achieved when it used as\npart of a titanium alloy with other metals. Titanium is also prone\nto smudges from fingerprints, and its finish can be unattractive.\nApple is therefore certain to be using an alloy, and it presumably\naddresses these issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope this is true. Stainless steel is just too heavy; titanium would be a much nicer premium upgrade over aluminum. The titanium Apple Watch models are great, especially the Space Black model with a highly-scratch-resistant DLC finish.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/27/titanium-iphones\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3b6589092bdc9086d73b12a95324c27624be4d22b4f2da6f79085330ad312b0b","category":"Tech"}
