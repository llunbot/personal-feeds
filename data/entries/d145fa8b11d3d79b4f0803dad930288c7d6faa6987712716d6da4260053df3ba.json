I was a complete novice to bikepacking, with absolutely no idea what I was doing. Once I completed cycling the length of a country, I tried to traverse an entire continent, and before long, a dream of cycling 18,000-miles of ‘the world’ was in sight. Three years after my amateur beginnings in Vietnam, I had made it through Europe, Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and South America on two wheels.</p>\n<p>While I have a background in filmmaking, this trip was meant to be a personal quest, so I left my camera at home and deliberately avoided excess technology. Much to the dismay of Strava account requestees, I never once pre-planned my route. I let instinct run wild, starting at a given point on the atlas with only a rough idea of an end destination and no preconceived expectations for my route to get there. In this sense, I was able to let the experience unfold and, paraphrasing the wise words of Steinbeck, let the trip take me where it wished. Alongside my map-making—in albeit analogue proportions—I intentionally stepped away from the video camera, opting for a first hand experience over one behind a viewfinder. Somewhere along the way in Africa I was at a loss for words to describe what was happening to my inner and outer world, so I reached for my camera once again, breaking all rules I had set for myself, yet somehow feeling like this time I was filming the adventure for all the right reasons. Sometimes the most important stories are those you never meant to tell.</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way in Africa I was at a loss for words to describe what was happening to my inner and outer world, so I reached for my camera once again, breaking all rules I had set for myself, yet somehow feeling like this time I was filming the adventure for all the right reasons.

I felt a deep responsibility to continue a ripple effect of many bold explorers before me. If it weren’t for the stories shared by Robyn Davidson, Liz Clark, Kate Harris and Alastair Humphreys (just to name a few), I would have never felt empowered enough to begin on such an ambitious goal.</p>\n<p>Almost at once, I began editing my documentary film. Thousands of hours of content wasn’t my only puzzle to solve. I was bursting at the seams with stories, lessons and findings, blossoming from years of experiences on a human-powered vessel, and eager to decode their mystery and share them with the world.</p>\n<p>Weaving my message with moving images was a task that became as adventurous as my world-wide quest. Many have asked at Film Tour Q&amp;A sessions the two dreaded words. “What’s next?” To me, the unknown of creating a documentary film, live audience presentations, and writing a book are a kaleidoscope of unknown. A next adventure of its own boundless, bravery-demanding proportions.</p>\n<p>My 35-minute documentary film, <em><a href=\"http://cyclingtheworldfilm.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling The World</a></em> is coming soon to the world, with a public release slated for February 1, 2024.</p>\n<p>Until then, the only way to view the documentary is at Film Tour event. I hope to see you all at the Patagonia store in Palo Alto, California on January 24!”  — McKenzie Barney</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Route.png?fit=1200,924&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Route.png?w=1640&amp;quality=75 1640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Route.png?resize=1200,676&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Route.png?resize=768,433&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/Route.png?resize=1536,865&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Read more about her journey in McKenzie’s two-part story: Cycling The World <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/cycling-the-world-with-mckenzie-barney-part-one/\" target=\"_blank\">Part I</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mckenzie-barney-cycling-the-world-part-two/\" target=\"_blank\">Part II</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/announcing-cycling-the-world-film-event-patagonia-palo-alto/\">Announcing Cycling the World Film Event hosted by Patagonia Palo Alto on January 24</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d145fa8b11d3d79b4f0803dad930288c7d6faa6987712716d6da4260053df3ba","category":"Cycling"}
