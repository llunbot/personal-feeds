{"title":"Meta Used Its Onavo VPN to Snoop on Users’ Encrypted Snapchat Traffic","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/facebook-secret-project-snooped-snapchat-user-traffic/","date":1711741790000,"content":"\n<p>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Whenever someone asks a question about Snapchat, the answer is \nusually that because their traffic is encrypted we have no \nanalytics about them,” Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote \nin an email dated June 9, 2016, which was published as part of the \nlawsuit. “Given how quickly they’re growing, it seems important to \nfigure out a new way to get reliable analytics about them. Perhaps \nwe need to do panels or write custom software. You should figure \nout how to do this.” </p>\n\n<p>Facebook’s engineers solution was to use Onavo, a VPN-like service \nthat Facebook acquired in 2013. In 2019, Facebook shut down Onavo \nafter a TechCrunch investigation revealed that Facebook had been \nsecretly paying teenagers to use Onavo so the company could access \nall of their web activity. </p>\n\n<p>After Zuckerberg’s email, the Onavo team took on the project and a \nmonth later proposed a solution: so-called kits that can be \ninstalled on iOS and Android that intercept traffic for specific \nsubdomains, “allowing us to read what would otherwise be encrypted \ntraffic so we can measure in-app usage,” read an email from July \n2016. “This is a ‘man-in-the-middle’ approach.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Later, according to the court documents, Facebook expanded the \nprogram to Amazon and YouTube. Inside Facebook, there wasn’t a \nconsensus on whether Project Ghostbusters was a good idea. Some \nemployees, including Jay Parikh, Facebook’s then-head of \ninfrastructure engineering, and Pedro Canahuati, the then-head of \nsecurity engineering, expressed their concern. “I can’t think of a \ngood argument for why this is okay. No security person is ever \ncomfortable with this, no matter what consent we get from the \ngeneral public. The general public just doesn’t know how this \nstuff works,” Canahuati wrote in an email, included in the court \ndocuments. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s the Facebook we know and love.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018 <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/22/facebook-onavo-app-store\">Apple removed Onavo from the App Store</a>, but the fact that Facebook was using Onavo in this way <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/10/facebook-copycatting\">was known a year earlier</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/meta-onavo-snapchat\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0505f6b0205df16c005b5c14dbe736ac66d296005c8f38587c728582254b9e02","category":"Tech"}
