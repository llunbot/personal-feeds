Replacing a hot and noisy gasoline or diesel powertrain with batteries and electric motors makes life better for the drivers (and riders, in the case of a bus), with less noise and vibration—benefits that extend to everyone else in the area, too.</p>\n<p>Even better is that school districts around the country are in the process of electrifying their bus fleets. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/maryland-school-district-places-largest-ever-order-for-electric-buses/\">Montgomery County, Maryland,</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/12/virginia-has-big-plans-for-electric-school-buses-in-2020/\">the Commonwealth of Virginia</a> have both announced ambitious plans that also involve using the buses as vehicle-to-grid energy storage when they're not in use.</p>\n<p>The District of Columbia, which is sandwiched between Montgomery County and Northern Virginia, is also finalizing its electrification roadmap.
