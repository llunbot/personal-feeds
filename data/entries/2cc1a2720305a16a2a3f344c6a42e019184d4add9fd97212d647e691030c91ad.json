Devinci Cycles decided to create a unique build spec of the recently updated Troy, which features SRAM’s new Eagle 90 mechanical transmission and some high-performance components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to a custom build spec, the Troy Eagle 90 LTD gets a unique color for its fifth-generation Troy frame. With its mechanical drivetrain the LTD model sells for less than the Troy GX AXS 12s announced last fall, despite having an upgraded suspension package and other choice bits and pieces.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Troy Eagle 90 LTD – Frame Details:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy Eagle 90 LTD, linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-linkage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Troy Eagle 90 LTD boasts a special build spec, but the frame is no different than the other fifth-generation Troys. For your convenience, let’s quickly run down some of the key features and fitments of the current Troy frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made in Canada, the Troy’s frame is constructed from Optimum G04 6061 T6 aluminum. Devinci’s Split Pivot suspension linkage provides 150 mm of rear travel. The Eagle 90 LTD build comes with a 160mm fork.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Troy frames are MX or 29” wheel compatible, but like the other Troys, the LTD model is only sold as an MX bike. A flip-chip in the lower shock mount maintains a fixed geometry with an MX wheelset in its High position but also allows for High and Low geometry settings with matched 29” wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, Shed frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-II-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Please note this photo shows the Troy GX AXS 12s, in that model’s Gloss/Matcha frame color.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Troy frames also get Devinci’s “Shed” in-frame storage compartment in the down tube, to conveniently carry your ride essentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key fitments include a Boost 148mm rear axle, 73mm threaded BB shell, and UDH-compatible dropouts. The frame provides ample clearance for 29×2.5” or 27.5×2.6” tires and accepts 31.6mm seatposts. Last but not least, the new Troys got full internal cable routing through the front and rear ends, with slick straight-entry ports at the head tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the chart below for all of the Troy’s possible geometry settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-5thgen-geometry-chart.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-5thgen-geometry-chart.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-5thgen-geometry-chart.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-5thgen-geometry-chart-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-5thgen-geometry-chart-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Troy-5thgen-geometry-chart-768x533.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Troy Eagle 90 LTD Build Spec:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-rear-shock.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-rear-shock.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy Eagle 90 LTD, rear shock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-rear-shock.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-rear-shock-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-rear-shock-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-rear-shock-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the unique build on the Eagle 90 LTD model, the LTD title means…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“At Devinci, a bike with the LTD designation represents the staff’s favorite. Key components such as tires, brakes, handlebar, fork, and hubs are meticulously chosen and upgraded to enhance the bike’s performance a little bit beyond its original intention.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Troy Eagle 90 LTD starts with a RockShox suspension package, with a ZEB Select+ 160mm fork (beefed up from the Troy GX AXS 12s’ Lyrik) and a Vivid Select+ rear shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy Eagle 90 LTD, drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Devinci-Cycles-Troy-Eagle-90-LTD-drivetrain-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the bike’s name advertises the main feature of the build: The new SRAM Eagle 90 mechanical transmission.
