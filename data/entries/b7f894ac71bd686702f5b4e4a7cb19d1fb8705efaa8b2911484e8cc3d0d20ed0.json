We’ve heard <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234037/apple-airtags-bluetooth-track-find-my-ultrawide-band-u1-keychain-locate-lost-items.html\">rumors about AirTag</a> since around 2019, and the company finally released its own tracker in April 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AirTag is pretty simple, really: You add your AirTag to your account, attach it to some object, and then the Find My app will tell you where it is in the Items tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since nearly all modern Apple products can passively (and privately) use their Bluetooth radios to locate lost devices, you’ll have a pretty good chance of locating something that you accidentally leave somewhere. You can locate devices in real-time, and also set a device to “Lost Mode,” which will notify you and display an optional phone number and message on the screen of whatever Apple got near enough to “find” it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to know about Apple’s own tracking devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirTag release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in May 2024 that Apple will be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2338605/airtag-update-2025-location-tracking-new-chip.html\">upgrading the AirTag in the middle of 2025</a>.

If you want an item tracker, what you care about are things like size, durability, the scale of the network, and price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s first-party trackers cost $29/£29 each. That’s even less than the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/store/tiles/pro&amp;xcust=1-1-343664-1-343670-15156&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$35 Tile Pro</a> and about on par with Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag+. Apple lets you buy a four-pack for $99. AirTag went on sale on Friday, April 23, 2021, and they started shipping on April 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to track an AirTag</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You use the Find My app to track your AirTag. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need a new app to use AirTag. They’ll show up as Items in the Find My app, newly updated for anyone with iOS 14.3, iPadOS 14.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.1 or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirTag requirements</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AirTag require an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Find My works on a Mac, and MacBooks are a part of the Find My network, you’ll need an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS 14.5 or later, or iPad running iPadOS 14.5 or later in order to set up your AirTag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once set up, AirTag work with all modern Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, iPod Touch devices, and MacBooks. You’ll be able to use Find My on all these devices to locate the objects you’ve attached an AirTag to. What’s more, all these devices are used to create the Find My network—hundreds of millions of Apple devices that all register the locations of your items whenever they pass within Bluetooth range.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The U1 chip allows for Precision Finding</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need an iPhone with the U1 chip (the iPhone 11 or iPhone 12) in order to use AirTags. But if you have one, you can use a feature called Precision Finding. It uses the accelerometer, cameras, and more to direct you to the exact location of your tag. An arrow appears on the screen to show the direction and distance.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2612w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>On iPhones with a U1 chip, you can get precise and direct directions to your AirTag.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2612w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>On iPhones with a U1 chip, you can get precise and direct directions to your AirTag.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2612w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/precision-finding-airtags.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>On iPhones with a U1 chip, you can get precise and direct directions to your AirTag.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirTag and privacy concerns</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are concerns about whether someone can use an AirTag to track you. Apple has measures in place to prevent this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is true with all devices on the Find My network—from iPhones to e-bikes—there is no personally-identifiable information shared with anyone at any time. Apple uses end-to-end encryption and unique random identifiers, so it never knows which devices belong to which people. Only your devices know which identifiers are yours. What’s more, Apple only sends location information when it’s requested and only retains it for 24 hours. Unless you have Lost Mode enabled, other users never know which devices they have come across. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However there have been cases of AirTags being used to stalk people. Not long after the AirTag release in April 2021, several <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/630375/police-report-150-airtags-cases-and-thats-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html\">reports</a> appeared in the media about the AirTag being used to track people unwillingly and unknowingly. In one report, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vj3y/apple-airtags-police-reports-stalking-harassment&amp;xcust=1-1-343664-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">150 cases</a> that involved stalking with an AirTag were recorded by eight U.S. police departments. How many total reported cases in the U.S. of all police departments is not known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/02/an-update-on-airtag-and-unwanted-tracking/&amp;xcust=1-1-343664-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">statement</a> in February 2021 that addressed unwanted AirTag tracking. “AirTag was designed to help people locate their personal belongings, not to track people or another person’s property,” said Apple, “and we condemn in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products.” The statement also said that the company works with law enforcement and the company announced new features (listed below) in response to the concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an unknown AirTag is detected nearby you will receive a warning.

One consideration in that example is that the child’s teacher may receive a concerning tracking alert.
