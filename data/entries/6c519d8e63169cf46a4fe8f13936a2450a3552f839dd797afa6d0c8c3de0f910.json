It was renamed to ‘Ronin’ following a model update from the previous ATB and has continually evolved with each update to remain a practical tool, with subtle new features in refinement. These new features include our original rear dropouts and a reshaping of the seat stays.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4371.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4371.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4371.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4371.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The name Ronin (浪人) signifies “wandering the world without being bound by anything.” This ethos is reflected in its design, emphasizing versatility within the many standards and conventions of an ever evolving bicycle landscape. It accommodates a wide range of preferred configurations and tire sizes, offering greater flexibility. The bike that you select for 90% of the riding you do—this is the essence of Ronin as a tool.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4495.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4495.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4495.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/DSCF4495.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re searching for a versatile bike for everyday use, extended day rides on mixed surfaces, or multi-day tours, Ronin has you covered.
