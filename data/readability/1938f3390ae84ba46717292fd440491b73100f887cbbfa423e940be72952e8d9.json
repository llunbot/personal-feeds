Now entering its third generation, the Wildcat V3 increases its rear wheel travel from 120mm to 125mm with the introduction of metric shock sizing, still benefiting from sliding dropouts that are said to make it mullet compatible. Word is, there’s a long travel Wildcat in the works, but for now, let’s take a closer look at this short travel aluminium trail bike.</p><h2>RSD Wildcat V3</h2><div id=\"attachment_279216\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-279216\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green.jpg\" alt=\"rsd wildcat v3 125mm travel trail bike\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24090451/rsd-wildcat-v3-green-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-279216\">The Wildcat V3 is composed of a 7005 double-butted and heat-treated aluminum tubeset, while the headtube, dropouts, rocker, BB Shell and yoke are CNC machined</p></div><p>For 2022, the RSD Wildcat V3 sees a front triangle refresh, featuring significantly shorter and straighter seat tubes across the S-XL size range for the fitment of longer travel dropper seat posts.

There is no flip-chip to be seen, thus nothing to compensate for the geometry changes that will occur with the switch to a 27.5″ rear wheel; namely, a lower bottom bracket height, slacker seat and head tube angles, as well as a slight reduction in reach. Switching out the stock 140mm fork for a 130mm travel option would correct for some, but not all of these changes.
