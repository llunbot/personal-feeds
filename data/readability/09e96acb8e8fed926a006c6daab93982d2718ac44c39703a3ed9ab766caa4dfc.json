The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez.</p><p>For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same.</p><p>But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-Alaska-Pipeline-FKT-%E2%80%94-Rugile-Kaladyte-%E2%80%94-Small-%E2%80%94-04-1-650x433.jpg\"><figcaption>Lael Wilcox riding the Alaska Pipeline Photo Credit: Rugile Kaladyte</figcaption></figure><div><h2>WHAT IS ‘FROM THE SOURCE’?</h2><p>When you see an article containing ‘From the source’ label on the homepage or with the headline in blue, note that this is content directly from the brand and it has been vetted by our Editors and deemed worthy of your attention.
