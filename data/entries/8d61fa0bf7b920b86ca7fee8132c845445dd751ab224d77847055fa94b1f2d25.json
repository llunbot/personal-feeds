LOOK offsets the pin heights slightly. Now, outer pins sit 2mm taller than the inner ones, creating a mechanical grip that anchors the foot securely without feeling locked down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders can fine-tune the pin height to match their footwear and trail conditions. Dialing in the perfect balance of hold and float.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side-.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1336\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side-.webp\" alt=\"Look ROC Trail Pedal trails side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side-.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side--1536x1026.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side--768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-trails-side--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lightweight, Durable, and Built to Last</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At <span><strong>224g per pedal</strong> (448g for</span> the set), the new Trail Roc pedals strike a balance between robust construction and competitive weight for the category. For maximum strength, LOOK utilizes a 46000-series aluminum body paired with a chromoly spindle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1336\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur.webp\" alt=\"Look ROC Trail Pedal speed blur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur-1536x1026.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-speed-blur-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, the pedal spins on dual-sealed cartridge bearings paired with an aluminum bushing. This is designed to shrug off trail grit and moisture for seasons of low-maintenance riding. The oversized axle enhances load-bearing capability, particularly during high-impact loads. Each axle assembly is pre-greased and fully serviceable. Pin durability also gets a boost. The newly designed pins are recessed into the pedal body to help avoid shearing off on rock strikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider-.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1336\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider-.webp\" alt=\"Look ROC Trail Pedal rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider-.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider--1536x1026.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider--768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-rider--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>LOOK Cycle Category Manager Alexandre Lavaud summed it up:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Our made-in-France Trail Roc pedal is back and better than ever. We listened to rider feedback and gave it a tougher aluminum body, a wider platform, and eight carefully placed pins for a serious grip. Plus, we made sure it’s super robust and reliable — so riders can focus on the trail, not on maintenance.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-black.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-black.webp\" alt=\"Look ROC Trail Pedal black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-black.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-black-297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-black-1536x1229.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-black-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-black-768x614.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trail Roc Flat Pedal — Key Specs:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Body:</strong> Concave 46000-series aluminum</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Footprint:</strong> 105 x 106mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pins:</strong> 8 adjustable 12mm pins per side</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Axle:</strong> Chromoly+</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bearings:</strong> Dual-sealed cartridge with aluminum bushing and premium sealing</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Q-Factor:</strong> 56mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Profile:</strong> 17mm thick</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 448g (pair)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MSRP: </strong>$99 / €99,90 / £89.99</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill.webp\" alt=\"Look ROC Trail Pedal all windmill\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Look-ROC-Trail-Pedal-all-windmill-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail Roc pedals are available now in three colorways: <strong>Classic Black</strong>, <strong>Hope Green</strong>, and <strong>Bold Purple</strong>, through LOOK Cycle dealers and at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lookcycle.com/\">lookcycle.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/look-roc-trail-pedal/\">LOOK Updates Trail ROC Flat Pedals With New Body &amp; Pin Layout</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8d61fa0bf7b920b86ca7fee8132c845445dd751ab224d77847055fa94b1f2d25","category":"Cycling"}
