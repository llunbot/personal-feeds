Will Apple hold a Black Friday sale? <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1382296/different-think-apple-black-friday-sale.html\">We wish it would</a> but, unfortunately, Apple’s Black Friday deal is usually a giveaway of gift cards with certain purchases made during the Black Friday period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an idea of what to expect, more details on previous Apple Black Friday events can be found below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2023: The best Apple deals in the U.S.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you would be paying full price at the Apple Store, albeit with a voucher incentive in some cases, here are the best Apple deals we found at other retailers back in November 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5KWB9H\">13-inch MacBook Air, M1 (256GB):</a> $749 ($250 off, MSRP $999)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7686169/ref=fs_a_mbt2_us1\" target=\"_blank\">15-inch MacBook Air, M2 (10-core GPU, 256GB)</a>: $1,049 ($250 off, MSRP $1,299)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5LN355\" target=\"_blank\">14-inch, M3 Pro, 11-core CPU, 14-core GPU, 512GB SSD</a>: $1,799 ($200 off, MSRP: $1,999)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0BSHGHGXR/\">Mac mini (M2, 256GB)</a>: $499 ($100 off, MSRP $599)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHWRXH8B/\">AirPods Pro (2nd-gen, USB-C case)</a>: $190 ($59 off, MSRP $249)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods (2nd gen)</a>: $80 ($49 off, MSRP $129)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B0CHX2ZLR7/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm, GPS)</a>: $329 ($70 off, MSRP $399) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX7R6WJ/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch SE (2nd gen, 40mm)</a>: $179 ($70 off, MSRP $249)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9CJM1Z\" target=\"_blank\">iPad (9th-gen, 64GB)</a>: $230 ($99 off, MSRP $329)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLXMVMV\" target=\"_blank\">iPad (10th-gen, 64GB)</a>: $349 ($100 off, MSRP $449)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2023: The best Apple deals in the U.K.</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>KRCS, <a href=\"https://www.krcs.co.uk/macbook-pro-14-inch-m3-8-core-cpu-10-core-gpu-8gb-512gb-space-grey\" target=\"_blank\">14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (8-core CPU, 10-core GPU), 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD</a>: £1,529.10 (£169.90 off, MSRP £1,699) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>KRCS, <a href=\"https://www.krcs.co.uk/macbook-pro-16-inch-m3-pro-12-core-cpu-18-core-gpu-18gb-512gb-space-black\" target=\"_blank\">16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro (12-core CPU, 18-core GPU), 18GB RAM, 512GB SSD</a>: £2,339.10 (£259.90 off, MSRP £2,599)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C764GYX6\" target=\"_blank\">15-inch MacBook Air, M2 (512GB)</a> £1,399 (£200 off, MSRP £1,599)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>KRCS: <a href=\"https://www.krcs.co.uk/mac-mini-m2-pro-10-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-16gb-512gb\" target=\"_blank\">M2 Pro Mac mini, 512GB</a>: £1,259 (£140 off MRSP £1,399)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation/dp/B0BDJ37NF5\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro (2nd gen), USB-C</a>: £199 (£30 off, MSRP £229).

While the qualifying products and voucher amounts change every year, this is Apple’s only deal. Apple doesn’t discount its own products for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Details of Apple’s Black Friday Shopping Event will be found on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s website</a> when available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What was Apple’s Black Friday deal in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$25/£20 Apple Gift Card:</strong> iPhone SE, AirPods (2nd-gen), AirPods (3rd-gen), Beats Flex, Apple Pencil (2nd-gen), Smart Keyboard Folio, Apple TV</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$50/£40 Apple Gift Card</strong>: Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 9, HomePod, Beats Studio Pro, Beats Solo3 Wireless, Powerbeats Pro, Beats Fit Pro, Beats Studio Buds +, Beats Studio Buds, Magic Keyboard, Magic Keyboard Folio,  iPhone 13, AirPods Pro (2nd-gen)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$75/£60 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPhone 14, AirPods Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$100/£80 Apple Gift Card</strong>: iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad 10th gen, iPad Pro, Mac mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$150/£120 Apple Gift Card</strong>: 13-inch MacBook Air (M1)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$175/£140 Apple Gift Card</strong>: 13-inch MacBook Air (M2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$200/£160 Apple Gift Card</strong>: 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac mini</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the iPhone 15, M3 iMac, and M3-series MacBook Pro were all recent introductions Apple wasn’t offering any vouchers with those purchases. But the company was offering gift cards with Apple Watch 9 purchases for the first time.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Black Friday 2023 Apple\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Friday-Apple-Offer.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How good was Apple’s 2023 Black Friday deal?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 deal didn’t look as good as that of 2022 when Apple offered up to $250/£250 in Apple Gift Cards with the MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch. In 2023 the biggest voucher was $200/£200 for the 15-inch MacBook Air – not with the MacBook Pro or iMac.

Although that depends on your perspective – you could also think that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1383475/apples-black-friday-shopping-event-is-somehow-worse-this-year.html\">Apple’s Black Friday shopping event was worse in 2022</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 the biggest Apple Gift Card on offer was for $200/£160, which was the saving offered with the sale of the 27-inch iMac (which was discontinued in 2022). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the discounts on offer were generally a bit better than 2021, Apple didn’t match the offers from other resellers such as Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2024: Best deals for Apple products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/best-apple-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Apple deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/best-macbook-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 MacBook deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373696/best-mac-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Mac Deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1377158/best-airpods-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 AirPods deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1376743/best-apple-watch-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Apple Watch deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/best-ipad-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 iPad deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-iphone-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 iPhone deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375200/best-mac-monitor-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Mac monitor deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373771/best-mac-ssd-hdd-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 SSD and external hard drive deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677125/best-prime-day-apple-accessory-deals-october-2024.html\">Best Black Friday 2024 Apple accessory deals</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2024: When do the sales begin?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Friday officially begins at 12.01am on the day after Thanksgiving, which in 2024 will be Friday, November 29. However, many sales begin well before that, in 2023 we saw deals starting at the beginning of November. The main event runs through the weekend and concludes on Cyber Monday – which is December 2 in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday 2024: Where to get the best deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotting a good Black Friday deal takes a bit of work but we’ll be doing most of it for you. Throughout Black Friday weekend, we’ll be posting deal roundups and calling out specific sales that are worth checking out. Stay tuned to Macworld as we call out the best—and worst—deals all throughout the weekend. These are the retailers that are most likely to have the best prices:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.costco.com\">Costco</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.target.com\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ao.com\" target=\"_blank\">AO.com</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Argos</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.carphonewarehouse.com\" target=\"_blank\">Carphone Warehouse</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Currys</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com\" target=\"_blank\">eBuyer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com\" target=\"_blank\">John Lewis</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.krcs.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">KRCS</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Laptops Direct</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.very.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Very</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday: Should I wait for Cyber Monday to purchase?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s always possible that a better deal is waiting around the corner, if you see a good deal, don’t wait. While Cyber Monday promises impressive deals, prices are usually lowest on Black Friday. Plus there’s always the risk that the Apple device you want sells out and you miss out on the great deal everyone else got.</p>\n\n\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"aed1b14dd11c5cb95c63b9e19a165c07371eec61e860c0c39fcdcee1975486cc","category":"Apple"}
