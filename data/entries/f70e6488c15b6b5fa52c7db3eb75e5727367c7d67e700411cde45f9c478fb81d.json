It made sense after all—at the time, flat-screen TVs were attainable luxury items that fit well into Apple’s media-focused products, including the relatively new Apple TV streaming box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, those rumors never came to pass and as the years went by without a release, we assumed the project was dead. But a new report claims that might not be the case, According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-17/how-will-president-donald-trump-s-new-tariffs-affect-apple-products-and-prices-m3lnfx64\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Gurman’s latest Power On newsletter</a>, the project still has a glimmer of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman doesn’t say much, but in a section talking about a rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2518726/apples-next-big-thing-may-be-a-smart-ipad-you-can-hang-on-your-wall.html\">wall-mounted smart home control center</a>, he mentions that Apple is “evaluating” the possibility of a TV set as part of a new smart-home push. However, Gurman says the project depends on the wall tablet’s success, which will reportedly arrive next year. That device is Apple’s first real entry into the smart home and will reportedly “control appliances, handle videoconferencing and use AI to navigate apps.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than running tvOS, Gurman implies that the TV set will be more like a larger version of the smart home tablet, with a camera for the ability to use FaceTime as well as other non-tvOS apps, including Safari, Notes, and Calendar. Additionally, it would show home security footage as well as control music, which the current Apple TV can do. It would presumably also have a a 4K panel, built-in spatial audio speakers, and the ability to either hang on a wall or sit on a stand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it sounds like such a device is still many years away and very much not a priority for Apple CEO Tim Cook. However, if Apple were to design a TV set, we’re pretty sure there are several Jony Ive prototypes floating around Cupertino.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f70e6488c15b6b5fa52c7db3eb75e5727367c7d67e700411cde45f9c478fb81d","category":"Apple"}
