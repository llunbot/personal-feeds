It’s an outright disgrace. Theft, pure and simple. (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24195083/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-7-hands-on-features-price\">Victoria Song at The Verge calls it</a> “not exactly hiding where it got its inspiration from” and “That’s not necessarily a bad thing!”; I doubt she’d consider it “inspiration” and “not necessarily a bad thing” if someone were to rip off her articles to the degree Samsung rips off Apple’s designs. There is no reason to defend this. Call it what it is: theft.)</p>\n\n<p>I disagree that Samsung was ever “a leader in design”. I don’t recall a time when their strategy was anything other than just outright stealing the designs of whoever the current market leader is and undercutting them on price just enough to take the Pepsi position (happy to be in second place, happy to have no shame). Before they started ripping off the iPhone, they ripped off BlackBerry, and called their rip-off lineup of phones “BlackJack”. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_BlackJack\">Really</a>. These new blatant, shameful rip-offs aren’t an aberration; they define the company that Samsung is.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-ripoff\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7172826c501b790cc005cc07b10424ed477d37812992f3fcb4f75fd090d91b4a","category":"Tech"}
