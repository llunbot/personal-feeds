Once synced, the healthcare provider will be able to see, expand, and interact with the Apple Health app data, allowing them to observe trends and highlight data on-screen for the patient.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/healthkit/\">HealthKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">health</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/bluejeans-telehealth-apple-health-app-support/\">BlueJeans Telehealth Adds Support for Syncing Apple Health App Data</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluejeans-telehealth-adds-support-for-syncing-apple-health-app-data.2307225/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Bj5uT2ShCTs:1T8y-lyKZhM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Bj5uT2ShCTs:1T8y-lyKZhM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Bj5uT2ShCTs\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8d4a1241506ad8a5812e2c699f32f5e8b16eb9a7c2f70236f201166bbc3e7972","category":"Apple"}
