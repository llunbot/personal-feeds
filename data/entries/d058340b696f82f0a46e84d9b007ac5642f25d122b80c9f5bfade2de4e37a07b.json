The S9 chip also has a four-core neural engine for 2x faster neural tasks, according to Apple. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's a new second-generation Ultra Wideband chip in the Ultra that makes it easier to use the Apple Watch Ultra to find your iPhone, and it also supports Precision Finding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 also has a new gesture that uses just the watch hand for when your hands are full. Double tap allows you to tap your index finger and thumb together to do things like answer a call, end a call, snooze an alarm, play or pause music, and more. Double Tap will be available next month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also a new Modular Ultra watch face, and Night mode now turns on automatically in the dark thanks to the ambient light sensor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799.
