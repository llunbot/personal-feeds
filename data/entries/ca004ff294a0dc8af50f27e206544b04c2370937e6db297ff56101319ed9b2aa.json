Starting back in 1999, Cranksgiving turned the classic messenger alleycat format into a fundraising event to help feed those in need. Six years later, Jenny decided to start the West Coast version and, in typical Jenny fashion, tongue in cheek named it for the campy 70’s game show “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket_Sweep\" target=\"_blank\">Supermarket Sweep</a>.” It later became widely known as simply, “The Sweep”.</p>\n<p>At its height The Sweep saw 166 racers and brought in a staggering 18,202lbs of food and $21,229 for the <a href=\"https://www.sfmfoodbank.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SF Marin Food Bank</a>. In operation since 1987, the SF Marin Food Bank currently provides groceries to over 53,000 households and serves 1,000,000+ meals per week through its pop-up pantries and partner organizations. The demand for their services nearly doubled during the pandemic.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-50.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-48.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/the-sweep-49.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“Prior to the pandemic, we were serving about 32,000 households. Now we’re serving 55,000 households. Most of that increase are people that never needed food assistance before and probably never thought they would ever need food assistance. That’s really been the biggest growth of our service demographic. And for us, it’s not going to change. Even though the world is opening back up, that effect isn’t going to be felt by our participants for a really long time. </em></p>\n<p><em>We know that in times of disaster, and we’ve seen this in other food banks, you basically double your service, and then that’s essentially your new normal.</em></p>\n<p><em>I think for me, what I love most about this event is anytime you can find something you’re passionate about and find a way to connect that to philanthropy, that’s what makes my heart sing.

A planned return in late 2022, however, was delayed again due to a month-long rain deluge with 40+mph winds. So, on February 4, 2023 at 11:00am a small but hardy group of 49 racers gathered in the rain at The Arrow on the Embarcadero in San Francisco for the 15th running of The Sweep. Split in three classes (Speed/Points, Cargo, Team) riders had until 4:00pm to finish all of their grocery runs.</p>\n<p>And make runs they did. One Cargo competitor, Josiah Haut, made four trips with a haul for a total 876lbs of rice. “I did 200lbs each run until this last one. Then I thought, ‘hey, maybe I could throw on two more bags.
