But data from subsequent observations showed that the burst originated with the collision of stars (or their remnants) in a densely packed area near the supermassive black hole of an ancient galaxy, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01998-8\">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature Astronomy. Such a rare event has been hypothesized, but this is the first observational evidence for one.</p>\n<p>As we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/its-the-boat-astronomers-observe-brightest-of-all-time-gamma-ray-burst/\">reported previously</a>, gamma-ray bursts are extremely high-energy explosions in distant galaxies lasting between mere milliseconds to several hours. There are two classes of gamma-ray bursts. Most (70 percent) are long bursts lasting more than two seconds, often with a bright afterglow. These are usually linked to galaxies with rapid star formation. Astronomers think that long bursts are tied to the deaths of massive stars collapsing to form a neutron star or black hole (or, alternatively, a newly formed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/behold-the-magnetar-natures-ultimate-superweapon/\">magnetar</a>). The baby black hole would produce jets of highly energetic particles moving near the speed of light, powerful enough to pierce through the remains of the progenitor star, emitting X-rays and gamma rays.</p>\n<p>Those gamma-ray bursts lasting less than two seconds (about 30 percent) are deemed short bursts, usually emitting from regions with very little star formation. Astronomers think these gamma-ray bursts result from mergers between two neutron stars or a neutron star merging with a black hole, comprising a \"kilonova.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949504#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949504&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b38dd87bdf8ad2878df28411dbf67ee3d97485f715bd25e9161651401262a4f","category":"Tech"}
