surprise when they debuted a line of flat and clipless mountain bike shoes a few years ago. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-mallet-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Crankbrothers Mallet Boa</a> is the range-topping clipless model that was designed to meet the needs of enduro and downhill racers and riders. While it may be aimed at more gravity-fueled riding disciplines, this versatile shoe is also great for trail riding with a reasonable weight, good pedaling efficiency, and supernatural comfort. The Mallet shoes also come in <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-mallet-speedlace-mountain-bike-shoe-mens%3Fskid%3DCRNH015-REBLWHREOU-S100\">Speedlace</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-mallet-lace-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Lace versions</a> that will save you $30 and $50, respectively. </p><p></p><p>Given their extensive line of pedals, it makes sense that Crankbrothers designed their shoes to work in combination with them, and they even include a set of Crankbrothers cleats pre-installed on all Mallet shoes. This is awesome if you ride Crankbrothers’ pedals as you get a fresh set of cleats, and all you need to do is position them in your preferred location to be ready to roll. If you ride any other brand of pedals, fear not, the Mallets also work great with any mountain bike pedals that use 2-bolt cleats. The <em>Match Box</em> cleat box is generously sized and allows for ample side-to-side and fore-aft adjustability including the “Race Zone” for those who like to slam their cleats way back for stability on the descents. The <em>Match Box</em> is also ramped at the front and rear which helps enhance the ease of clipping in and out of your pedals and the soles on either side of the cleats interface well with most pedal platforms for added stability. </p><p></p><p>Getting in and out of the Mallet Boa is quick and easy with a single Boa Li2 dial and a velcro strap at the top of the tongue, both of which make it a snap to dial in the tension for a secure and stable hold of the foot. Our size 9.5 US test pair fits true to size with an average width that should work for most people’s feet. We’ve heard others mention the EU sizing runs a tad big, however, so it might be good to try these on before you buy to ensure you get the correct size. Despite their tough and almost rubbery feel, the synthetic uppers are quite supple and conform nicely to your foot shape, and the padded tongue keeps the Boa wires from digging into the tarsal bones. Generous padding in the heel/ankle pocket is both plush and protective, and small silicone dots at the back of the heel helps hold it in place. </p><p></p><p>The sole isn’t super stiff, but it feels very well-balanced, and at no point did it feel like it was sapping power or efficiency, even on long trail rides with lots of climbing. It’s also well-damped and absorbs trail feedback and vibration to keep your feet feeling fresh. Other than the cleat box, the sole is fully covered with Match MC1 rubber that provides great grip off the bike, and the horizontal tread at the toe and heel actually work to add some traction when walking in loose soils. Generous sole rocker and a little flex through the toes make walking feel impressively natural. A sturdy rubber bumper wraps up over the toes for protection from rock strikes and the whole package feels tough and well-made.</p><p></p><p>Though the Mallet Boa is billed as a downhill and enduro race shoe, the reasonable weight of 860g for the pair (size 43.5) makes them well suited to any type of riding you’re doing short of XC racing, and they quickly became the go-to for after-work trail rides. This versatility makes them a great candidate for a one-shoe quiver if you split your riding between the bike park, enduro laps, and trail riding.

The budget-friendly <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-roost-clip-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">2FO Roost Clip</a> and its flat-pedal twin, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-roost-flat-pedal-shoe-mens\">2FO Roost Flat</a>, were greeted with much fanfare when they were launched a short time ago. While not the least expensive shoe on the market or that we tested, we feel its ratio of price to performance makes it one of the best values out there. This versatile trail riding shoe is impressively lightweight, has casual styling, and has a well-rounded performance within its intended application.</p><p></p><p>Specialized markets the 2FO Roost Clip as a shoe that can seamlessly transition from riding to post-ride activities, and they gave it an understated style. Hidden beneath that casual appearance are some great features that help it perform out on the trail. A 3/4 length <em>Stiff Lollipop</em> nylon composite plate runs from the cleat mount area back and provides a surprisingly solid pedaling platform. The <em>Landing Strip</em> cleat box offers ample adjustment that should allow most riders to position their cleats in their preferred location. At the front of the shoe, the sole flexes quite naturally, allowing for a relatively natural gait whether you’re pushing your bike up a technical section of trail or wandering around the grocery store after your ride, and the full-coverage <em>SlipNot FG</em> rubber soles provide great traction on a wide range of surfaces and interface well with pedals for lateral stability.</p><p></p><p>The shoes have a “relaxed fit” and incorporate Specialized’s Body Geometry construction and footbeds designed to optimize your leg alignment, and we found that they cradle and secure the midfoot and heel very nicely. Our test pair fit true to their EU size for length. Simple laces tighten the shoes over the top of the foot, and the uppers are constructed from supple synthetic leather that is lined with breathable <em>AirMesh</em> material that wicks away sweat and adds a little cushioning. The midsole features EVA foam that helps to dampen vibration, and there is a little added protection in the form of a rubber bumper that wraps around the front of the toes. </p><p></p><p>All this comes at a shockingly low weight of just 750g for our size 43.5 test pair, which is lighter than most comparable shoes on the market. Our only real gripe with the 2FO Roost Clip is the roomy fit in the forefoot, and the inability to tighten that portion of the shoe for a more precise fit. That said, this will be fine for those who don’t require the tightest fit up at the front of the shoe, or for those who have slightly higher volume or wider-than-average feet. </p><p></p><p>Still, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-roost-clip-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Specialized 2FO Roost Clip</a> is a solid option that will meet most riders’ needs without breaking the bank, and they’ll look pretty good doing it too. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-roost-clip-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized 2FO Roost Clip action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Specialized-2FO-Roost-Clip-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Specialized 2FO Roost Clip is a reasonably priced do-it-all trail-riding shoe.

This top-of-the-line shoe has been around for many years and has seen incremental updates to help improve its performance while maintaining its signature, recognizable style, and top-shelf performance. It has some stiff competition from other high-end XC models, but the S-Phyre XC9 is still our favorite.</p><p></p><p>One of its standout features, of course, is its exceptional pedaling efficiency facilitated by the carbon fiber composite sole that is ultra-stiff with a stiffness index of 11 on Shimano’s scale. There is virtually zero flex in this sole, and all of your precious watts are transferred directly into the pedals. Dual Boa Li2 dials and a well-designed upper provide a very snug and secure fit that is not only comfortable but helps to maximize your power throughout the entire pedal stroke and helps to enhance control and stability. Weighing in at just 616g for the pair in a size 43.5, the XC9’s super light weight enhances efficiency even further.</p><p></p><p>The S-Phyre XC9 has a very precise fit that is on the narrow side of the spectrum in the “regular” width. Fortunately, they make a <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshimano-sh-xc9-s-phyre-bicycle-shoe-wide-mens\">wide version</a> of this shoe as well for those whose feet are wider than average. The closure system wraps around the foot for a very snug and secure hold, and the supple synthetic leather uppers conform to the feet very nicely. The thin, high-density footbed has adjustable arch support, and the textured material in the heel pocket locks the foot in and helps prevent any unwanted heel lift. These shoes essentially become an extension of your body. The heavily perforated uppers also do a great job of ventilating and allowing heat and moisture to escape. </p><p></p><p>Other than the immediate cleat mount zone, the carbon sole is completely covered in Shimano’s Ultread rubber. This helps to not only protect the carbon from damage but adds grip during those inevitable dismounts. The toe and heel feature aggressive lugs for additional traction in loose soils or mud, and the cleat mount zone is bordered by “pontoons” that interface with the pedal body and provide lateral stability. Shimano also includes a set of metal spikes that can be installed up at the toes for extra traction in extreme conditions you might encounter in a muddy cyclocross race. A rigid plastic heel cup and some light reinforcement around the toes add a small level of foot protection.</p><p></p><p>Given their outstanding performance, our complaints about the S-Phyre XC9 are few. As mentioned above, the fit of the latest version is relatively narrow, and we’d recommend that people try these on before they buy to ensure they work for your feet. Like most cross-country shoes, they also offer very little in the way of foot protection, and it’s best to avoid doing much walking or hike-a-bike in them. The price is also pretty hard to overlook but may be worth it for those seeking the performance this shoe provides. Like the sound of the S-Phyre XC9 but want to save a couple hundred bucks?

At a price that’s a fraction of the cost of the top-of-the-line models, these shoes offer the features and <em>most of</em> the performance we expect from XC shoes. These shoes are stiff, comfortable, and they look the part, without breaking the bank. </p><p></p><p>The Scott MTB Team Boa has a look reminiscent of the brand’s higher-end models. The shoes have an asymmetric, wrap-style tongue and single Boa IP1 dial pulls a wide flap over the upper and mid-foot with nice, even tension. A velcro strap over the lower foot is used to tighten the shoe closer to the toes. The overall fit is a touch roomier than the regular fit Shimano S-Phyre XC9 and the Fizik Vento Ferox Carbon, but we didn’t find it to be overly spacious either. The ErgoLogic footbed provides agreeable support and a very light level of cushioning. The synthetic upper can feel a little stiff initially, but we found them to break in and conform to the feet nicely after only a few test rides. Perforations in the uppers above the toes and on both sides of the feet do a commendable job of allowing the feet to breathe.</p><p></p><p>The sole is made with a nylon/glass fiber composite and has a stiffness index of 8. That’s compared to Scott’s top-of-the-line models that top out at 10 on their stiffness scale. While it isn’t the absolute stiffest shoe we tested, you’d be hard-pressed to notice any loss of power through sole flex. The cleat mount area offers a good range of adjustability that should be more than adequate for most users given the intended use of the Team Boa. The outsole features aggressive lugs at the toe and heel for traction should you ever have to get off and walk. The toe and heel also feature reinforced areas for a touch of foot protection and durability.</p><p></p><p>Like any other XC-oriented shoe, the foot protection offered by the Scott MTB Team Boa is fairly minimal compared to trail or gravity models. They’re okay to walk in, but these aren’t the shoes you want to be wearing for any extended hike-a-bikes. These also only come in full EU sizes between 40 and 48, so it can be a little harder for some people to get a precise fit without half sizes offered.</p><p></p><p>Those concerns aside, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fscott-mtb-team-boa-shoe-mens\">Scott MTB Team Boa</a> is a great option for the XC rider or racer on a budget.

The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-berm-mountain-bike-shoe\">Giro Berm</a> bucks that trend with a very wallet-friendly price, a high level of comfort, and a respectable on-trail performance. These shoes won’t blow you away with any one aspect of their performance, but they are simple and effective, leaving little to complain about. Especially when you take the price into consideration.</p><p></p><p>With two broad velcro straps as the closure, getting into, out of, and adjusting tension over the foot is quick and easy. Our size 44 test pair fit true to size in length, and the width is fairly average. There’s nothing particularly remarkable about their fit, but we found them to be surprisingly comfortable and very easy to get along with. There’s a decent amount of padding about the heel, some light reinforcement in front of the toes, and they offer protection similar to many trail-riding shoes. Despite their appearance, they also proved to be fairly well-ventilated with a large mesh panel over the toes and a few smaller mesh panels by the instep allowing for better-than-expected breathability. </p><p></p><p>The soles aren’t super stiff, but they’re not meant to be either. Under power, you can feel the sole flex slightly, especially when compared to stiffer XC shoes, but it isn’t egregious and we didn’t find that it caused foot or calf fatigue on the climbs or descents. That sole flex goes the other way too, and from the cleat mount area forward, it allows for a very natural walking motion. The outsole is fully covered in grippy rubber with a unique tread design that provides excellent traction on loose surfaces and rock. The cleats themselves sit just low enough to avoid clicking on the floor when you walk, and the tread on either side interfaces well with pedals. Our test pair also came with a “cover” that bolts into the cleat holes so you can use these shoes with flat pedals too.</p><p></p><p>Now, no one will mistake these shoes for their high-end counterparts, but that’s also not the point.

The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219613%2Ffox-union-boa-mountain-bike-shoes\">Union Boa</a> sits at the top-of-the-line model in their modest range of three shoes, and it quickly became a tester favorite for its versatility and all-around performance.</p><p></p><p>Fox took their time bringing shoes to market and they clearly did their homework and worked with several of the best mountain bikers on the planet during the development process. The three models include the Union Boa, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219614%2Ffox-union-mountain-bike-shoes\">Union</a> ($180), and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffox-racing-union-flat-moutain-bike-shoe-mens\">Union Flat </a>($150), all of which were designed to meet the demands of modern riders spanning from trail to downhill. The Union Boa features dual Boa Li2 closures, the Union is essentially the same shoe with laces and a velcro strap, while the Union Flat is designed for flat pedal riders with full coverage rubber soles and a lace closure.</p><p></p><p>While the Union Boa is used by downhill racers at the top end of the sport, we found it to be impressively versatile. This has to do with several factors, one of which is the reasonable weight. At just 867g for the pair in the size 9.5 US we tested, this is in the realm of most trail riding shoes, and makes it a viable option for those pedaling to the top of their descents or heading out for long, grueling trail rides. Another factor is the sole stiffness. The reinforced nylon shank provides a solid platform that provides excellent pedaling efficiency for most styles of riding short of XC racing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Fox didn’t stop there. The midsole is cushioned with EVA foam which helps to mute trail feedback on the descents. The molded toe cap and heel are reinforced to offer protection against rock strikes, and the shoe has a robust and tough feel. This is partially to do with the weather-resistant welded uppers that easily shrug off abrasion and water. The cleat box is long and offers ample adjustment range for folks to mount their cleats in their preferred location, plus it is surrounded by a full-coverage <em>Ultratac</em> rubber outsole for lateral stability on the pedals and traction off the bike.</p><p></p><p>The Union Boa has a “standard fit” that feels very average in terms of width and volume, and we found them to fit true to size when going off their US sizing (the EU sizing seems to run a bit smaller than other brands). The Boa dials make it quick and easy to get the shoes on and off and allow for on-the-fly tension adjustments. Additionally, Fox has included insoles with adjustable arch support, so you can hopefully dial it in to your needs. Perforations above the toes and on the sides of the foot do a commendable job of ventilating and allowing the feet to breathe on hot days.</p><p></p><p>Out of the box, we found the uppers to feel a bit stiff, but they broke in nicely after just a few rides. The stiff soles offer excellent power transfer, but the limited flex through the toes doesn’t make them the best for extended hike-a-bikes. They’re also fairly expensive, but you can opt for the standard Union with laces and a velcro strap and save yourself a bit of cash.

While they are certainly suitable for everyday trail riding, one of their greatest strengths is their performance off the bike. These shoes are comfortable, relatively lightweight, and offer a blend of on and off-the-bike performance that sets them apart from most other models on the market.</p><p></p><p>To be clear, these aren’t the highest-performance shoes around. Those seeking a super stiff sole and the utmost pedaling efficiency will be a little disappointed by the middling stiffness of the X-Alp Summit. For more casual trail riding, however, the nylon composite soles offer adequate stiffness assuming you aren’t trying to PR every climb. Their middle-of-the-road stiffness is also why they work so well off the bike. The soles have ample flex through the toes, and when combined with the aggressively lugged <em>Vibram ECOSTEP</em> rubber outsoles, they make walking in loose conditions or scrambling over chunky rocks feel quite similar to wearing hiking shoes. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the fit is fairly neutral, about average from the heel through the mid-foot, and slightly roomier up in the toe box. Folks with average to slightly above average width feet will get along with them well, but those with narrow feet may find them to be a little too roomy. The synthetic uppers are quite supple and relatively thin helping to give them a light and airy feel on the feet with ventilation enhanced by perforations above the toes and along the sides of the feet. A single Boa L6 dial pulls tension over the upper and mid-foot along with a velcro strap to snug things up down by the toes. The uppers aren’t the most supportive, but they certainly are quite comfortable. </p><p></p><p>While the X-Alp Summit shoes fit into their niche very nicely, they sacrifice a bit of performance in some key areas as a result. The soles are far from the stiffest out there, and you can feel it flex a tiny bit under hard pedaling efforts, and the cleat is slightly noticeable under the ball of the foot. They also offer very little in the way of foot protection, and vibration dampening isn’t on par with most of the trail or gravity shoes we tested. They also only come in whole EU sizes, so those between sizes may have a harder time getting the perfect fit. </p><p></p><p>Those concerns aside, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F176824%2Fpearl-izumi-x-alp-summit-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">Pearl Izumi X-Ap Summit</a> is a sensible option for the rider who prioritizes off-the-bike traction and walkability and wants a comfortable shoe that performs quite well on the bike too.

A staple in the Giro mountain bike shoe lineup for many years, the Chamber II remains a popular model among the gravity and enduro crowd and even some aggressive trail and all-mountain riders. These shoes are heavily padded and offer great foot protection, though they come with a bit of extra heft and bulk as a result.</p><p></p><p>One of the first things you’ll notice about the Chamber II is the plush and pillowy feel as there is a lot of cushioned padding around the ankle, heel, and tongue. Our size 44 test pair fit true to size with width and volume on the generous side of average that should work for a huge portion of riders. Simple laces work well to secure the shoe on the feet with a wide velcro strap at the top of the tongue to lock the heel down and secure your laces. The feet feel very well protected thanks in part to all the padding, but also the rubber toe cap and wider-than-average sole that helps ward off rock strikes. </p><p></p><p>Given their cushy comfort and skate-shoe styling, the soles with a “tri-molded shank” are stiffer than expected and provide a very solid pedaling platform while the EVA footbed and EVA midsole do a fine job of muting trail feedback and impacts. The entire sole is covered in <em>Vibram Megagrip</em> rubber for both pedal and off-the-bike grip, while a little flex in the forefoot allows for a relatively normal walking motion. The cleat box is offset heavily to the inside which helps avoid crank arm rub with the chunky soles, and Giro advertises a 10mm setback to the cleat mount zone compared to their regular shoes. This will likely be the sweet spot for a lot of riders, though it doesn’t have quite as much adjustment range as some other gravity shoes we tested. </p><p></p><p>All that pillowy comfort and foot protection does come with a bit of a weight penalty, and the Chamber II are the heaviest shoes we tested at 1,072g for our size 44 test pair. They’re also just generally kinda big and bulky compared to more streamlined models. Our only other qualm is that they only come in full EU sizes, so finding the perfect fit may be a little harder for some people.

The new <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-s-works-recon-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Specialized S-Works Recon</a> is their range-topping mountain bike shoe that is aimed squarely at the XC racing and gravel riding crowd. These shoes recently got a complete redesign, addressing some of the complaints about the previous version while making them lighter, sleeker, more accommodating, and better-looking than ever. </p><p></p><p>Many high-end XC racing shoes are essentially copies of road bike shoes, so it’s not too surprising that the S-Works Recon looks nearly identical to the S-Works Torch road shoe. Of course, there are some minor differences, but they are the same in many ways. One of those is the full carbon fiber sole that is incredibly stiff, thin, and lightweight with an “<em>Internal I-Beam” </em>for added strength. These soles have a very low stack and don’t flex under power no matter how hard you mash on the pedals. The uppers and closures are the same as the Torch as well, and while they are incredibly supple and comfortable, it’s easy to get a very snug, stable, and secure fit that helps further enhance both efficiency and control. </p><p></p><p>One of the big changes to the new S-Works Recon is more width in the forefoot which should be accommodating to more riders compared to the narrower fit of the previous version. While this may be slightly less ideal for those with narrow feet, the new arrangement of the dual Boa S3 dials manages to secure and snug the shoes for a precise fit and easy micro-adjustments. Additionally, the ankle cuff has been redesigned to be lower to prevent irritation and allow for excellent ankle mobility while the heel pocket is snug with friction material added to keep your heel firmly in place. Of course, Specialized has included their Body Geometry design into the shoe and footbed with the goal of aligning the lower leg and the footbed provides great support despite being thin and quite stiff.</p><p></p><p>The is a lot of visible carbon fiber on the sole of the S-Works Recon, but Specialized added beefy, but not replaceable, lugs at the toe and heel, a small patch of rubber under the instep, and large “pontoons” on either side of the cleat. The pontoons are “tuneable” and the shoes come with shims so you can adjust their height to dial in the shoe-pedal interface to your liking or specific pedals. Specialized also offers additional 3mm, 6mm, and 9mm shims and a cleat stacker should you need to account for leg length discrepancies. The aim of the tuneable pontoons is to provide a road bike-esque connection to the pedals for enhanced pedaling efficiency. In the stock configuration, our test shoes mated very well with all the different pedals we used them with.</p><p></p><p>Weight is also a concern for racers, so it’s not surprising that the S-Works Recon are absurdly lightweight. In fact, they are the lightest shoes we tested at just 590g for our size 43.5 test pair. This is particularly impressive given just how stiff, secure, and stable they are on the feet. Breathability is also fairly good, mostly due to the super thin and light construction of the shoes. </p><p></p><p>As with most XC racing shoes, foot protection is very minimal and is limited to a small rubber bumper in front of the toes and the asymmetrical plastic heel cup. There’s also virtually no sole dampening of any kind. And, while it is definitely possible to walk in these shoes, the unflinching stiffness of the sole and all the exposed carbon make these a very poor choice for rides that involve much, if any, time off the bike, especially if there are sharp rocks involved. They are also very, very expensive.

It’s still the burliest clipless model in the Five Ten lineup and is designed to meet the demands of downhill and enduro riders and racers. Given the significant reduction in weight compared to the old version, however, the Hellcat Pro’s appeal has expanded to include trail riders seeking extra foot protection on aggressive trails.</p><p></p><p>Despite the downhill focus of the Hellcat Pro, it has a surprisingly stiff sole that helps make it an efficient pedaler. Whether you’re grinding uphill for another lap or laying down the power in a sprint, there’s really no noticeable flex in the sole underfoot or torsionally. This translates to the descents as well, where the sole supports the foot and doesn’t flex around the pedal. It offers moderate vibration dampening, though not quite as much as some similar models. The sole features full coverage <em>Stealth Marathon</em> rubber with Five Ten’s signature raised dot tread pattern that provides good traction on firm surfaces and is harder-wearing than the rubber found on the brand’s flat pedal shoes. While these shoes are okay to walk in, the minimal sole rocker and stiffness through the toes make them feel a little blocky underfoot.</p><p></p><p>We found the Hellcat Pro to fit true to size with average volume through the mid-foot and a slightly roomier forefoot. The fit of these shoes will be welcome for those with wider feet but may prove to be a bit spacious for those on the narrow end of the spectrum. The laces work very well to secure the shoes snugly over the tops of the feet and the broad velcro strap at the top of the tongue helps keep the heel planted firmly in the heel pocket and keeps the laces tidy. A large mesh panel on the outside of the mid-foot and some perforations above the toes do a commendable job of ventilating, though these are far from the airiest shoes around. Given the gravity-oriented focus of the Hellcat Pro, foot protection levels are high, particularly at the front of the shoe where the toe box is heavily reinforced and coated in abrasion-resistant material. </p><p></p><p>While our test pair has held up well, we have seen friend’s Hellcat Pros suffer from sole delamination issues. A quick search online reveals that this isn’t an isolated problem, but it doesn’t affect all of the shoes either. It’s safe to assume that Adidas Five Ten is addressing the issue, and it is typically covered by warranty should yours suffer the same fate. </p><p></p><p>Based on our experience, however, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffive-ten-hellcat-pro-shoe-mens\">Five Ten Hellcat Pro</a> is a solid option for trail, enduro, and gravity riders seeking a protective and stiff shoe for tackling aggressive terrain and riding at high speeds.

These shoes borrow some features from Fizik’s popular road models, and they are lightweight, super stiff, and minimalist in their design. They also cost a fair bit less than other brands’ top-of-the-line models, though, at $300, they still aren’t exactly inexpensive either. </p><p></p><p>The Vento Ferox Carbon have, not surprisingly, a full X1 carbon sole that has a 10/10 on Fizik’s sole stiffness index. This stiffness is in line with their top road cycling shoes, on par with more expensive competitors, and ensures that none of your precious watts get wasted when smashing down on the pedals. Our size 43.5 test pair fit true to size with an average width that avoids being excessively narrow or too spacious. The uppers are made from a tough but thin and lightweight woven mesh and laminated upper secured over the foot with a Boa Li2 dial and a wide <em>Powerstrap</em> at the top of the tongue. We found it easy to crank these shoes down over the feet for a very snug and secure fit from the forefoot to the heel, and small grippy dots at the back of the heel pocket help to prevent any unwanted heel lift. This secure fit further enhances pedaling efficiency and power transfer throughout the entire pedal stroke. </p><p></p><p>Most of the carbon sole is covered by rubber with small lugs at the toes, larger lugs under the heel, and long pontoons bordering the cleat box. Not only does this protect the carbon from damage, but it also allows you to walk reasonably sure-footed, and the pontoons interface quite well with pedals for increased contact and stability. The Ferox Carbon is also ready to accept toe spikes for you CX racers, although it doesn’t come with them. Ventilation is a strong suit as the thin uppers allow plenty of air to reach the feet. The reinforced toe cap and rigid molded heel provide protection on par with other cross-country shoes, though it is quite minimal. </p><p></p><p>While the Vento Ferox Carbon are undoubtedly excellent shoes for laying down the power and maximizing your efficiency, we found that the minimalist design could lead to some minor discomfort over the course of longer rides. There is very little padding in the heel pocket or the tongue, and those with sensitive tarsal bones or heels may start to develop hot spots after several hours of riding, but this may not be an issue for everyone. Similarly, and this goes for most carbon-soled race shoes, the soles offer very little in the way of vibration dampening.

Though they aren’t quite as stiff or light as the top-of-the-line racing shoes we tested, they also cost significantly less and offer a more balanced performance that most non-racers and even some racers will likely prefer. </p><p></p><p>One of the primary things that sets the Sector apart from similarly styled shoes is the use of Giro’s <em>Synchwire</em> material. This mesh-like material is quite unique in that it is very flexible, incredibly air-permeable, yet still quite supportive. In the case of the Sector, it also has a “thermo-bonded exo structure” that provides a little additional support and structure to the uppers while still leaving plenty of room for these to be some of the best-ventilated shoes we tested. Slipping these shoes on, the comfort is immediately apparent as the uppers conform to the feet very easily and the Giro 3D molded medium arch support footbed cradles it nicely from below. Our size 43.5 test pair fit true to size with an average width and the dual Boa L6 dials secure the shoes over the top of the feet and allow for micro increases to tension or full macro-release. We found it easy to get these shoes as tight as you want to really lock your feet and heels in place. </p><p></p><p>The sole is made with a carbon composite plate that is adequately stiff for most types of riding. It can’t match the unrivaled stiffness of full carbon soles, but instead, it feels solid underfoot while remaining a bit more forgiving than full-on race shoes. This is particularly noticeable over the course of a long gravel ride or chunky mountain bike descent, as they don’t punish your feet the way that some stiffer shoes can. Pedaling efficiency isn’t top of the heap, though it isn’t far off thanks to the relatively stiff sole and precise fit. The sole is covered in rubber from front to back to provide off-the-bike grip and a reasonable walking experience. The lack of well-defined lugs, however, doesn’t give them the best traction in loose dry, or muddy conditions. </p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a super comfortable and well-ventilated shoe for light trail, cross-country, or gravel riding, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-sector-cycling-shoe-mens\">Giro Sector</a> is a great option that looks good, fits great, and isn’t super expensive.

They claim it “pairs XC performance with Five Ten’s gravity credentials and mountain bike expertise,” and it is marketed as a “<em>down-country</em>” shoe with some design elements that speak to the brand’s roots. </p><p></p><p>The previous Kestrel Pro Boa was a beefy shoe for aggressive trail riders and enduro racers, and the new version resembles its predecessor in name only. This shoe is entirely new and is aimed squarely at the growing <em>down-country</em> market that has been spurred on by the evolution of more capable XC bikes. The full-length glass-fiber reinforced sole is very stiff and power transfer felt on par with some of the more expensive competition. This took us somewhat by surprise actually, as we didn’t expect such good pedaling efficiency. The heel pocket is well-shaped, and the Boa closure over the upper foot does a great job of locking the heel down in place. </p><p></p><p>While some of the rigid sole is exposed, much of it is covered in Five Ten’s signature <em>Stealth Marathon</em> rubber. This includes a small patch under the instep, as well as aggressive lugs at the toe and heel that provide excellent traction in loose soils. While the soles are quite stiff, these shoes are a bit more friendly to walk in than some similar models. The cleat bolt channels offer a huge range of adjustment, especially for an XC shoe, and are bordered by two large pontoons that help you stabilize on the pedals. Additionally, Five Ten added a beefy piece of rubber that wraps up and over the toes to ward off rock strikes when you’re getting aggressive on your XC rig. </p><p></p><p>Our size 9.5 US test pair fit true to size in length. They have a nice snug fit in the heel and ankle and are slightly higher volume in the forefoot than most other XC shoes. We’ve read complaints from others that they weren’t able to adequately tension the shoes over the forefoot, but despite having relatively skinny feet, our lead tester was able to get his snug enough with the two velcro straps. This issue could easily be remedied with a higher-volume aftermarket footbed, and may actually be a benefit for those with slightly above-average width/volume feet. We got along fine with the fit, but it may be worth trying these on before you buy to make sure the volume jives with your feet.</p><p></p><p>The ventilated mesh panel above the toes and on both sides of the feet works effectively.

They essentially took their popular Hellion flat pedal shoes and added a cleat plate and a velcro strap at the top of the tongue, and voila. Our lead tester has been riding in these shoes off and on for the past year and has definitely put them through the wringer and has come away mostly impressed by their performance. Ride Concepts also makes a full line of women’s shoes including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-hellion-clip-mountain-bike-shoe-womens\">Hellion Clip Women’s</a>. </p><p></p><p>One of the things that stands out about the Hellion Clip is their sturdy and robust feel. The supportive uppers provide excellent stability along with a reinforced toe cap and padded heel/ankle that provide ample foot protection for everything from aggressive trail riding to bike park use. The cushioned EVA midsole does a great job of absorbing and muting trail feedback, and along with insoles that feature D30 padding under the heel and forefoot, provide comfort on long, rough descents. </p><p></p><p>Out of the box, we found the Hellion Clip to fit true to size in length with a relatively snug initial fit. After a few rides, the upper broke in quite nicely and has stayed snug and secure, with a glove-like feel. As advertised, these are relatively low-volume shoes that should work well for those with narrow to average-width feet. The lace closure is simple and effectively tensions the shoe over the upper and midfoot and the velcro strap ensures that your heel stays securely in the heel pocket. They lack the on-the-fly-adjustability of the Boa-equipped models, but we rarely found the need to adjust the laces once these shoes were on. </p><p></p><p>Given their skate shoe-esque looks, the Hellion Clip shoes are surprisingly stiff underfoot and provide an efficient pedaling experience. The <em>RC Powerdrive</em> nylon shank provides the support, and there’s really no discernible flex under power and it feels very stable laterally as well. The entire sole, minus the cleat box, is covered in <em>Clip Grip</em> rubber which provides good grip and off-the-bike walking traction. They don’t have a lot of flex through the toe, but there is just enough to prevent them from feeling too blocky or wooden when walking.</p><p></p><p>Compared to some similar models we tested, the Hellion Clip is a little bit heavier, weighing in at 960g for the pair in a size 9.5 US. That’s about 100g more than the Fox Union Boa or the Crankbrothers Mallet Boa in the same size. Not a deal breaker, but notable if you’re concerned at all about weight. Also, the grip of the velcro on the strap has degraded over the course of the past year of use, and though it still works, it seems like a bit of a weak point in these otherwise durable shoes. Despite these concerns, we’d recommend the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-hellion-clip-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Ride Concepts Hellion Clip</a> to anyone seeking a versatile shoe with a precise fit that can handle everything from trail riding to bike park days.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-hellion-clip-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZVPHVZT/?tag=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-terra-atlas-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFizik Terra Atlas\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$160</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight (pair)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>758g (43.5)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Closure</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>single Boa dial</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Intended Use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>trail riding, gravel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>36-48 EU (half sizes 37.5-46.5)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fizik-Terra-Atlas.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"633\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fizik-Terra-Atlas.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fizik-Terra-Atlas.jpeg 633w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fizik-Terra-Atlas-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fizik-Terra-Atlas-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Supple uppers conform nicely to the feet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good off the bike traction</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Pretty good ventilation</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not the best power transfer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Uppers aren't the most supportive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-terra-atlas-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Fizik Terra Atlas</a> is a moderately priced shoe that combines a comfortable fit with an all-around performance that many riders will appreciate. While it may not be the lightest or stiffest shoe around, they offer a nice balanced ride that should work for everything from casual XC riding to gravel or bike packing for riders without competitive aspirations.  </p><p></p><p>The Terra Atlas has a nylon plate to provide pedaling support and it falls at a 5 out of 10 on Fizik’s sole stiffness scale. While it is certainly noticeably flexy under very hard efforts compared to the 10-rated Fizik Veto Ferox Carbon, we didn’t find it to be excessively soft under power or fatiguing to the lower legs or feet. Ample flex through the toe of the shoe allows for a natural feeling walking motion off the bike, and the grippy rubber outsole provides good traction on most surfaces. The cleat mount area offers a generous adjustment range that should accommodate most riders’ preferences.</p><p></p><p>The supple uppers of the Terra Atlas feel great right out of the box and we found the length to be true to size in our 43.5 EU test pair. The width feels a touch wider than other Fizik shoes we’ve tested but not excessively voluminous. A single Boa dial pulls tension over the asymmetric opening and tongue of the shoe to tighten the entire thing from the top down to the forefoot. While this works okay, it can be a little tricky to get even tension throughout, especially if you need to decrease volume closer to the toes. This seems partially due to the fact that the wires crisscross and tend to hang up on each other. And, while we found the supple uppers to be very comfortable, they aren’t the most supportive. </p><p></p><p>The uppers and tongue are heavily perforated and do a good job of ventilating the feet. The construction seems solid too, with good attention to detail and quality craftsmanship. Foot protection, however, is quite limited, so that’s something to be aware of depending on the type of riding that you’re doing. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-terra-atlas-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Fizik Terra Atlas</a> is a versatile and comfortable shoe for those who aren’t too concerned with having super stiff soles. They feel good on the feet and we think they look pretty good too. They come in whole EU sizes between 36 and 47 as well as half sizes from 38.5 to 46.5. In addition to the pink/grape color we tested, they come in more subtle black, grey/black, and army (green)/black color options.  </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-terra-atlas-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WVKCX7G/?tag=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-hummvee-clipless-shoe-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEndura Humvee Clipless\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$130</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight (pair)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>942g (9.5 US)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Closure</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Laces, velcro strap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Intended Use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Trail, gravity</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>38-47 EU (half sizes 41.5-45.5)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless.jpeg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Endura-Humvee-Clipless-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Protective</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Casual style</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonable price</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not the best power transfer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Cleats stand proud of sole</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not well ventilated</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Endura launched a line of shoes in early 2022 with the MT500 Burner coming in both flat and clipless options and the Humvee Flat as a more budget-friendly flat pedal option. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-hummvee-clipless-shoe-mens\">Endura Humvee Clipless</a> is the latest addition to the lineup and is essentially the Humvee Flat pedal shoe that’s been adapted to work with clipless pedals. Endura basically added a cleat box and cleat plate to the modestly priced flat pedal version to create this versatile clip-in shoe that is aimed at everyone from trail to gravity riders. It shares the same casual, skate-shoe-esque looks as the flat model and comes in at a similarly palatable price. </p><p></p><p>The Humvee Clipless fits true to size and offers a bit more overall volume than similar shoes like the Ride Concepts Hellion Clip. The shoe is generously padded and has a plush, comfortable feel straight out of the box. The laces do a great job of securing the shoes over the top of the foot, the heavily padded tongue plays nice with the tarsal bones, and the velcro strap at the top of the tongue holds your heel down in the heel pocket. Ample reinforcement around the toes provides great protection from rock strikes, and the shoes have a robust and well-made feel to them. </p><p></p><p>The cleat box offers a wide range of adjustment and should even please those who like to slam their cleats as far back as possible. They aren’t intended to be the stiffest shoes out there, instead offering a more forgiving sole that flexes a bit underfoot which may appeal to many riders. We’d definitely recommend pairing these with mid to large-cage clipless pedals that provide a little additional support. The midsole also provides a good level of vibration dampening for those rough, chunky descents. </p><p></p><p>We have a few minor complaints about the Humvee Clipless. First, when pedaling, you can feel the cleat a little through the sole of the shoe, and the softer sole flexes noticeably under hard efforts. Second, the cleat itself stands a little taller than the sole surrounding the cleat box. This results in a clicking of the cleat on the floor when you walk, and the sole on either side of the cleat doesn’t interface as well with certain pedals as it could. Lastly, the uppers and plush lining of the shoes don’t offer the best ventilation, and they can be a bit warm on the feet on hotter days. </p><p></p><p>Still, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-hummvee-clipless-shoe-mens\">Endura Humvee Clipless</a> is an attractive option for those who seek a forgiving, comfortable, and protective shoe for trail, enduro, or gravity riding. They look good, and the price is easy to stomach. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Writing about bikes isn’t just a job, it’s our passion, and we love trying out new and interesting products of all kinds for reviews or to find the best options to enhance our experience, enjoyment, and performance out on the roads or trails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mountain bike shoe review author, Jeremy Benson, has been professionally testing and reviewing mountain bike gear for the past 8 years and has tested over thirty different pairs of clipless mountain bike shoes in that time. Having started mountain biking in the early 1990s, he’s witnessed and experienced the evolution of clipless mountain bike shoes firsthand. From gravel and XC racing, all-day backcountry epics, and shuttle runs on steep skidders, he appreciates all types of riding and understands the needs of different riders and riding styles. His extensive testing experience has also resulted in a keen ability to discern the performance differences in the products he uses. In addition to mountain bike shoes, Jeremy has tested and reviewed the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/\">best mountain bike helmets</a> to keep your head safe and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/\">best hitch bike racks</a> for transporting your precious rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best models available in 2023, we rounded up a selection of 16 different models to test and compare side by side. Each pair was thoroughly tested over the course of several months (some models for well over a year) to determine their strengths and weaknesses and how they perform in the real world. Each pair was weighed for consistency and comparison to the manufacturer’s claims, and important performance characteristics like fit, comfort, ventilation, pedaling efficiency, foot protection, and walkability were scrutinized out on the trail.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Different types of mountain bike shoes we tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Type-of-mountain-bike-shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The type of shoe that works best for you will depend primarily on the type of riding you do. Fortunately, there are loads of different models to suit varying needs and preferences.

We put together this buying advice that goes over the things you need to consider when making your purchase decision. Please note that this review and the information below are specific to clipless mountain bike shoes, which are shoes that accept cleats that clip in to the pedals (confusing, we know). Flat pedal riders fear not, we have tested the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">best flat pedals</a> and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-flat-pedal-shoes/\">best flat pedal shoes</a> if you prefer not to clip in. For the roadies, we have a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">comprehensive road bike shoe</a> review as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Mountain Bike Shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the various categories that mountain biking is divided into, it comes as little surprise that we have shoes specialized to meet the varying needs of riders and riding styles. In general, mountain biking can be broken into three primary categories, cross-country, trail/all-mountain, and gravity. We explain the primary differences in design and performance between the types of shoes below. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Cross-country mountain bike shoes action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-mountain-bike-shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Shoes designed for cross-country racing and riding typically have streamlined designs, stiff soles, and light weights intended to enhance efficiency while pedaling.

XC riding is about speed and efficiency, so cross-country shoes are designed with low weight and efficient power transfer as priorities. This is particularly true in XC racing, where high-end shoes can provide marginal gains that can be the difference between a podium or a mid-pack performance. Cross-country shoes typically have stiff soles, sometimes made from carbon fiber or rigid plastic, that provide a direct transfer of power into the pedals with little to no energy wasted through sole flex. They also typically have sleek, low-profile uppers that provide a snug and secure fit. Given the stiffness and support of the soles, this style of shoe works well with small, lightweight pedals that don’t have any platform or cage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the prioritization of weight and sole stiffness in the design of cross-country shoes, they do make some compromises in other areas. They generally provide much less protection for the feet compared to trail or gravity-oriented models. Stiff soles also don’t tend to provide much in the way of vibration dampening, so they can be a little harsher on the feet over rough terrain and long descents. Walking and hiking also tend to be less natural and comfortable given the stiffness of the soles, and the outsole designs. Regardless, if moving fast uphill and across the flats is your goal, cross-country shoes are generally the best bet. Often, this style of shoe also works great for gravel riding and/or on the road bike. Examples of cross-country shoes include the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshimano-sh-xc9-s-phyre-bicycle-shoe-mens\">Shimano S-Phyre XC9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-s-works-recon-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Specialized S-Works Recon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-vento-ferox-carbon-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Fizik Vento Ferox Carbon</a>, and Giro Sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Out for a trail riding testing the best mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-mountain-bike-shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Trail riding shoes typically offer good pedaling efficiency along with features and performance that make them highly versatile and great for long days in the saddle. (photo: Heather Benson) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Trail and All-Mountain Shoes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoes designed for trail riding are the happy medium between the stiff, efficiency-oriented cross-country models and the protective gravity-focused options. Trail shoes tend to be highly versatile and span the largest range of riding styles and uses. Most are still reasonably lightweight and provide efficient power transfer, though it is not the singular focus like with cross-country shoes. Trail shoes also typically provide a higher level of foot protection, but not quite as much as downhill shoes. Outsole designs vary, but most now feature grippy rubber soles with flex through the toe to facilitate more natural walking and traction for those inevitable hike-a-bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoes like these that can do it all inevitably make some minor compromises. They aren’t quite stiff or light enough to be the best option for cross-country racing. Likewise, they don’t provide the level of foot protection most riders seek for true downhill riding. Still, trail riding shoes like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-roost-clip-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Specialized 2FO Roost Clip</a> are typically the best option for the vast majority of riders. Other models like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-mallet-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Crankbrothers Mallet Boa</a> and the Ride Concepts Hellion Clip provide enough foot protection for enduro riding and even downhill, yet they are versatile enough to be great trail riding shoes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Enduro Shoes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Enduro-style riding and racing is essentially a gravity-focused discipline, and the preferred shoes for this type of riding are often those designed for gravity riding. Still, with timed downhill stages and untimed uphill transfers, enduro riders do enough pedaling that efficiency is often still a consideration. For this reason, beefier and more protective trail/all-mountain shoes are often a good choice, and the new breed of moderate-weight gravity shoes are typically solid options for this type of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-mountain-bike-shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Gravity shoes typically prioritize foot protection and durability, although many new models are less bulky and heavy than they used to be. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Gravity Shoes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravity riders who spend their days riding chairlifts or shuttling the uphills to ride rough and steep trails or hit massive jumps typically seek shoes that provide more foot protection and somewhat more forgiving sole designs. Gravity shoes tend to be a bit bulkier with more cushioning in the uppers and protective zones integrated around the toes, heels, and sometimes the ankles. With less emphasis on efficiency, the soles are generally not as stiff and they usually incorporate some vibration-dampening material like EVA foam in the midsole to absorb some trail feedback and impact. These features typically result in shoes that are a bit heavier, though that is a tradeoff for the protection and comfort they provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, gravity shoes can be worn for everyday trail riding, though they may be overkill in many situations. Still, trail riders seeking added foot protection and cushioning often opt for this style of shoe, particularly if their riding leans towards the more aggressive side of the spectrum and they don’t mind a little extra weight in exchange. Many of the latest gravity shoes, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219613%2Ffox-union-boa-mountain-bike-shoes\">Fox Union Boa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffive-ten-hellcat-pro-shoe-mens\">Five Ten Hellcat Pro</a> are lighter and less bulky than older models, expanding their versatility and making them viable options for trail riding as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Type of Riding Do You Do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of riding you do will be the primary factor to consider when choosing the right pair of mountain bike shoes. If the majority of your riding falls into a specific category like cross-country or gravity, shoes designed for that specific purpose will serve you the best. If you’re more of a generalist, then a versatile trail-riding shoe is probably the way to go. If you dabble in multiple disciplines, having multiple different pairs of shoes to match the type of riding you’re doing is not uncommon. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A selection of mountain bike pedals for various disciplines\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Types-of-mountain-bike-pedals-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>There are lots of options when it comes to clipless mountain bike pedals. Different styles of pedals work better for different types of riding and styles of shoes. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pedals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like your shoes, clipless pedals come in a variety of styles that may provide distinct performance advantages for certain types of riding. The clip mechanisms themselves vary somewhat between brands, although the general idea is the same. Clipping into your pedals secures the foot to the pedal in the optimal position. The optimal position varies by personal preference, but also by use case. Typically XC riders have a slightly more forward cleat position to optimize pedaling efficiency, while most gravity riders have a rearward-biased cleat position to enhance stability when descending. Thankfully, most shoes have a relatively wide cleat adjustment range so most people will be able to position their cleats in their desired location. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among mountain bike pedals, the Shimano SPD system and cleat are generally the most common. Other brands like Crankbrothers, Time, HT, Hope, etc, use proprietary cleats for their pedals, but they all share the same two-bolt attachment. There are few actual “standards” in the bike industry, but the two-bolt cleat interface for mountain bike shoes is one that is actually a standard. Phew.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Examples of mountain bike pedals for cross-country riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cross-country-pedals-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Cross-country pedals like the Look X-Track Race Carbon, HT M2, and Time ATAC XC 8 (left to right), are smaller and lightweight, and they work best with stiff-soled shoes.

They typically consist of a spindle and a small pedal body that is essentially just the clip mechanism, often with a small platform to either side for some lateral support. They usually prioritize light weight, and the majority of the support comes from the stiff sole of your shoes. Examples include models like Crankbrothers Eggbeaters, HT M2, Time XC 8, and Shimano XTR PD-M9100.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Examples of mountain bike pedals for trail riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trail-pedals-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Trail riding pedals usually have small to mid-sized cages surrounding the clip mechanism like the Crankbrothers Mallet Trail, Shimano XT Trail, HT T2, and Hope Union TC pictured here.

Designs vary, but typically the cage is intended to provide a little additional support when clipped in or something to stand on if you happen to clip out. The larger pedal body is also helpful for finding and orienting the pedal beneath your foot when clipping in. Some designs feature traction pins that can add grip when used with certain shoes. Examples of trail pedals are the Shimano XT Trail, Crankbrothers Mallet Trail, HT T2, Time Speciale 8, and other similar models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Examples of mountain bike pedals for gravity riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gravity-pedals-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Gravity pedals like the Time Speciale 12 and DMR V-Twin pictured above tend to have larger platforms surrounding the clip mechanism for additional support and stability. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Gravity Pedals</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Downhill riders typically opt for pedals that have a large platform surrounding the clip mechanism. The larger platform helps provide support for the comparatively softer-soled gravity shoes, both fore and aft, and side to side. The added support is critical and provides extra control when piloting your bike through rough terrain at high speeds. These pedals often resemble a flat pedal with a clip mechanism in the center, and they often have traction pins for added grip. Examples of gravity pedals include the Time Speciale 12, Shimano Saint, DMR V-Twin, and Crankbrothers Mallet DH.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting the Right Fit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the right type of shoe to suit your needs and riding style is very important, but finding the right fit will enhance your control and ensure your comfort on the bike. Too loose and your feet can move around resulting in a reduction of control, while shoes that are too tight can cause discomfort, hot spots, and even numb feet. Properly fitting shoes should be the appropriate length, width, and volume, with closures that wrap the feet snugly and securely. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Mountain bike shoe sizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-sizes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Getting the correct size is super important. As you can see, there is some variance among brands’ sizing, even for shoes that are technically the same size. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sizing</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting the right size is the important first step. Like any other type of shoes, mountain bike shoes come in a range of sizes that are typically listed in EU, US, and UK sizes. If you are unsure of your size, you can get your feet measured at most bike shops or you can do it at home (it’s easy to find helpful tips for measuring your feet online). If you have mountain bike shoes that fit well, it’s often as easy as checking the size and ordering the same thing, especially if it is the same brand. This doesn’t always hold true, however, as there is some variance between brands and how their EU and US/UK sizes line up on the size chart. Whenever possible, we recommend trying shoes on before you buy to ensure they fit correctly. When trying shoes on, it’s also important to wear the socks you’ll be riding in, as sock thickness can directly impact how a shoe fits. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Width and Volume</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Width and volume are also important considerations that can make or break the fit of a shoe. Most shoes come in a “regular” width that is intended to fit the majority of people whose feet are neither very wide nor very skinny. For this reason, people with average-width feet generally have the easiest time finding shoes that fit them properly in terms of width and volume. In general, cross-country shoes tend to have slightly narrower and lower-volume fits. Thankfully, some brands offer wide or high-volume versions to accommodate those with wider feet. Trail and gravity shoes vary in terms of width, but generally speaking, they typically have a little more room in the forefoot than the snugger-fitting cross-country models. It is also worth noting that most shoes will break in slightly over time as the uppers conform to your feet. Some shoes that feel too tight out of the box may end up being the perfect fit after a few rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"The adjustable arch support insoles of the Fox Union Boa\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fox-Union-Boa-Adjustable-Arch-Support-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Some high-end shoes include insoles with adjustable arch support, including the Fox Union Boa.

Typically, people who pedal hard and put in long miles want to ensure their feet and lower legs stay in the optimal alignment for transferring power. Those with high arches also benefit from having an insole that provides adequate support. Some shoes, typically high-end cross-country shoes, come with insoles that have adjustable arch support. The majority of mountain bike shoes, however, tend to come with relatively basic insoles. Those with specific arch support needs and wants can often benefit from the use of aftermarket or custom insoles. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-800x533.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shimano-S-Phyre-XC9-sole-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Stiff soles, like the carbon soles with a stiffness rating of 11 on the Shimano S-Phyre XC, combined with a precise fit typically result in the highest level of pedaling efficiency. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pedaling Efficiency</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bike shoes are our connection to the pedals and how our pedaling power gets transferred into forward motion. The stiffness of a shoe’s sole is a major factor that dictates how efficiently your power is transferred, and they vary pretty significantly based on materials used and intended use. Pedaling efficiency is prioritized most by cross-country riders, particularly racers, who aim to maximize their effort, so XC shoes typically have the stiffest soles, often constructed from carbon fiber or rigid plastic. These soles flex very little, if at all, and tend to be a little less forgiving and more difficult to walk in. Price and sole stiffness often go hand in hand, with stiff, race-oriented models often employing carbon fiber in their soles and commanding a lofty price tag. It isn’t just the sole’s stiffness, however, as a precise fit is equally important to keep the foot from moving around to maximize efficiency throughout the whole pedal stroke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoes designed for trail riding typically have a more balanced sole that is stiff enough for efficiency during long days in the saddle, but has some forgiveness in the design to enhance rider comfort and walkability. Trail shoes often employ stiffening plates, or shanks, in the soles that often run about 3/4 of the length of the shoe, providing structure from about the ball of the foot back to the heel. This provides support underfoot when descending and pushing on the pedals while leaving the sole under the toes and forefoot somewhat flexible for walking. Gravity-oriented shoes often employ similar designs, although some are intended to have a little more flex and forgiveness. They also typically have additional vibration-dampening materials built into the mid-soles to absorb more trail feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Mountain Bike Shoe closure options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-Bike-Shoe-Closures-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Boa dials, laces, velcro straps, maybe a combination of two. There are many different closure systems and designs among modern mountain bike shoes. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Closures</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to getting the right fit, having the shoe be snug and secure around your foot is important for comfort, control, and stability. Shoe manufacturers use a number of different methods for tightening the shoe around your foot, including laces, velcro straps, ratcheting buckles, Boa dials, and sometimes a combination of two closure types. Personal preference often dictates what someone chooses, and some shoes are even offered in multiple closure options. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-mallet-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Crankbrothers Mallet shoes</a> come in Boa, Speed Lace, and Lace versions with the primary difference being price. It stands to reason that the fancier closure systems tend to add a little to the overall price of a pair of shoes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Price isn’t the only difference, however, and each closure style has some benefits and drawbacks. Laces are the simplest option and they are cheap and easy to replace. They pull tension evenly over the top of the foot, but they are slower to put on/take off, and they can’t be adjusted on the fly. Velcro straps are often used on their own or in combination with laces, Boas, or ratchets either down by the toes or up at the top of the tongue. Velcro is quick and easy to adjust, but it does tend to wear out more quickly than other closures. Boa dials are typically found on more expensive shoes, and they tighten small wires over the top of the foot. Boa dials are lightweight and very easy to adjust, even while riding, but they can be more prone to damage from impact than other styles of closures. Ratchet straps are less common than they used to be, but they are still used on some models of shoes. Ratchet straps use a small plastic ladder strap and a ratcheting buckle to add tension over the foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Examples of different outsole designs on mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Outsole-designs-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The outsole designs of modern mountain bike shoes vary pretty significantly depending on the intended use. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Outsole Design</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Outsole designs vary wildly between different models and styles of shoes and play a direct role in how easy it is to walk in some shoes and the traction they provide. Given that we’re discussing shoes designed to clip-in to your pedals, sole grip isn’t nearly as important as it is for flat pedal shoes where you rely on the sole for your connection to the pedal pins. That said, those who ride trails that require dismounting for challenging sections or who hike a bike frequently will want to consider that when choosing a pair of mountain bike shoes. Cross-country shoes tend to have stiff carbon or plastic soles, and they typically have some rubber tread lugs added to the toe, heel, and on both sides of the cleat mount area. These tread lugs add some lateral stability on the pedal, grip when walking, and protect the rigid soles slightly from damage. Many cross-country shoes can also have toe spikes added, which is common in cyclocross racing for added grip on muddy courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern trail and gravity shoes usually have full-coverage soles made from various rubber compounds. These tend to cover the entire sole of the shoe from toe to heel with only the cleat mount area left exposed. The tread designs vary from brand to brand, but most intend for the sole to provide grip on varying surfaces. The cleat sits in a recess in the sole and good designs allow for the outsole on the sides of the cleats to interface with the pedal body for lateral stability. Some trail riding shoes are designed for adventurous riding that includes pushing your bike up steep slopes, and these often feature lugged tread designs more akin to a hiking shoe’s sole.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Hiking back up to session a small feature in the Shimano ME7\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simano-ME7-Hiking-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Whether you’re sessioning a feature, hiking to a vista, or the steepness of the trail forces you to dismount your bike, we often end up walking/hiking in our mountain bike shoes. Fortunately, many modern shoes have grippy rubber and tread designs that perform well off the bike. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Walkability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the type of riding you do, a shoe’s walkability may or may not be a concern. If your rides tend to be on mellower terrain where you stay on the bike the majority of the time, it likely doesn’t matter much how easy your shoes are to walk in. If you ride more adventurous terrain or like to scramble up to every viewpoint along the ride, then a shoe that performs reasonably well off the bike might be of greater importance. It stands to reason that shoes with more flexible soles and rubber in the outsole design will be easier to walk in and provide more traction on rock and variable surfaces. Most modern trail and gravity shoes work well in this regard with a select few having particular emphasis on off-the-bike traction in their sole’s design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-country shoes tend to be the least pleasant to walk in given their stiff soles that inhibit a natural gait. Most have a slight bit of rocker through the toe along with raised rubber sole lugs for some grip, but they are not usually the optimal choice for those who dismount their bikes frequently. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Comaprison shot of the Five Ten Kestrel Boa and the Five Ten Hellcat Pro mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Shoes-foot-protection-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Many mountain bike shoes prioritize foot protection in their designs.

The Five-Ten Kestrel Boa (left) is more of a trail/XC hybrid that has more toe protection than a typical cross-country shoe. (photo: Jeremy Benson) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Foot Protection</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The protection of one’s feet while riding varies in importance between the different riding styles, although nearly all mountain bike shoes provide some level of foot protection in their designs. Even thin, lightweight cross-country shoes have firm heel cups and small bumpers surrounding the front of the toes, but their prioritization of weight savings typically results in shoes that provide little additional foot protection. For this reason, they are best suited to less technical terrain, where the likelihood of rock strikes and other impacts to the feet is generally lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trail shoes typically offer more protection than XC shoes with thicker uppers and strategically placed padding or rigid materials to protect the feet in more varied terrain. They also generally have more cushioning integrated into the midsoles for vibration absorption on rough trails. Gravity shoes like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-chamber-ii-cycling-shoe-mens\">Giro Chamber II</a> tend to offer the highest levels of foot protection with rigid toe caps, extra cushioning, and sometimes additional materials like D30 patches for added impact protection in key areas. Extra foot protection tends to add weight and gravity shoes are generally heavier and bulkier than other styles of shoes as a result. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"The highly breathable Giro Synchwire material\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Giro-Synchwire-breathability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Manufacturers use various methods to make shoes ventilated and breathable including perforations or mesh panels on the uppers, or the super air-permeable Synchwire material used on the Giro Sector. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Breathability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoe manufacturers approach breathability and ventilation in various ways with nearly all mountain bike shoes having some sort of way for air to enter or escape in their designs. How effectively these designs work varies significantly, and how important this is to you depends on several factors, of course, like the climate where you live and ride, what type of riding you do, and how much you sweat. Ventilating features include mesh panels, perforations in the uppers, or uppers constructed from air-permeable materials. Not surprisingly, lightweight XC shoes designed for high-intensity riding typically do well here thanks to thinner uppers and less bulk in their designs. The<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-sector-cycling-shoe-mens\"> Giro Sector</a>, for example, is one of the best-ventilated shoes we tested thanks to its airy <em>Synchwire</em> material.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trail and gravity shoes, generally speaking, tend to be a little warmer on the feet due to the thicker materials and additional cushioning and protection they provide. This tends to be least important for gravity riders where the majority of your time is spent riding downhill instead of pedaling up it. Still, most models make some attempt at ventilating the feet, though the effectiveness of their designs varies. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mountain-bike-shoes-durability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Mountain bike shoes take some serious abuse, and none will last forever, but we always to hope to get our money’s worth. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Durability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like anything else in mountain biking, your shoes take a beating and they wear out over time. People who ride every day or are particularly hard on gear may easily go through a pair of shoes in a season from regular use. Less frequent riders should expect to get several seasons of use from a quality pair of shoes. Of course, there are a number of factors that will play a role in how long your bike shoes last. Terrain, weather, and even your skills make a difference and will dictate the lifespan of your footwear. Awkward dismounts, repeated scrapes against sharp rocks, or constantly being wet can result in damage to your uppers, while excessive walking on sharp rocks may result in the premature breakdown of your soles. Sometimes manufacturing defects will result in sole delamination or other issues (most brands warranty shoes with defects). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, lighter, thinner shoes tend to be the most susceptible to damage and can wear out most easily if not treated with care. Beefier, burlier shoes often have extra materials in high-wear areas to protect from abrasion. Velcro tends to wear out faster than other closure types, and it can’t really be replaced. Laces can tear or break, but they are affordable and easy to replace. Boa dials have a checkered past from a durability standpoint, though they can often be replaced and are sometimes covered by warranty. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Value</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of mountain bike shoes varies pretty significantly with the models we tested ranging from $80 up to $450. Typically, the most expensive shoes are the highest performance, although that performance will only really be appreciated by certain riders for very specific reasons. Unless you’re a cross-country racer seeking marginal performance gains from the lightest and stiffest shoes, you don’t need to spend that much. The $150 to $250 price range will be where most people find the best price-to-performance ratio. While not the highest performance, even a shoe like the $80 <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-berm-mountain-bike-shoe\">Giro Berm</a> gets the job done pretty well for less frequent riders or those on a budget. Of course, we haven’t tested every single shoe on the market, and there may be other great value options not listed here. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions About Mountain Bike Shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why Should I Wear Mountain Bike Shoes?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Sure, you can ride a mountain bike in just about any shoes you want, but mountain bike shoes are always our recommendation because they are specifically designed for that purpose. If you mountain bike once or twice a year, it may not be worth it to you to spring for mountain bike specific shoes, but if you ride with any frequency, the performance benefits of shoes made for the purpose should not be overlooked. Whether you’re riding cross country, trail, enduro, or downhill, there are models designed to be optimal for each type of riding. Mountain bike shoes generally have more rigid soles to promote more efficient power transfer when pedaling and prevent foot fatigue when descending. Grippy outsoles provide traction on the pedals and when off the bike walking on varied terrain. Protective features like padding and reinforced areas are integrated into many designs to ward off rock strikes to the toes and heels. And, of course, shoes designed to be used with clipless pedals have a cleat mount area for the cleat that is necessary for clipping into the pedal. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Clipless vs. flat pedals, which is best?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There’s really no right answer to this question as it typically comes down to personal preference and the type of riding you’re doing. Each pedal style has pros and cons. Most riders choose one or the other, while some will switch back and forth to enjoy the benefits of both styles. Clipless pedals provide a mechanical connection to the pedal, keep your feet in the perfect spot, and help to maximize your pedaling effort through the full pedal stroke. For this reason, they are typically preferred by cross-country riders/racers and others who put in big miles and want to be as efficient as possible. The downsides are that they take some getting used to and awkward falls are not uncommon when learning, and you generally have less foot mobility and freedom of movement. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">Flat pedals</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-flat-pedal-shoes/\">flat pedal shoes</a> offer greater foot mobility with varying support and grip depending on the platform size, pin style/placement, and sole rubber/tread design. Flat pedals can be very grippy and secure, however, they do not provide a mechanical connection to the pedals, which results in a slight decrease in pedaling efficiency. It is also possible to bounce off the pedals in rough terrain or slip a foot off while climbing, which can be potentially very painful if/when the pedal pins make contact with your shins. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why Are They Called Clipless Pedals If You Clip In?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The term “clipless” is definitely confusing due to the fact that you actually clip in to clipless pedals. The term clipless goes back decades, to a time when most pedals had toe clips, or toe cages, that wrapped up over the toe of your shoes to help prevent your feet from slipping off the front of the pedal. When Shimano developed its original SPD pedal system, it did not have the toe clip, and thus the term clipless was born. These days, clipless pedals are often referred to as clip, clip-in, and SPD, which are less confusing. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Can I use mountain bike shoes for road or gravel riding?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Of course. While we generally recommend <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">road-specific shoes</a> for road cycling, there’s no reason that you can’t use mountain bike shoes for riding on the road or gravel bike. Generally speaking, cross-country style shoes will be the best fit for this as they tend to provide the best pedaling efficiency with stiffer soles and lighter weights. In theory, a shoe like the Shimano S-Phyre XC9 or the Specialized S-Works Recon could have you covered for XC, gravel, and road riding as long as you have the same pedals across all the bikes. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How Much Should I Spend?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>This really depends on your budget, but also your needs and wants from your shoes. Prices vary quite significantly between the least and most expensive models we tested, as does performance. If you’re seeking the highest in performance, particularly for cross-country riding and racing, then you’ll need to be willing and able to spend a bit more for high-end shoes to meet your performance expectations. Top-of-the-line cross-country shoes can cost upwards of $400, but often brands have several versions that cost less and offer similar features and performance. Shoes for trail and gravity riding tend to be less expensive than their cross-country counterparts, although the high-end models can still cost up to around $250. That said, they have a more approachable price range with models starting around $100-$125, and performance differences being less dramatic than their XC counterparts. At the lowest end of the price spectrum, below $100, several brands make entry-level shoes that will serve more casual riders very well. These models can’t compete with more expensive shoes, but they absolutely can get the job done and they will work much better than riding in your old jogging shoes.
