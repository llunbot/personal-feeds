And now we have the first official teaser trailer. Count several Ars staffers among the many fans of Jordan's books who have been eagerly following the years-long development of the series. From what we've seen, it looks like showrunner Rafe Judkins (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-takes-final-bow-with-high-octane-journey-through-time/\"><em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></a>) has gotten the overall look and feel of the books exactly right. Fans should be pleased.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/we-have-our-first-look-at-images-from-amazons-new-wheel-of-time-series/\">I've written previously</a>, the TV series will center on Moiraine (<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/06/rosamund-pike-the-wheel-of-time-tv-adaptation-amazon-1202634993/\">played by</a> Oscar-nominee Rosamund Pike), a member of a powerful, all-woman organization called the Aes Sedai. Magic, known as the One Power, is divided into male (<em>saidin</em>) and female (<em>saidar</em>) flavors. The latter is the province of the Aes Sedai. Long ago, a great evil called the Dark One caused the <em>saidin</em> to become tainted, such that most men who show an ability to channel that magic go mad. It's the job of the Aes Sedai to track down such men and strip them of their abilities—a process known as \"gentling\" that, unfortunately, is often anything but. There is also an ancient prophecy concerning the Dragon Reborn: the reincarnation of a person who will save or destroy humanity.</p>\n<p>Given the epic scope of the novels, it's no surprise that the TV series boasts a sprawling cast. In addition to Pike, Josha Stradowski stars as Rand al'Thor, while Marcus Rutherford plays apprentice blacksmith and dream-walker Perrin Aybara. Zoë Robins plays healer Nynaeve al'Meara, and Madeleine Madden plays Egwene al'Vere. Barney Harris plays series comic relief Matrim Cauthon. Hammed Animashaun has been cast as Loail, a close friend to Perrin and Rand al'Thor. Alexandre Willaume portrays Thom Merrilin, a \"gleeman and adventurer\"—basically a traveling bard—while Johann Myers plays the villainous Padan Fain, and Alvaro Morte plays Logain.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791615#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791615&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff73443e6da983054b34e256eecbc4037aa64e5cc20a6e9638937b7ce596e36d","category":"Tech"}
