In short, it said that Apple managed to make the Space Black finish's anodized surface \"more uneven\" at a microscopic level, resulting in more light reflecting off it for a darker appearance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Apple found they could etch the already rough anodized surface, making it more uneven,\" wrote iFixit's Kevin O'Reilly. \"The resulting nooks and crannies further diffuse incoming light rays, sending them off in even more directions. Less white light makes its way to our eyeballsâ€”resulting in that slick matte finish.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\niFixit provides an in-depth, scientific overview of the Space Black finish, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/\">new anodization seal that reduces fingerprints</a>, in its <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/86128/how-apple-made-the-space-black-macbook-pro-darker-than-ever\">blog post</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Pro models launched earlier this week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/\">Teardown</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/ifixit-m3-macbook-pro-teardown/\">iFixit Shares M3 MacBook Pro Teardown, Explains How Apple Created Space Black Finish</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-m3-macbook-pro-teardown-explains-how-apple-created-space-black-finish.2410617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d6d2c79368b6fbbf80c3ebef5beae5bdc3b03991a00bde62ddfeda6d3395c03d","category":"Apple"}
