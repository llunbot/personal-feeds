Nico was a pro rider from 2004 to 2021 and is a two-time <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> stage winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His long and successful career saw him have spells at Sky, AG2R and SaxoBank, among others. The Vuelta was Nico’s favourite race – he thrived in the heat – so we kick off by asking what makes that race so special, and does it get the respect it deserves? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Nico is a top cycling pundit and gravel racer, so the conversation really gets around the houses in expert fashion, from his assessment of Tadej Pogačar to team dynamics to the evolution of training. Then things get personal, as Nico discusses what it was like being a young pro with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-power-of-three-stephen-roche-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Roche</a> as your father.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thoroughly enjoyed this one; Nico was a wonderful guy to talk to and very generous with his time, so thanks Nico! And to you, dear listener, we hope you enjoy as much as we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 6min 52sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/113-nico-roche-pogacar-la-vuelta-son-of-stephen-roche\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 113 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know <em>Cyclist</em> is also stunning monthly magazine?
