Lower decks!\" The fifth season of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> will be the animated series' last (boo!). </p></div>\n<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> is a particular favorite among Ars staffers; it's arguably the best of the recent crop of Star Trek shows, along with <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>. So we were disappointed when we learned that the animated series would be ending with its fifth season. Paramount+ debuted the first teaser for S5 during the Star Trek panel at San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend, along with a teaser for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Section_31\"><em>Star Trek: Section 31</em></a>—a spinoff film from <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> featuring Michelle Yeoh's Philippa Georgiou—a clip from <em>Strange New Worlds</em> S3, and the latest news about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_television_series#Starfleet_Academy\"><em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The <em>Lower Decks</em> teaser opens with a suitably nostalgic recap of some of the highlights of the adventures of the plucky crew of the USS <em>Cerritos,</em> inviting viewers to join them for one last adventure. Cue Boimler (Jack Quaid) and Mariner (Tawny Newsome) in voiceover objecting to that description (\"Yeah, right, we're not done voyaging—we've hardly even cracked one quadrant yet\"). Their S5 mission involves a \"quantum fissure\" that is causing \"space potholes\" to pop up all over the Alpha Quadrant (\"boo interdimensional portals!\"), and the <em>Cerritos</em> crew must close them—while navigating angry Klingons, an Orion war, and who knows what other crazy developments?</p>\n<p>The final season of <em>Lower Decks</em> premieres on Paramount+ on October 24, 2024, and will run through December 19.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039676#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039676&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"48e38272f06d13a1bb958d49455a3d8bb3de0ec199df2098a5056c3e69c7231c","category":"Tech"}
