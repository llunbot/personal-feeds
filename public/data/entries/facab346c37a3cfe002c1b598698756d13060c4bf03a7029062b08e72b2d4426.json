We’ve got your back! <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/pdf/convinceyourboss-antwerp-2023.pdf\"><strong>Download the Convince Your Boss PDF</strong></a> to tip the scales in your favor. And we’ve prepared a “<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/antwerp-2023/convince-your-boss\">letter to the boss</a>” template for you as well. Good luck! 🤞🤞🏼🤞🏾</p>\n\nWhat Should You Expect?\n<p>SmashingConfs have always been about how we work, how we fail and how we succeed. We kindly encourage speakers to share <strong>lessons learned</strong> and show how they work. Don’t be surprised by speakers sitting down and showing their design process, or setting up a Figma board and <strong>designing live</strong> with the audience. <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM9OiDHOomVpPkZapmVTVNKOMoVJLDKHfyBe6Z8GU2lDFeGdwkUlYuiwChlMk3ftg?mc_cid=6e0174dcff&amp;mc_eid=c2259fc0cc&amp;key=VFFId3dtSDV2WHlrSHNkdl85OW8zRnBIS0dZdFBR\">Check what SmashingConfs are like</a> (+ <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/227793688\">video</a>).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/meet-smashingconf-antwerp/antwerpen-smashingconf-2023-bourla-theatre.png\" /></p>\n<p>Don’t expect big picture talks or abstract concepts — Smashing Conferences are always <strong>honest, practical and passionate</strong>. Speakers are also very approachable and there is enough time for you to ask all your questions and get all the answers, in 1:1-conversations or in round tables.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s also very <strong>friendly and inclusive</strong>. In fact, we know many attendees by names, and we love friendships emerging as people get together and learn together, during the talks and in the workshops. Plus, we design our side events to help everyone take part in meaningful, respectful conversations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Everybody is welcome</strong>. Not everyone has to speak, but everyone has to feel heard.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/meet-smashingconf-antwerp/antwerpen-2023-bourla-theatre-inside.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>We don’t choose <strong>venues</strong> randomly either. We love the contrast of beautiful historical venues and digital craftsmanship. So for Antwerp, we’ve chosen <a href=\"https://www.bourlaschouwburg.nu/node/75\">Bourla Schouwburg</a>, an unforgettable neoclassical theatre in the heart of Antwerp, <strong>meticulously designed and built in 1820s</strong> and decorated with statues of Apollo and the nine muses (to get your creativity flowing!). The <em>Bourla Theatre</em> will be your home for both conference days.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>we love a good mystery</strong>, and we love to have fun! This shows in plenty of side events, morning runs, mysterious riddles, design challenges and walking tours around the chocolate factory and waffle shops.</p>\n\nFor Designers and UI Engineers\n<p>We’ve designed the conference <strong>for UX designers, product designers and interface designers</strong>, but it will have plenty of insights for UI engineers and jacks of all trades as well. If you want to boost your design and UX skills, you’ll be in the right place: with insightful talks and <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/antwerp-2023/workshops\">practical workshops</a>.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/antwerp-2023/workshops\"><img src=\"https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0ab760f2-2c09-4e7f-be53-f18953a763a1/smashingconf-workshops.jpg\" /></a>All <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/antwerp-2023/workshops\">workshops</a> are hands-on and practical, so you can apply your new skills immediately.\n\n<p>We’ll dive into:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>design systems</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>design patterns</strong>,</li>\n<li>usability and UX research,</li>\n<li>product design and workflow,</li>\n<li>enterprise UX and complex UIs,</li>\n<li>inclusive design and accessibility,</li>\n<li><strong>new design techniques</strong> (in Figma, Miro etc.),</li>\n<li>sustainable and age-friendly design,</li>\n<li>UX writing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will announce the first talks and workshops shortly.
