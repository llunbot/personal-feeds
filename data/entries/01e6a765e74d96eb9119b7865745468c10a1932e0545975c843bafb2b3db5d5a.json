MacBook Air models with the M1 chip and M2 chip officially support only one external display, while MacBook Air models with the M3 chip gained support for two external displays, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/\">only with the lid closed</a>. With the new model, users can have a total of three screens, with the MacBook Air open next to two external displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/MacBook-Air-M4-External-Displays.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1958\" height=\"1120\" />\r<br />\nApple silicon MacBook Air models already worked with multiple external displays with the use of DisplayLink adapters, but many casual customers in the MacBook Air's target market might not have known about that option, so official plug-and-play support for two external displays with the lid open is a welcomed improvement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, released last year, also natively supports two external displays while the lid is open.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Air can be pre-ordered now, and it launches Wednesday, March 12.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/m4-macbook-air-two-displays-with-lid-open/\">Apple Has Finally Solved One of the MacBook Air's Biggest Limitations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-finally-solved-one-of-the-macbook-airs-biggest-limitations.2452075/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01e6a765e74d96eb9119b7865745468c10a1932e0545975c843bafb2b3db5d5a","category":"Apple"}
