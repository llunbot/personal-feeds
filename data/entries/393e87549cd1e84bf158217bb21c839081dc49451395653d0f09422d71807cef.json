The new, lower-priced version of YouTube's paid video subscription service functions largely without ads, though music videos on the platform continue to include them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/General-YouTube-Feature-Redux.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><blockquote>Today we'll begin expanding our Premium Lite pilot to users in the US. Premium Lite gives viewers a new, more affordable way to enjoy most videos on YouTube ad-free for $7.99 per month. In the coming weeks, we'll also make Premium Lite available to all users in our current pilot countries - Thailand, Germany, and Australia.</blockquote>According to the Google subsidiary, YouTube Premium Lite is aimed at people who want to consume podcasting, make-up, gaming streams, tutorials, and other core creator content on YouTube that is distinguishable from music.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's important to note that the new Premium Lite plan does not include the ability to download and background play YouTube videos on devices. For users who want ad-free music on YouTube and YouTube Music, plus offline and background play, YouTube continues to recommend its Premium plan ($13.99 per month).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Premium-Lite_final__en_YeuAq9t.width-1000.format-webp.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" />\r<br />\nYouTube said it will continue to expand its Premium Lite pilots to additional countries this year and introduce more ways for users to get the most from their subscriptions.
