It also signals the death of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/specialized-epic-hardtail-review/\">Epic Hardtail</a> above the Comp level because the brand feels the Epic World Cup provides for all the needs of its elite riders.</p>\n<p>The S-Works Epic World Cup is priced at £12,000/$12,000/€12,500, while the Pro build level is £8,500/$8,900/€9,000.</p>\n<p>Bikes are available to order now, with some retailers already receiving limited quantities.</p>\n<p>How does the new Specialized Epic World Cup? Read our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/specialized-s-works-epic-world-cup/\">first ride review</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A new Brain?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The brass button is used to set how much air pressure is in the negative air chamber.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The frame features a hardtail-like silhouette, similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2020-trek-supercaliber/\">Trek Supercaliber</a>, with the rear shock integrated into the top tube.</p>\n<p>Specialized has partnered with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rockshox-suspension-fork-guide/\">RockShock</a> to develop the SIDLuxe WCID (World Cup Integrated Design) rear shock.</p>\n<p>The new shock enables the bike to be set up in three distinct settings: No Gulp, Half Gulp and Full Gulp.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The three settings can’t be changed while riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>These settings refer to how much air is in the negative air chamber, which is controlled via a button valve on the shock’s body that leaks air from the positive chamber.</p>\n<p>The firm ‘No Gulp’ setting requires maximum force to initiate the suspension system because there is no air in the negative spring.</p>\n<p>The shock does not sag in this setting. Specialized says this means the system gives approximately the same <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">amount of travel</a> as a typical 100mm-travel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a> system set up with 25 per cent sag (a fairly standard setting for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country mountain bike</a>).</p>\n<p>The brand says this is best for smooth courses.</p>\n<p>The medium ‘Half Gulp’ setting has an increase in negative air pressure, which makes it easier to initiate travel, increasing small bump sensitivity for rougher trails.</p>\n<p>Finally, the active ‘Full Gulp’ setting has maximum negative air pressure and features a more linear progression with a flatter spring rate.</p>\n<p>Specialized has departed from the Brain suspension system, which uses an inertia valve to lock the rear shock while pedalling and opens it under impact.</p>\n<p>The Brain has controlled the Epic’s rear shock since 2002 and Specialized sees the new shock as an evolution of the same principles.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Brain lives on in the RockShox SID SL Ultimate.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-rockshox-sid-ultimate-fork-review/\">RockShox SID SL Ultimate</a> still features a Brain damper, incorporating Position-Sensitive technology that enables you to sag 15mm into the fork.</p>\n<p>Specialized says this provides small bump compliance and a firm pedalling platform without needing a remote lockout or lever flip.</p>\n<p>The Epic World Cup uses a small linkage shaped like a dog bone hidden under the top tube.</p>\n<p>Specialized says this size reduction increases stiffness because tolerances have been minimised compared to the larger linkage on the current Epic.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Epic World Cup geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Geometry has been slackened compared to the existing Epic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The new bike features a slacker geometry than the regular Epic, with the head angle one degree slacker at 66.5 degrees.</p>\n<p>The bike also features a more aggressive 74.5-degree seat angle, compared to 75.8 degrees.</p>\n<p>This is a common trend on cross-country bikes. As courses become more technical there are more seconds to make up on the downhill, making a more capable bike more competitive.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th></th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b> Stack </b> (mm)</td><td>600</td><td>600</td><td>614</td><td>628</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Reach </b> (mm)</td><td>415</td><td>440</td><td>465</td><td>490</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Head tube length </b> (mm)</td><td>93</td><td>95</td><td>110</td><td>125</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Head tube angle </b> (degrees)</td><td>66.5</td><td>66.5</td><td>66.5</td><td>66.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Bottom bracket height </b> (mm)</td><td>313</td><td>313</td><td>313</td><td>313</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Bottom bracket drop </b> (mm)</td><td>58</td><td>57</td><td>57</td><td>57</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Trail </b> (mm)</td><td>113</td><td>113</td><td>113</td><td>113</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Fork length </b> (mm)</td><td>516</td><td>516</td><td>516</td><td>516</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Fork offset </b> (mm)</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td><td>44</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Front center </b> (mm)</td><td>701</td><td>726</td><td>757</td><td>788</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Chainstay length </b> (mm)</td><td>430</td><td>430</td><td>430</td><td>430</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Wheelbase </b> (mm)</td><td>1,124</td><td>1,150</td><td>1,181</td><td>1,212</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Standover height </b> (mm)</td><td>761</td><td>764</td><td>774</td><td>786</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Seat tube length </b> (mm)</td><td>395</td><td>410</td><td>450</td><td>500</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Seat tube angle </b> (degrees)</td><td>74.5</td><td>74.5</td><td>74.5</td><td>74.5</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Specialized Epic World Cup frame details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s new Stealth brake levers enable the cables to run closer to the bar for a neater look.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The S-Works frameset is manufactured using Specialized’s premium FACT 12m high-modulus carbon fibre.
