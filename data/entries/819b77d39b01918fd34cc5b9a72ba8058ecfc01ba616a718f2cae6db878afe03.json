But a faulty sensor in the seat of some cars means it might deploy when it's not supposed to.

The problem has been traced to a change in the base material for the sensor's printed circuit boardâ€”Honda's tier 1 supplier made the change when a natural disaster disrupted production at the tier 2 supplier that normally provided the base material. The changed circuit board was not properly verified and \"could allow additional strain to the printed circuit board that can lead to a capacitor cracking and an internal short circuit.\"</p>\n<p>A warranty claim in August 2020 was Honda's first inkling that it had a problem. Initial investigations turned up little, but the automaker kept receiving warranty claims and in January 2024 decided to issue a recall. In total it says it has had 3,834 warranty claims for this issue between June 2020 and January 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001301#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001301&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
