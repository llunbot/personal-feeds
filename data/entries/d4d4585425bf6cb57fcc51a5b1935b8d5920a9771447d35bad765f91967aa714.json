The decommissioning, <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/149826/openai-quietly-shutters-its-ai-detection-tool\">first noticed</a> by Decrypt, occurred with no major fanfare and was announced through a small note added to OpenAI's official <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text\">AI Classifier webpage</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As of July 20, 2023, the AI classifier is no longer available due to its low rate of accuracy. We are working to incorporate feedback and are currently researching more effective provenance techniques for text, and have made a commitment to develop and deploy mechanisms that enable users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Released on January 31 amid <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-writing-college-student-essays/672371/\">clamor</a> from educators about students potentially using ChatGPT to write essays and schoolwork, OpenAI's AI Classifier always felt like a performative Band-Aid on a deep wound. From the beginning, OpenAI admitted that its AI Classifier was not \"fully reliable,\" correctly identifying only 26 percent of AI-written text as \"likely AI-written\" and incorrectly labeling human-written works 9 percent of the time.</p>\n\n<p>As we've pointed out on Ars, AI writing detectors such as OpenAI's AI Classifier, Turnitin, and GPTZero <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/\">simply don't work</a> with enough accuracy to rely on them for trustworthy results. The methodology behind how they work is speculative and unproven, and the tools are currently routinely used to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/\">falsely accuse</a> students of cheating.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956764#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956764&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d4d4585425bf6cb57fcc51a5b1935b8d5920a9771447d35bad765f91967aa714","category":"Tech"}
