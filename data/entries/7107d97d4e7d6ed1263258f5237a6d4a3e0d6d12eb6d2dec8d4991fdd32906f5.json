{"title":"DCR Winter Open House 2024 Photo Recap!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/12/dcr-open-house-winter-house-photo.html","date":1734364799000,"content":"<p>It was time for the last <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/change-coming-moving.html\">DC Rainmaker Open House in Amsterdam</a>, and the event certainly didn’t disappoint! It was the largest one to date, squeaking in everyone we could within the roughly 200-person limit we have for the DCR Cave. People came from near and far, with both a strong Dutch crowd locally, but also the most we’ve ever had fly across from the US (and elsewhere) to join us.</p>\n<p>As always, the day is divided up into basically two parts. First, in the morning there’s the group run, where we run around Amsterdam for about 8-10KM hitting up some of the sights. As a rule of thumb, the weather on that weekend somehow always ends up being the worst it’s been since last winter. The run starts from All4Running, a nearby running shop. Then, later in the evening, is the main Open House event itself, which of course occurs at the DCR Open House.</p>\n<p>As always, the event is free, and there’s beer, wine, food, and plenty of giveaways.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, thanks to our partners this year for helping support the Open House with giveaways, including:</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://all4running.nl/\">All4Running</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://assmagic.com/\">Ass Magic</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://www.ciovita.com/collections/dc-rainmaker\">Ciovita</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/\">Canyon</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://visit.pfandh.com/dcr\">Precision Fuel &amp; Hydration</a></p>\n<p>Canyon is new this winter, but the others have been supporting the site and Open House for years in some cases!</p>\n<h3><strong>The Morning Run:</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5662.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5662.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5662.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5662-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5662-720x540.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>So, in true DCR Open House Fashion, it was just about at the freezing level and on-and-off-again raining prior to the start of the morning run. That said, somehow, for the entire run, it didn’t actually rain. Fear not, it made up for it a few hours later.</p>\n<p>As always, we met at <a href=\"https://all4running.nl/\">All4Running</a>, near Vondelpark for the run. This basically gives us more time back at the DCR Cave during the day to make it presentable. The All4Running crew is awesome, as always.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5613.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5613.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5613-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5613-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5613-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5613-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Paul was there in his banana suit. If you’re not familiar with Paul, he does awesome work by picking up a bag of trash on every run (called Plogging), more on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wayeoflife/?hl=en\">his Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@WayeOfLife\">YouTube channel</a> about his efforts.</p>\n<p>We grab a quick group photo before heading out into the beautiful Dutch weather.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5620.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5620-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5620-1.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5620-1-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5620-1-720x540.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>The general goal is to stay as one group, at least for the majority of the run. This isn’t (usually) a race. First up was Vondelpark:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5625.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5625.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5625.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5625-200x150.jpg 200w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5631.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5631.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5631.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5631-200x150.jpg 200w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5637.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5637.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5637-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5637-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5637-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5637-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>From there, we’d swing over to the Rijksmuseum, or rather, through the Rijksmuseum. Somehow running (or riding) through a building never gets old.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5643.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5643-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5643-1.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5643-1-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5643-1-720x540.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Then, of course, the group photo. The first time ever there were no tourists around to take our photo. Someone has always been nearby and offered, but the weather must have kept most of the (smart ones) in bed. Thus, a group selfie will do instead!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5648.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5648.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5648.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5648-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5648-720x540.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>From there we crossed town again, towards Olympic Stadium, and most notably, the community running track next door. A rarity globally, this pristine track has no fences around it, and is totally open to runners 24×7 (and the community at large). It’s where I did all my track-related training and testing in Amsterdam, including this <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/01/running-measurements-rabbit.html\">silly post about measuring tracks</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5653.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5653.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5653.jpg 1438w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5653-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5653-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5653-300x200.jpg 300w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5653-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w\" /></p>\n<p>And yes, that’s my favorite statue in the corner there. If you’re not familiar with the statue, it’ll definitely give you a double-take from a distance, especially on a rainy/foggy day.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5655.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5655.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5655-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5655-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5655-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5655-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>After that we rounded a few more canals, working our way back (and trying to clock in precisely 10KM).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5657.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5657.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5657.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5657-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5657-720x540.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Time for one final group picture, photo-bombed by a cyclist on the path:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5658.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5658.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5658.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5658-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5658-720x540.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, after everyone left, both myself and Bobbie (The Girl) may have gotten distracted buying new running shoes. I mean, when in Rome, and all that…. A new pair of Hoka’s for me, and New Balance for her.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5670.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5670.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5670.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5670-200x266.jpg 200w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5667.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5667.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5667.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5667-200x266.jpg 200w\" /></p>\n<p>After that, it was back to the DCR Cave for clean-up, including sending Bobbie up to jump around in the cardboard dumpster making more room:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5675.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5675.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5675.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5675-200x158.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5675-720x570.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>Gotta do what ya gotta do…</p>\n<h3><strong>The Open House:</strong></h3>\n<p>It was a properly miserable weather night. Pretty much as bad as you get without turning to snow. Heavy sideways rains as part of a storm system that wasn’t quite powerful enough to trigger the Dutch Headwind Cycling Championships that weekend, but almost did. Thus properly sucky weather.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we do what any good friend does, and stick some of our best friends outside in jackets at the door to check people in (where they get their raffle tickets):</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1474.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1474.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1474-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1474-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1474-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1474-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>I mean, we did have a roof sorta over them, and gave them the crappiest of space heaters. Thanks, Tom &amp; Kristen, for braving the elements!</p>\n<p>Directly inside to the left was Ciovita, setup with all the <a href=\"https://www.ciovita.com/collections/dc-rainmaker\">latest DC Rainmaker Gear</a> – including running t-shirts, socks, cycling jerseys, and more. Plus, on the way out, you got a free pair of Ciovita socks. Woot!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1455.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1455.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1455-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1455-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1455-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1455-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Downstairs at the DCR Cave is basically just a big open space where we can host parties, or throw extra gear. It’s the garage space you wish you had, but also kinda didn’t wish you had, because it allows you to never really properly declutter. However, each year, the day before the open house, I attempt to make it presentable again:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1559.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1559.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1559-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1559-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1559-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1559-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>To the left side, we’ve got the Heat Chamber, the stage to the right, and the bar below us. Plus, all the food to the left too. Speaking of which, Julio was back in action carving up the Spanish ham:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1477.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1477.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1477.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1477-200x175.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1477-720x631.jpg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>While back at the bar, Bobbie &amp; Birgit were serving up Pete’s beer. He made the custom microbrew for our event, as he did this past summer. See, it’s a good thing to have beer-making friends from <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/brouwerij_beetje\">Brouwerij Beetje</a>!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_2923.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2923.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2923.jpeg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2923-200x150.jpeg 200w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"9efc6597-c25a-4b75-8b85-fa857f9e73ee.JPG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/9efc6597-c25a-4b75-8b85-fa857f9e73ee.jpg\" alt=\"9efc6597 c25a 4b75 8b85 fa857f9e73ee.\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/9efc6597-c25a-4b75-8b85-fa857f9e73ee.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/9efc6597-c25a-4b75-8b85-fa857f9e73ee-200x150.jpg 200w\" /></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, upstairs is where all the tech is, including the main studio, gear closet, and hall of bikes. I had lined up the bulk of the current-gen smart bikes so people could compare them side-by-side. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.muov.bike/\">Muov Bikes was there</a> as well, with two of their bikes that can basically sway or flex as you ride.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1503.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1503.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1503.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1503-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1503-300x200.jpg 300w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1527.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1527.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1527.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1527-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1527-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>And then off to the left there was a Zwift Ride, KICKR Bike Shift, and KICKR Bike V2. Sorta the non-swaying good/better/best type arrangement, incrementing the cost roughly $1,200+ each step. Also, more importantly – people just hang out and enjoying chatting!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1545.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1545.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1545-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1545-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1545-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1545-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Both myself and Bobbie were wandering around catching up with everyone – including, such as below, not one, but two different Olympians in one frame with me (both rowers): <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nsprang/?hl=en\">Niki van Sprang</a> at right, and center is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jasonosbornerowing/?hl=en\">Jason Osborne</a>, who most recently won the UCI e-sport world title.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1516.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1516.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1516.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1516-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1516-300x200.jpg 300w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_5723.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5723.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5723.jpg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5723-200x134.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_5723-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Albeit, perhaps the real Olympian is Aleksandra above, as she gets the pleasure of handling all of our unexpected incoming Amsterdam packages these days. From smart bikes to watches, she’s our BFF we call when FedEx is ringing our Nest Cam doorbell and we’re 1,500km away.</p>\n<p>Oh, remember that food? Upstairs it was cut on this table, by this team of vegetable swordsmen. Thanks guys!!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_2858.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2858.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2858.jpeg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2858-200x150.jpeg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2858-720x540.jpeg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>However, back in the studio, plenty of folks took photos at the main desk where I shoot most of my YouTube videos:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_2898.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2898.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2898.jpeg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2898-200x150.jpeg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_2898-720x540.jpeg 720w\" /></p>\n<p>There were numerous companies there, as always. I thought this small single-person startup (<a href=\"https://app.trainingsparkle.com/\">TrainingSparkle</a>) is pretty cool. Basically it pulls in your Strava or Garmin Connect activities, including your photos, and makes a printable book out of it. Super cool. I’ll buy one in the new year with all my 2024 activities, and do a ‘review’ of it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1523.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1523.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1523-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1523-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1523-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1523-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Soon though, it was time for the Q&amp;A session and giveaways. This is basically where we have a bunch of things to give away, while concurrently just answering whatever questions people have – tech or non-tech. It’s usually quite a bit of fun, with a solid variety of questions for both myself and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@DesFit\">Des of DesFit</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1567.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1567.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1567-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1567-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1567-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1567-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>I even have this recorded somewhere, which I may remember to publish eventually.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1580.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1580.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1580-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1580-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1580-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/12/IMG_1580-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, we had plenty of great giveaways to hand out, via the raffle tickets.

We’re tentatively targeting an early October timeframe for such an event. We heard from many of you at the open house that said they’d love something in that timeframe as the airfare/hotel is cheaper, and running/riding/swimming is still amazing in Mallorca (let’s be honest, it’s amazing today in mid-December, being 18°C/65°F and sunny).</p>\n<p>And don’t worry, we’ll be sure to give many-many months’ notice for that. Now, we just gotta get a new cave location finalized.
