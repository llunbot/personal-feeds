Using electronic health records, researchers had follow-up data for up to 15 years after the patients started taking either a GLP-1 drug, insulin, or metformin between 2008 and 2015.</p>\n<p>This type of study can't prove that the GLP-1 drugs caused the lower associated risks, but the results fit with some earlier findings. That includes results from one trial that found a 32 percent overall lower risk of obesity-associated cancers following bariatric surgery for weight loss.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035856#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035856&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c19de133d7027f73e1a169a7ed1d155cc7b61b865d2d854178c60321228c4e15","category":"Tech"}
