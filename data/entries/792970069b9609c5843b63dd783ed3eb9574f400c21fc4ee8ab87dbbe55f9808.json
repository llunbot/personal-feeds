The crew assignment comes six years after NASA pulled Epps from what would have been her first spaceflight, just months before her scheduled launch to the space station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/01/nasa-has-pulled-jeanette-epps-just-months-before-her-first-flight/\">removal of Epps from the Soyuz mission in 2018</a> raised a lot of questions. It's not the first time NASA has pulled an astronaut off of space missions soon before launch, but it's usually for medical reasons, like an illness or an injury.</p>\n<p>That wasn't the case for Epps, who was replaced by a backup crew member on the Soyuz flight in 2018. NASA never publicly stated a reason for the crew change. Some people outside the agency theorized Epps might have been removed from her flight for political or racial reasons—she would have become the first Black astronaut to fly a long-duration stint on the space station—but Ars has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/after-being-pulled-from-a-spaceflight-in-january-jeanette-epps-speaks-up/\">reported that did not appear to be the case</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959038#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959038&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"792970069b9609c5843b63dd783ed3eb9574f400c21fc4ee8ab87dbbe55f9808","category":"Tech"}
