Does this mean that there will be no spring event in 2025? We investigate below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we explain what you need to know about Apple’s spring event, including whether Apple will hold a spring event in 2025, and, if it does, when it might be held, how to watch it, and what products you can expect to be unveiled.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will Apple hold a spring event in 2025?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past ten years Apple has held seven spring events, with the exception of 2023, 2020 and 2017 (and there would undoubtedly have been one in 2020 if it wasn’t for the pandemic).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s spring event is one of the three or four big events in Apple’s yearly cycle of announcements. There’s the big iPhone/Mac software announcements at WWDC in the summer, the iPhone launch in September, sometimes we see Apple make Mac and iPad announcements in October or November, and (most years) we get some hardware reveals at a spring event in March or April. At these events Apple executives hit the stage–whether real or virtual–and boast about some recent successes, before revealing what new products are about to launch. For more detail on Apple’s calendar of events, read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">When is the next Apple event?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But will there be an event in spring 2025? It is unlikely. Apple has indicated that a new product will launch on Wednesday February 19, but this will be a product launch via a press release to the media, and not an event. This is the same approach that Apple used in October 2024 when it issued press releases regarding M4 series of MacBooks, iMac, and Mac mini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These Mac announcements could certainly have been made at an event if Apple had wished: the new M4 Pro and M4 Max were worthy of attention, as was the new design of the Mac mini. But Apple settled on press releases spread over a few days. This could be the start of a trend to avoid the immediacy of an event, where smaller news gets dwarfed by the big stories, in favor of a more controlled, staggered release. Is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2605372/the-era-of-the-apple-event-is-over.html\">the era of the Apple event is over</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will Apple launch in February 2025?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">new iPhone SE</a> (or iPhone 16E) is expected to launch on February 19, bringing <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> and a brand news design to the entry-level iPhone. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2561596/where-is-apple-intelligence-on-my-iphone.html\">how to get Apple Intelligence on your iPhone</a> if you have a compatible model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may also launch the long overdue update to the standard iPad. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a> needs an update to enable support for Apple Intelligence. There are also rumors that Apple may soon issue an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2595313/ipad-air-2025-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">update to the iPad Air</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we are also awaiting a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air with M4 chip</a>, it’s not thought that Apple will launch it in February. That launch could happen later in the spring. The MacBook Air probably won’t be launched at an event, unless Apple surprises us with a Mac update that also includes the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, but those product launches are expected at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC in June</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is the Spring Apple event 2025?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is increasingly unlikely that there will be a Spring Apple Event in 2025, but, if Apple surprised us all when could such an event happen? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can make some educated guesses based on when the event has been held in the past, and other events happening around that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s typical for Apple to hold events (other than WWDC) on a Tuesday or a Wednesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple holds the event on March 11, 18 or 25 it could be selling the new products before its second quarter ends on March 30. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, If Apple waits until April we wouldn’t expect the event to fall too close to the Easter time frame, so April 8 or April 29 would be the most likely dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple previously held a Spring event on the following dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2024: Tuesday May 7: (“Let Loose”): 11 &amp; 14-inch iPad Pro M4, 11 &amp; 14-inch iPad Air M2, Apple Pencil Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023: no event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022, Tuesday March 8: (“Peek Performance,” virtual): New iPhone SE, new iPad Air, Mac Studio and Studio Display, and new iPhone color options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021, Tuesday April 20: (“Spring Loaded,” virtual): New iPad Pro and iMac, Apple TV 4K, AirTags, new iPhone color options and iOS 14.7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: no event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019, Monday March 25: (“It’s show time”): Apple Card, and the News+, TV+, and Arcade subscription services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018, Tuesday March 27: (“Let’s take a field trip”): New iPad and education announcements</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: no event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016, Monday March 21: (“Let us loop you in”): iPad Pro, iPhone SE, and software updates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015, Monday March 9: (“Spring Forward”): Apple Watch, a new MacBook, and iOS 8.2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: no event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: no event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012, Wednesday March 7: (“We have something you really have to see.

Rumor has it that this will be known as the iPhone 16 SE. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>11th-gen iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th-gen iPad launched back in October 2022 and is the only model that doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, so an update to the same A17 Pro chip as the iPad mini seems likely. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New iPad Air</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s already running on an M2 chip, which is more than capable of running Apple Intelligence, but apparently Apple is going to update the iPad Air. If it does the M3 chip is expected to appear in that device, which is a surprise because apparently the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2578508/m4-macbook-air-m3-chip-production-cost-yield-imac-mac-studio.html\">M3 has been quite a challenge</a> for Apple. Read about the <a href=\"http://Read%20https://www.macworld.com/article/2595313/ipad-air-2025-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html.\">2025 iPad Air</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 MacBook Air</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac mini already have M4 chips so it’s time that the MacBook Air got upgraded to the M4. More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air M4 rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other new products</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We could also see some updates to the Home products. There have been rumors of a faster version of the Apple TV, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen</a>, or a product that combines the two products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll probably be waiting until WWDC in June for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">Mac Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">Mac Studio M4 updates</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the spring event tagline and what does it mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple announces the tagline for a spring event there is usually a lot of speculation as to what it might indicate about the product announcements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the May 2024 event the tagline was Let Loose, a phrase that suggested freedom and the idea that creativity will be let loose. The image accompanying the invite was of an Apple Pencil drawing. So when a new range of iPads and a new Apple Pencil were launched it was no real surprise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The February 19 product launch was announced with a tweet from Tim Cook that many said reminded them of an AirTag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch Apple’s spring event live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to watch an Apple event – if there is one – would be to get an invite to attend in person, but most of us won’t be so lucky. Fortunately, Apple will also live stream the presentation so everyone can watch along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first place to try is right at the top of this article where we will have embedded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Apple\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s YouTube</a> stream. You can also watch on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s events page</a>, which will have the live stream on the night. Indeed, the main <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple.com</a> home page usually shows the presentation while it is happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve got an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple TV, or a Mac–assuming the device has sufficiently up-to-date software–you can watch the stream on the TV app. PC owners can also watch, but will need to visit Apple’s site as mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the event is finished, it will also be available to rewatch in the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/channel/apple-events/id6442627105\">Podcasts</a> and TV apps, and on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-events/\">Apple’s website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Apple has for certain events in the past held broadcast events in Apple Stores, so it may be worth contacting your nearest outlet to see if they have anything planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information about watching the event here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">How to watch Apple’s event.</a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"John Ternus in Apple's January 2023 M2 Mac launch video\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1921w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-Ternus-Apple-virtual-event-Jan-2023.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What has Apple launched in past spring events?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what Apple has announced at previous spring events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2024: Tuesday May 7: New iPad Air (M2) and iPad Pro (M4) models.

Expect some tedious bragging at the beginning; this may cover such topics as operating system adoption rates, hardware customer reviews, and eco-friendly manufacturing policies. But Apple wouldn’t hold an event if there wasn’t something worth hearing, and we should get into proper announcements within 10 minutes or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, you can expect multiple separate announcements at an Apple event.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6bd5578366fb7634513c3fcbd7c09c3e69d5462bc1fd945b739410fcf9aa8ab9","category":"Apple"}
