{"title":"Nick Heer on the MacOS 14 Sonoma Typography Palette","link":"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/typography-palette-sonoma/","date":1710788116000,"content":"\n<p>Nick Heer, Pixel Envy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For a long time, this palette was a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-to-use-the-font-panel-in-os-x/\">dry list</a> of checkboxes \nand disclosure triangles. A user would need to first know this \npalette exists, and then know what each option did. But, in a \nrecent version of MacOS, the palette has been <a href=\"https://c.im/@nickheer/112111864231807304\">updated with \nicons</a> that more clearly display what will change. \n<a href=\"https://c.im/@nickheer/112111905663674874\">Depending on the font file</a> in question, there are many \ndifferent options available, and the numerically differentiated \n“stylistic sets” have never been clear. This is much nicer. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is indeed a nice update to a little-known but wonderful standard feature in Cocoa’s text system. Who says AppKit is dead?</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/112113137851816118\">One gripe I have</a> is that the small caps options are no longer labelled “small caps” — you just sort of have to know what they are from the glyphs alone. And, oddly, on my Mac, for many but not all fonts, instead of seeing “A → <small>A</small>” to indicate small caps, I see a dollar sign: “$ → <small>$</small>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/18/heer-typography-palette\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1210939c01f85933216f18e9efe3440bc0e1c893d19a1d3e417d41cc7359c6fa","category":"Tech"}
