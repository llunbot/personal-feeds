A build number ending with an earlier letter in the alphabet typically indicates that beta testing is closer to completion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nmacOS Mojave was released in September back in 2018. The seventh beta of that update also had a build number ending in \"a.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nmacOS release dates since 2016:<ul><li><strong>macOS Sierra:</strong> September 20, 2016</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>macOS High Sierra:</strong> September 25, 2017</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>macOS Mojave:</strong> September 24, 2018</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>macOS Catalina:</strong> October 7, 2019</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>macOS Big Sur:</strong> November 12, 2020</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>macOS Monterey:</strong> October 25, 2021</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>macOS Ventura:</strong> October 24, 2022</li></ul>Other updates expected to be released in September include iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, tvOS 17, and HomePod software version 17.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no guarantee that Apple's past plans hint at the company's future plans, of course, so keep in mind that this is merely speculation. macOS Ventura had eleven beta versions and a Release Candidate before it was publicly released, while macOS Sonoma is only up to seven beta versions so far, so an October release cannot be ruled out. It is simply looking more likely that a September release could be in the cards in this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/macos-sonoma-release-timing/\">Will macOS Sonoma Be Released in September This Year?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-macos-sonoma-be-released-in-september-this-year.2400615/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4cf374c9c6ed535df8d382549b9e314dc181ffd9fa7a54782ecd940c325bed0f","category":"Apple"}
