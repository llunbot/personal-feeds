The good news: Adding a disinfectant to the toilet bowl before flushing and using disinfectant dispensers in the tank significantly reduce cross-contamination.</p>\n<p>Regarding toilet plumes, we're not just talking about large water droplets that splatter when a toilet is flushed. Even smaller droplets can form and be spread into the surrounding air, potentially carrying bacteria like <em>E. coli</em> or a virus (e.g., norovirus) if an infected person has previously used said toilet. Pathogens can linger in the bowl even after repeated flushes, just waiting for their chance to launch into the air and spread disease. That's because larger droplets, in particular, can settle on surfaces before they dry, while smaller ones travel further on natural air currents.</p>\n<p>The first experiments examining whether toilet plumes contained contaminated particles were done in the 1950s, and the notion that disease could be spread this way was popularized in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC187159/#:~:text=Droplets%20produced%20by%20flushing%20toilets,on%20surface%20throughout%20the%20bathroom.\">a 1975 study</a>. In 2022, physicists and engineers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, managed <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24686-5\">to visualize</a> toilet plumes of tiny airborne particles ejected from toilets during a flush using a combination of green lasers and cameras. It made for some pretty vivid video footage:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000168#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000168&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0cbcbb60fcd8b0464bcdafb74b245aa9bccf395192f7e0abf9b10603579f32f0","category":"Tech"}
