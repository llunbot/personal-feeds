The watches' designs have been updated moderately, as have their innards, and they will be the first smartwatches running Google and Samsung's new Wear OS.</p>\n<p>For the first time—and perhaps as a result of the Google/Samsung collaboration—the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch4/\" target=\"_blank\">new Galaxy Watch 4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch4-classic/\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> will not be able to pair with iOS devices.
