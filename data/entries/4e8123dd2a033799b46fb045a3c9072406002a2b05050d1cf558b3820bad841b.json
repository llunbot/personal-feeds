It was later spotted with F1 driver <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/unreleased-beats-pill-daniel-ricciardo/\">Daniel Ricciardo</a>, soccer star Lionel Messi, and Kim Kardashian.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>6/25. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@KingJames</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilTunechi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LilTunechi</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NkpLlTeVhJ\">pic.twitter.com/NkpLlTeVhJ</a></p>â€” Beats by Dre (@beatsbydre) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1802824048474562753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nOur first real look at the speaker came in May with images <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-beats-pill-ios-17-5/\">hidden in the iOS 17.5 beta</a>, and since then, it has been spotted in multiple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/new-beats-pill-speaker-on-apple-regulatory-website/\">regulatory databases</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile no official details have surfaced on the Beats Pill feature set, it has a pill-shaped design that's similar to the Beats Pill speaker that was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/\">discontinued in 2022</a>. The new model includes a lanyard that was not provided with prior speakers, and based on the iOS 17.5 leak, we know it will come in gold, red, and black. Other likely features include upgraded Bluetooth 5.3, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> integration, and USB-C charging, all of which are upgrades Apple has been adding across its product lineup.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-teases-june-25-beats-pill-unveiling/\">Apple Teases June 25 Beats Pill Unveiling</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-teases-june-25-beats-pill-unveiling.2429465/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e8123dd2a033799b46fb045a3c9072406002a2b05050d1cf558b3820bad841b","category":"Apple"}
