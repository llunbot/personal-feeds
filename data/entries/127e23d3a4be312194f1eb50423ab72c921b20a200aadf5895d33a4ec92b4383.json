In the future, ChatGPT Pro will gain \"more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe OpenAI o1 pro mode takes significantly more compute power to solve complex problems, which is why OpenAI is charging such a high fee. OpenAI says that o1 thinks longer for the \"most reliable responses,\" performing better on ML benchmarks across math, science, and coding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to OpenAI, ChatGPT Pro is aimed at researchers, engineers, and other individuals who use research-grade intelligence on a daily basis.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/openai-launches-200-month-chatgpt-pro-plan/\">OpenAI Launches $200/Month ChatGPT Pro Plan</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-launches-200-month-chatgpt-pro-plan.2444730/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"127e23d3a4be312194f1eb50423ab72c921b20a200aadf5895d33a4ec92b4383","category":"Apple"}
