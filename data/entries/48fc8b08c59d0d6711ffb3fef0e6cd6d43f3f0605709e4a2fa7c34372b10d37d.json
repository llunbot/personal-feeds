This means you won’t be able to pair a Shimano 12-speed mountain bike cassette with the system.</p>\n<p>Of course, some Shimano 12-speed road cassettes are 11-34 and 11-36 (the only options on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-105-di2-r7100-groupset/\">Shimano 105 Di2</a>). Ratio Technology doesn’t officially endorse pairing its kit with these cassettes because “the B-gap can be slightly affected”.</p>\n<p>The brand says it also tested SRAM’s MTB Exact-Actuation 10-speed derailleurs with the 11-36 cassettes and found that “some derailleurs don’t quite have the sufficient range of movement to shift properly across the width of the Shimano cassettes”.</p>\n<h2>Why might riders want to upgrade?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Scott Solace Gravel eRide 10 against a wall\" title=\"Scott Solace Gravel eRide 10 against a wall\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM doesn’t appear to have plans to launch 12-speed mechanical variants of its Rival, Force or Red groupsets.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM’s 11-speed road and gravel bike groupsets represent the last of the brand’s offerings in a mechanical variant.</p>\n<p>With the exception of the recently announced <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/gravel-groupset/sram-apex-eagle-review/\">Apex Eagle</a> (which utilises a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mullet-drivetrain/\">mullet drivetrain</a>), SRAM’s road and gravel 12-speed options are all <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"XDR freehub body on wheel in workshop\" title=\"XDR freehub body on wheel in workshop\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The XDR freehub body is typically required due to SRAM’s use of a smaller 10t starting cog.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>By enabling previous-generation SRAM 11-speed mechanical groupsets to work with 12-speed cassettes, this effectively offers riders an up-to-date mechanical option without the hassle of sourcing a wheelset that’s compatible with the brand’s XDR freehub.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"48fc8b08c59d0d6711ffb3fef0e6cd6d43f3f0605709e4a2fa7c34372b10d37d","category":"Cycling"}
