It is one of the most versatile dropper levers on the market, with most stock and aftermarket remotes – with the exception of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sdg-components-push-out-adjustable-tellis-lever-for-dropper-seat-posts-available-in-oil-slick/\" target=\"_blank\">SDG Tellis</a> and PNW Loam – offering little to nothing in the way of fine tuning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is available in black or silver with color accent options of black, silver, purple, red, blue, or orange. Like most high-end components, this one isn’t cheap; get it from Hope dealers now for £60.00 // €75.00 // $75.00 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"hope dropper lever silver reach lever adjust large bearing smooth action\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-silver-bearing-lever-length-adjust-reach.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Two positions are offered for lateral placement of the lever </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hope Tech Dropper Lever</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hope Dropper Lever, like all of the brand’s cnc-machined componentry, is produced in-house at their facility in Old Barnoldswick. With aesthetics to complement the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-tech-4-brake-levers-and-master-cylinder-deliver-30-more-braking-power/\" target=\"_blank\">Tech 4 brakes</a>, the lever pivots about a relatively large bearing, said to produce a smooth and precise feel to actuation. It is designed to work with any cable-actuated dropper seat post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reach adjustment is taken care of by a pin that dictates the starting point of the lever throw. Repositioning of the pin impacts cable tension, so the tension needs to be adjusted via the barrel adjuster in conjunction with this to perfect the setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"hope dropper lever rear view reach adjustment pin paddle positions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-cable-actuated-reach-leverage-adjust.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Reach and lever length can be easily adjusted to dial in fit</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the dropper lever’s leverage can be easily adjusted. The paddle itself can be mounted through a range of positions to make it effectively longer or shorter. In the longer position, the lever throw will be longer, but the actuation lighter. Alternatively, in the shorter position, throw will be reduced but actuation will require more force. The two extremes change actuation force by 20%.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-orange.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hope-dropper-lever-red.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lever can bolt to Hope<em> </em>brake levers via a direct shifter mount, and is also compatible with the SRAM Shifter style interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Hope Technology components are covered for two years against manufacturer defects in material and workmanship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hopetech.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-dropper-lever-reach-leverage-adjust/\">Hope Dropper Lever Offers Reach &amp; Leverage Adjustment</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"18563b6f893ae1187695301896038e54d5606c0bd456a023989d5027672ac217","category":"Cycling"}
