Since the beginning of 2024, BOE has only managed to deliver approximately 7-8 million panels to Apple, falling drastically short of its roughly 40 million unit orders.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe quality issues are expected to take at least six weeks to resolve. Meanwhile, industry insiders suggest that Samsung Display is likely to receive the majority of any redirected orders, since LG Display's production capacity is primarily focused on manufacturing LTPO AMOLED displays for iPhone \"Pro\" models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is just the latest setback in BOE's troubled history with iPhone OLED production.
