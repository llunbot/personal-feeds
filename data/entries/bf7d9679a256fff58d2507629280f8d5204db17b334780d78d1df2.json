When asked if \"it's realistic to shift to 100 percent electric vehicle production to meet the different regional targets from 2030 to 2040,\" only 11 percent said, \"Yes, definitely\"; fewer than 10 percent of European respondents believed the targets were realistic, compared with 12 percent in North America and 17 percent in Asia.</p>\n<p>Another 28 percent said, \"Yes, but it won't be easy.\" That left more than half of survey respondents believing that 2030–2040 is too soon for a move to entirely electric fleets. Forty-one percent said, \"Possibly, but not by the target dates,\" leaving just 18 percent who could never see the end of the internal combustion engine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922861#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922861&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
