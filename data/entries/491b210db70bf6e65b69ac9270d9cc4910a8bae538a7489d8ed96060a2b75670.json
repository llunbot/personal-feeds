To mark this special occasion, we have issued a limited-edition head badge on each one of our bikes we build during this big year. Our talented staff of 27 make it their daily focus to produce the best riding, most relevant handcrafted bikes possible. We build models for most cycling disciplines; gravel, road, mountain and cyclocross.<span> </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0097-copy-scaled.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://moots.com/moots-to-host-pre-ride-and-happy-hours-at-rad-dirt-fest-presented-by-wahoo/\">MOOTS TO HOST PRE-RIDE AND HAPPY HOURS at RAD DIRT FEST presented by WAHOO</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots</a>.</p>","author":"Jon Cariveau","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"491b210db70bf6e65b69ac9270d9cc4910a8bae538a7489d8ed96060a2b75670","category":"Cycling"}
