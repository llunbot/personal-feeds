However, each year it gets bigger and bigger in the UK as retailers compete to out-do each other.</p>\n<p>What historically was, as the name suggests, a day-long sale now runs for a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>What shouldn’t be ignored is the fact that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, online shopping is currently booming as shoppers avoid the high street. We can only assume that many retailers may opt to put a lot of their offers exclusively online.</p>\n<h2>Are the GoPro deals on Black Friday worth waiting for?</h2>\n<p>In 2020, we saw an excellent series of reductions across the GoPro line from a wide range of retailers, with savings of as much as £100 on Hero 8 bundles. Following the release of the Hero 9 and Hero 10, it’s fair to anticipate substantial discounts on the Hero 8 and older models.</p>\n<p>However, as you’ll see from the offers above, you can even save big on the Hero 10 camera this year. Don’t hang around if you want one of these. There are also offers on other GoPro models, including the Hero 7.</p>\n<h3>How to get a good GoPro deal on Black Friday</h3>\n<p>Here are a few tips to help you pick out the perfect GoPro deal on Black Friday:</p>\n<ul><li>Do your research. Don’t buy a product until you’ve read some online reviews.</li>\n<li>Make sure you know what you intend to buy by putting together a wishlist. Of course, you might find inspiration during your online browsing, but with retailers clamouring for your attention, it’s also important to focus on seeking out specific products</li>\n<li>Don’t take a price drop at face value. Often, retailers list hugely inflated RRPs, while in reality the products haven’t been that expensive for months or even years</li>\n<li>If you see a product you want, add it to your shopping basket and check the prices on other sites before you head to the checkout. Also keep in mind that major stores like John Lewis &amp; Partners and Currys PC World guarantee to match prices with other sellers</li>\n</ul><h3>Should I wait for Cyber Monday?</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, Cyber Monday has always been an online-only sales event, which isn’t likely to change this year. But since so much more shopping is now taking place online in the wake of the pandemic, we expect the sale to play out differently this year.</p>\n<p>We think there will be far less of a clear distinction between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year. Put simply, don’t stop browsing during that weekend, it could well be that’s when some new details surface online.</p>\n<p>And, if you see an awesome discount on the Friday, it’s perhaps not worth waiting until the Monday to see if the price drops again.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b83086ea57e309bf84577fd68fd3663211fa7e40240b2877ed021605036fa607","category":"Cycling"}
