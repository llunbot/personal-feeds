The paired Watch should update, and the affected complications should display weather data again (until they don't again â€“ your mileage may vary).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/clock-app-24-hour-setting.jpg\" alt width=\"2737\" height=\"1426\" />\r<br />\nHas your Apple Watch been affected by the Weather complications issue?
