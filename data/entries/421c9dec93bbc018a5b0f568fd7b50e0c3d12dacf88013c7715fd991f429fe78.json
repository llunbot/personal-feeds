In the wider attack, hackers targeted <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/politics/us-government-hit-cybeattack/index.html\">government agencies</a> as well as multiple global organizations, causing a breach that extends beyond US boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>While the effects of the MOVEit hack have been ongoing throughout the month of June, the most recent intrusion has hit over <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/bulletins/gd/ORDOT-36045f9?\">3.5 million</a> residents of Oregon and potentially over 3 million residents of Louisiana, all possessing driver’s licenses or state ID cards.
