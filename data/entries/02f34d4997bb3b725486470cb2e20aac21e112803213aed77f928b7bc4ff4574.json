Election queries now tend to come back with the refusal: \"I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search.\"</p>\n<p>Google's original plan in December was likely to disable election info so Gemini could avoid any political firestorms. Boy, did that not work out! When asked to generate images of people, Gemini quietly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/googles-hidden-ai-diversity-prompts-lead-to-outcry-over-historically-inaccurate-images/\">tacked diversity requirements</a> onto the image request; this practice led to offensive and historically inaccurate images along with a general refusal to generate images of white people. Last month that earned Google <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-google-gemini-white-people\">wall-to-wall coverage</a> in conservative news spheres along the lines of \"Google's woke AI hates white people!\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085445/google-ceo-gemini-ai-diversity-scandal-employee-memo\">called</a> the AI's \"biased\" responses \"completely unacceptable,\" and for now, creating images of people is disabled while Google works on it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009880#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009880&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"02f34d4997bb3b725486470cb2e20aac21e112803213aed77f928b7bc4ff4574","category":"Tech"}
