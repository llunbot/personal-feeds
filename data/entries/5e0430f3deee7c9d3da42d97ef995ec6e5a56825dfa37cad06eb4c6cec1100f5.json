But, if you want a great alternative that won’t cost you nearly as much. The <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/clarity-pro-27-inch-uhd-4k-monitor-with-65w-pd-and-webcam\">Alogic Clarity 4K monitor is 20% off, so you can get it for $800 right now</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 27-inch IPS monitor with a solid 4K resolution that looks gorgeous. That, of course, is important because if you’re going to bring a monitor into your Apple-friendly home, it needs to be at least as stylish as the Studio Display is. We reviewed the Alogic Clarity monitor and were impressed enough to give it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. “It will appeal to Mac users with its Apple looks and is even, in some ways, a superior monitor to Apple’s own Studio Display, although its 4K resolution isn’t quite as sharp as Apple’s 5K screen,” we wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This monitor excels at color accuracy, brightness, and 3000:1 contrast levels. The fact that it also has a built-in webcam makes this a one-stop shop for everyone who sometimes needs to join FaceTime or Zoom calls, and there’s also a super handy hub you can use that features HDMI, DisplayPort, and various USB-A ports. Furthermore, you can adjust the monitor’s height, tilt it, and swivel it however you see fit—features that vost hundreds more on the standard Studio Display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than paying $1,600 or more on the Apple Studio Display, save a bundle and get one of these <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/clarity-pro-27-inch-uhd-4k-monitor-with-65w-pd-and-webcam\">Clarity Pro 27″ monitors for $800 over at Alogic</a> instead..</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/clarity-pro-27-inch-uhd-4k-monitor-with-65w-pd-and-webcam\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Alogic</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5e0430f3deee7c9d3da42d97ef995ec6e5a56825dfa37cad06eb4c6cec1100f5","category":"Apple"}
