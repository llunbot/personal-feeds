At the\ntime the company hired the three software engineers, Rebecca\nRivers, Sophie Waldman and Paul Duke, they signed conduct rules\nthat included a “Don’t be evil” provision, according to the suit.</p>\n\n<p>The trio say they thought they were behaving in accordance with\nthat principle when they organized Google employees against\ncontroversial projects, such as work for U.S. Customs and Border\nProtection during the Trump administration. The workers\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@no.gcp.for.cbp?p=88c60e1fc35e\">circulated a petition</a> calling on Google to publicly commit\nto not working with CBP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This feels like a publicity stunt, not the grounds for a serious lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Steve Jobs in an Apple Town Hall meeting back in January 2010: “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/31/jobs-town-all\"><em>Don’t be evil</em> is a load of crap.</a>”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/02/google-dont-be-evil-lawsuit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"259fa42bd7cb698e24d40850e743120c7b3f70e8cc30f8be6b4316b69055506b","category":"Tech"}
