Even though the iPhone 16 series has only just launched, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">May 2023</a>, rumors about a two-generations-away iPhone isn't all that unusual so far ahead of time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWhile we continue to acclimatize to the new iPhone 16 series, here's a compilation of everything we have heard from reputable sources so far about Apple's so-called iPhone 17 \"Air.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>iPhone 17 Air: Rumors So Far</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>About the Name</span><br />\r<br />\nApple's rumored slimmer iPhone 17, previously referred to as the iPhone 17 \"Slim,\" could be positioned as an iPhone \"Air\" to boost sales, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. There has been uncertainty in recent months about the intention of the so-called ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Slim\" and its rumored position in the lineup. YouTuber Jon Prosser was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8c7HWZRO_D8?feature=shared\">first to suggest</a> that the device could be positioned as an \"‌iPhone‌ Air.\" Now, Gurman seems to support this idea. Replacing the iPhone \"Plus,\" which, like the \"mini\" models before it, has not sold well, the ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Air\" will represent a new approach to the fourth model in Apple's iPhone lineup, offering a device with a substantially thinner design that sits between the ‌iPhone 17‌ and ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro. Gurman has compared the device to the original MacBook Air from 2008, which sat between the regular MacBook and MacBook Pro in the lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Thinner Design</span><br />\r<br />\nAccording to <em><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025\">The Information</a></em>, Apple's all-new iPhone 17 model next year will have a \"significantly thinner\" design with an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like Apple's Pro models. The news outlet also claims that the device will feature a narrower Dynamic Island (potentially due to Apple's adoption of a smaller \"metalens\" for the Face ID system) although this specific claim has since been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">contested</a>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the handset to have a titanium frame, but with a lower percentage of titanium than used for the iPhone 15 Pro models. Internally code-named D23, the device's redesign has been described as a major one equivalent to the iPhone X.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Smaller Display</span><br />\r<br />\nThe first details about the size of the device's display arrived courtesy of Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said it would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/\">6.6 inches</a>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">corroborated</a> Pu's claim. However, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young</a>, it will feature a 6.55-inch display. For comparison, the iPhone 16 Plus has a 6.7-inch display. Apple is still said to be testing different designs for the slimmer phone, so the display size could always change between now and the device's launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>ProMotion Support</span><br />\r<br />\nApple intends to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/\">expand</a> ProMotion to the entire lineup in 2025, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/\">including the iPhone 17 \"Air,\"</a> allowing all iPhone 17 models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only \"Pro\" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have supported ProMotion. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 \"Air\" to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Relocated Cameras</span><br />\r<br />\n<em>The Information</em> claimed that the iPhone 17 \"Slim\" or \"Air\" will have cameras in locations we haven't seen before on an iPhone. According to a May report, the rear cameras could be moved to the \"top center\" of the device. Some Android phones like Google's Pixel 8 Pro have rear cameras in a top-center position, but Apple's iPhone camera system has occupied the top-left corner ever since the 2007 model. To add to the intrigue, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has claimed that the device will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">only one camera</a>, as opposed to two or three.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Anti-Reflective Coating</span><br />\r<br />\nAll iPhone 17 models will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/\">Chinese Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 series is said to have a \"super-hard anti-reflective layer\" that is \"more scratch-resistant.\" It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>ProMotion Technology</span><br />\r<br />\nAccording to <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/iphone-17-always-on-promotion-displays/\">The Elec</a></em>, all iPhone 17 models will feature OLED displays with low-power backplane technology, bringing ProMotion to Apple's non-Pro iPhone models for the first time. ProMotion allows the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when required. ProMotion also allows the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, which is why the iPhone 16 Pro screens feature an always-on capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Improved Selfie Camera</span><br />\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup features the same hardware. The upgraded resolution on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Internal Upgrades</span><br />\r<br />\nHaitong analyst Jeff Pu <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/\">claims</a> the iPhone 17 \"Slim\" or \"Air\" will feature 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB of RAM on the iPhone 15 Plus. It's worth noting that all iPhone 16 models are fitted with 8GB of RAM – a hardware requirement of on-device Apple Intelligence. According to <em>The Information</em>, the device will also be equipped with Apple's A19 chip, which is likely to be based on an optimized version of TSMC's 3nm process, possibly N3P or N3X. The device may also be one of the first to use an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">Apple-made 5G modem</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Higher Price</span><br />\r<br />\n<em>The Information</em> reported that the slimmer iPhone 17 could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at $1,199, despite suggestions that it will not be as feature-rich as Apple's top-tier Max. The cool factor of a completely new thinner design is expected to entice customers nonetheless. Gurman believes that the design of the ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Air\" will \"just be a step toward something better\" since Apple will eventually want to \"squeeze the power of a Pro model into this smaller design.\" However, he does not expect this to occur before 2027 at the earliest.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 17 Air: Everything We Know About Apple's Slim iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-slim-iphone.2430727/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"79d983759662d99ae995e0a320878ed10a21054ee46ec09e4a1f28bf054b5374","category":"Apple"}
