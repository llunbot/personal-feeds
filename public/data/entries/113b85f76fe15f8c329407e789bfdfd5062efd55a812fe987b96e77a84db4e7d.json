We've updated the article accordingly. We've also added a reference to the free version of Outlook being ad-supported.</p>\n<p><strong>Original story: </strong>Microsoft is making the Outlook for Mac app free to use, the company <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/outlook-mac-for-all/ba-p/3757787\">announced this week</a>. Previously available with a Microsoft 365 account or as part of the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/office-home-business-2021/cfq7ttc0hpn4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab\">Office for Mac</a> app suite, the Outlook app is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id985367838?mt=12\">downloadable from the Mac App Store</a> and works with Outlook.com, Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, and plain old IMAP and POP email accounts. The free version of Outlook will look and work mostly the same way as the paid version, but it will be ad supported.</p>\n<p>Microsoft already offers a free version of the Outlook client for <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Android</a>, and it's currently testing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/microsoft-previews-a-new-totally-redesigned-outlook-for-windows-app/\">a preview of a redesigned Outlook app</a> that will replace the free built-in Mail and Calendar apps that ship with Windows 11.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921015#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921015&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"113b85f76fe15f8c329407e789bfdfd5062efd55a812fe987b96e77a84db4e7d","category":"Tech"}
