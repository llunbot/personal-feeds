So, if you have an iPhone 14 Pro should you trade up to the new model or if you find an iPhone 14 Pro at a good price should you buy it?  Which iPhone is the best to buy? We compare the generational iPhone flagships to help you make the right decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: Tech specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2091512/iphone-15-pro-review.html\">iPhone 15 Pro (review)</a></td><td><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1070324/iphone-14-pro-review.html\">iPhone 14 Pro (review)</a></td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>6.1-inch 2,556×1,179 460ppi Super Retina XDR OLED display; 1,600/2,000 nits peak brightness (HDR/outdoor); Dynamic Island, ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate, Always On display</td><td>6.1-inch 2,556×1,179 460ppi Super Retina XDR OLED display; 1,600/2,000 nits peak brightness (HDR/outdoor); Dynamic Island, ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate, Always On display</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>A17 Pro</td><td>A16 Bionic</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB</td><td>128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB</td></tr><tr><td>Rear Camera</td><td>48MP f/1.78 Main, 12MP f/2.2 Ultra Wide, 12MP f/2.8 Telephoto, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 3x optical zoom, Smart HDR 5</td><td>48MP f/1.78 Main, 12MP f/2.2 Ultra Wide, 12MP f/2.8 Telephoto, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 3x optical zoom, Smart HDR 4</td></tr><tr><td>Front Camera</td><td>12MP TrueDepth, f/1.9</td><td>12MP TrueDepth, f/1.9</td></tr><tr><td>Video Recording</td><td>4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, ProRes video recording up to 4K at 60 fps with external recording, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision up to 4K at 60 fps, Cinematic mode, Action Mode, Macro, Log video, Academy Color Encoding System</td><td>4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, ProRes video recording up to 4K at 30 fps with external recording, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision up to 4K at 60 fps, Cinematic mode, Action Mode, Macro</td></tr><tr><td>Biometric Security</td><td>Face ID</td><td>Face ID</td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E</td><td>Wi-Fi 6</td></tr><tr><td>LTE</td><td>5G</td><td>5G</td></tr><tr><td>Charging</td><td>USB-C, Up to 50% charge in 30 minutes</td><td>Lightning, Up to 50% charge in 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Charging</td><td>Yes, with MagSafe</td><td>Yes, with MagSafe</td></tr><tr><td>Battery life</td><td>Up to 23 hours video playback</td><td>Up to 23 hours video playback</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>5.3</td><td>5.3</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Pay</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Waterproofing</td><td>IP68</td><td>IP68</td></tr><tr><td>SIM</td><td>Dual (nano and eSIM except in the US where there is no support for physical SIM cards)</td><td>Dual (nano and eSIM except in the US where there is no support for physical SIM cards)</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>5.77 x 2.78 x 0.32 inches<br />146.6mm x 70.6mm x 8.25mm</td><td>147.5mm x 71.5mm x 7.85mm</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>6.60oz / 187g</td><td>206g</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick look at the table above will show that these two phones are very similar. This isn’t surprising, as they are only a generation apart so upgrades tend to be incremental rather than groundbreaking. That being said, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2091512/iphone-15-pro-review.html\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> does have the brand new A17 Pro chipset, which Apple claims is “an entirely new class of iPhone chip that delivers our best graphics performance by far”. This is backed up by the company stating that the new processor has a 20% faster GPU than its predecessor, 10% faster CPU, and 4x faster ray tracing to give graphics a real boost. As a comparison, if you’re back on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234762/iphone-12-pro-review-the-iphone-thats-future-proof.html\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> for example, then Apple states that the A17 Pro is up to 70% faster than the GPU in that model.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another small but noticeable difference is that the iPhone 15 Pro moves from the proprietary Lightning port found on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1070324/iphone-14-pro-review.html\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> to the long-anticipated USB-C standard (with a little help from a change in EU laws). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many other areas, the two devices are the same. Both come in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage configurations, have 5G (sub-6 GHz and mmWave) with 4×4 MIMO capabilities, the 14 Pro offers Wi-Fi 6 while the 15 Pro bumps it slightly up to Wi-Fi 6E. The other features that separate the two models appear mainly in the construction and camera departments, as we’ll explore below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more advice read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670458/iphone-buying-guide.html\">iPhone Buying Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">Best iPhone comparison chart</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: Design &amp; build</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has gone with a Titanium band to surround the aluminum chassis in the iPhone 15 Pro as opposed to the Stainless Steel that enveloped the iPhone 14 Pro. This switch makes the new model around 20g lighter, aided by the fact that the company has shaved off some of the dimensions this time around. Here’s how the two iPhone measure up:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro – 146.6mm x 70.6mm x 8.25mm; 187g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14 Pro – 147.5mm x 71.5mm x 7.85mm; 206g</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Textured matte glass backs appear on both, along with a selection of color schemes. On the iPhone 15 Pro you have Natural Titanium, Blue Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium liveries.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro: Gründe gegen den Kauf\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15-Pro-.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>iPhone 15 Pro in various shades of titanium.</p> </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone 14 Pro comes in Deep Purple, Gold, Silver, and Space Black. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3817547/iphone14pro_familia.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iphone14pro_familia.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a new hardware feature on the iPhone 15 Pro, where the classic mute switch has been replaced with a programmable Action button (inspired by the Apple Watch). This allows you to assign one of several functions (such as opening the camera, turning on the flashlight or enabling Focus mode) to the button so that it’s instantly executed when pressed. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro Action button\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-button-1.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, it’s the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR panel in either model, boasting a 2,556 x 1,179 resolution, 440ppi, 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate, the Dynamic Island, Always On feature, HDR, True Tone, Haptic Touch, Wide color display, and typical max brightness of 1,000 nits or 1,600 nits in HDR and 2,000 nits in outdoor mode. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery life is identical, with Apple stating that the models will manage 23 hours of video playback, and can fast charge back to 50% in 30 minutes when using a 20W charger (not included). You can also use Qi or MagSafe wireless charging, although the speeds will usually be slower. Both iPhones also come with an iP68 waterproof rating, so they should survive a quick dip without frying the circuit boards. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: Cameras</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, Apple has stuck with the script here, as both devices have the same camera arrays. On the back you’ll find the trifecta of a 48MP f/1.78 main, 12MP f/2.2 Ultra Wide, alongside the 12MP f/2.8 Telephoto sensor. The new A17 Pro silicon does allow for some upgrades to the processing though, with the newer device coming with Smart HDR 5 (the 14 Pro has Smart HDR 4) and being able to record ProRes video at 4K and 60fps, while the 14 Pro maxed out at 4K/30fps. Photos now default to 24MP, which is double the to resolution found on the 14 Pro, plus videographers will no doubt enjoy the introduction of log encoding on ProRes footage, which should open up the range of color grading and visual effects in post-production, plus the iPhone 15 Pro is the first smartphone (well, alongside the iPhone 15 Pro Max) to implement the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) which enables movie-level color grading capabilities on an iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, these features are only really going to be relevant if you’re a hardcore video content creator that intends to spend a lot of time working in the edit suite. If you just want great quality photos and videos for your personal archive or to post online, then the iPhone 14 Pro still boasts the Cinematic and Action modes that will make anything you capture look professional, while the triple camera array delivers a wider range of options for taking high-quality shots. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the introduction of the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple has stopped selling the 14 Pro, although you can still pick up the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1073091/iphone-14-review.html\">iPhone 14</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1656045/iphone-14-plus-review-2.html\">iPhone 14 Plus</a> if they better suit your needs. Despite this you should still be able to pick up the iPhone 14 Pro from third-party retailers and phone networks as they sell through their stock, so we’ve provided the pricing that Apple set for both models so you’ll know how much you should expect to pay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to see more deals on the iPhone 15 series take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2075192/iphone-15-plus-pro-max-best-deals-carriers-uk.html\">Best U.K. iPhone 15 deals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2073364/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-best-deals-carriers-stores-online.html\">Best U.S. iPhone 15 deals</a> round ups. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>128GB: $999 / £999 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>256GB: $1,099 / £1,099 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>512GB: $1,299 / £1,299 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>1TB: $1,499 / £1,499 </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/best-buy-logo.png\" alt=\"Best Buy\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$999.99</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6525404&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6525404%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-2115904-4-2067362-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 14 Pro</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>128GB: $999 / £1,099 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>256GB: $1,099 / £1,209  </li>\n\n\n\n<li>512GB: $1,299 / £1,429  </li>\n\n\n\n<li>1TB: $1,499 / £1,649 </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the prices Apple sold the iPhone 14 Pro for.

You won’t get much extra for your money, only you’re a serious videographer that intends to use your smartphone to create movies, then the new color-grading capabilities might appeal. Yes, the 15 Pro does come with a brand new chipset, which seems optimized for gaming, but the 14 Pro was never really a slouch in that department. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you be considering moving up from an older model, then the choice becomes more complicated. Apple no longer sells the iPhone 14 Pro (at least until it shows up in the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2115904-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone\">Apple Refurbished Store</a>), so you’d need to get one of those from another retailer. You may find a good deal on the iPhone 14 Pro, but bear in mind that in some places outside the U.S. the iPhone 15 Pro is actually cheaper than the iPhone 14 Pro was, so make sure the deals reflect that. The iPhone 15 Pro does have all the latest specs that make it the premium handset of choice for many Apple fans. But both iPhones are great, as for the most part they’re the same iPhone, so we’d suggest looking for the best deal you can find. You can’t go wrong with either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering what other features come with the new iPhone 15 series?
