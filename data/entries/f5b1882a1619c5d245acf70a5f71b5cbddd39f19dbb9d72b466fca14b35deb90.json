The Ortlieb Repair initiative builds on their already great 5-year waterproof warranty and durable made-in-Germany construction that means your Ortlieb bags will really stand up to some serious abuse, and are totally worth their cost. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ortlieb Repair Week: fix bags, instead of just buying new gear</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Factory Tour: Made-in-Germany waterproof cycling bags, hardware repairs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_hardware-repairs-with-Pikachu-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But eventually, everything can wear out, and Ortlieb wants owners of “aggressively-loved bags” to know that they can get them back in functional shape again easily. Out-of-warranty repair costs vary depending on how much needs to be fixed. But in this Repair Weeks program, you can get them fixed for 40% off the usual cost. Just reach out to get the ball rolling, either at your local Ortlieb shop that does in-house repairs, or through your national distributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hit them up in their home country <a href=\"https://www.ortlieb.com/de_en/repair-weeks\">in German here</a>, or in English in the <a href=\"https://www.ortlieb.com/uk_en/repair-weeks\" target=\"_blank\">UK here</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.ortlieb.com/usa_en/repair-weeks\" target=\"_blank\">USA here</a>.

That makes the UK the third major European region to get shop-level repairs, after Benelux repair training earlier this year added to the tons of repair dealers in Ortlieb’s home German market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>ORTLIEB Sportartikel GmbH is known for the good repairability of its products. In order to make the repair services as sustainable as possible, ORTLIEB has been working for several years on establishing a regional dealer network for repairs directly on site. Now that the network includes most of the international distribution partners and almost 80 service dealers in Germany, the network has been gradually expanded this year to include dealers in other European countries.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Factory Tour: Made-in-Germany waterproof cycling bags, back at their birthplace\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_post-ride-Heilsbronn-HQ-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We repair around 18,000 products a year at our site in Heilsbronn, where all our products are manufactured. Being able to offer repairs on site not only avoids unnecessary shipping routes, but also leads to shorter waiting times for customers and brings additional customer footfall into the store. <br /><br />Sustainable management is essential, it has always been part of ORTLIEB’s DNA and is an aspiration at the same time. Responsible use of the natural resources we have means, above all, that products should be as durable as possible. Because by far the most important sustainability aspect of a product is its longevity. In our efforts to maximize the service life of our products, their reparability has always played a central role alongside our production process and the materials used. The expansion of our repair network allows us to make retailers and consumers even more aware of the advantages of products that are as repairable as possible, while at the same time making them a regional and direct experience.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Martin Esslinger, Ortlieb CEO </em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Repair, don’t just rebuy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>There are some Black Friday buying deals on new gear, too!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ortlieb Factory Tour: Made-in-Germany waterproof cycling bags, warehousing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ortlieb-Factory-Tour_premium-waterproof-commuter-bikepacking-bags_Made-in-Germany_warehouse-stock-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, if you do have to buy something new, you can get great <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/b/ortlieb/c/cycling?cm_mmc=aff_AL-_-5889-_-293233-_-NA&amp;avad=293233_e3dbe3295\" target=\"_blank\">Ortlieb Black Friday Deals now at REI</a>, or buy <a href=\"https://alnk.to/2QuxcTq\" target=\"_blank\">straight from the source, too</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ortlieb.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ortlieb.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ortlieb-repair-week-reminds-us-to-try-fixing-your-gear-before-just-buying-new-kit/\">Ortlieb Repair Week Reminds Us To Try Fixing Your Gear Before Just Buying New Kit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f5b1882a1619c5d245acf70a5f71b5cbddd39f19dbb9d72b466fca14b35deb90","category":"Cycling"}
