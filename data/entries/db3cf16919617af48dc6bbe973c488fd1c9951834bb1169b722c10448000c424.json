{"title":"Apple Settles Family Sharing Subscription Lawsuit","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-settles-family-sharing-lawsuit/","date":1702663540000,"content":"Apple has agreed to <a href=\"http://petersfamilysharingplan.com\">settle a class action lawsuit</a> over Family Sharing, and will pay out $25 million to put an end to the case. First filed in 2019, the lawsuit accused Apple of misrepresenting the way that subscriptions to third-party apps worked with the Family Sharing feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-family-sharing.jpg\" width=\"2190\" height=\"1232\" />\r<br />\nWhile Family Sharing allows participants to share subscriptions with one another, app developers can opt out of allowing a single subscription to be shared among multiple people. Not all subscriptions can be shared because of the opt out policy, which is what led to the lawsuit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThough Apple has agreed to a settlement, the company says it did nothing wrong and denies making misleading misrepresentations. Apple decided to avoid the potential cost and burden of a jury trial.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nU.S. Apple users who participated in a Family Sharing group with at least one other member and purchased a subscription to an app through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> between June 21, 2015 and January 30, 2019 are eligible for a payment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEach class member that files a claim is set to get $30, though that total will vary depending on how many claims are made. The payout will not exceed $50 per claimant, and up to $10 million will go toward attorney fees. Emails about the lawsuit settlement are being sent out to eligible customers as of this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCustomers have until March 1, 2024 to file a claim, and a final approval hearing is scheduled for April 2, 2024. More information can be found on the <a href=\"http://petersfamilysharingplan.com\">website for the settlement</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-settles-family-sharing-lawsuit/\">Apple Settles Family Sharing Subscription Lawsuit</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-settles-family-sharing-subscription-lawsuit.2413838/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db3cf16919617af48dc6bbe973c488fd1c9951834bb1169b722c10448000c424","category":"Apple"}
