It’s a large-screen visual you can customize–similar to your Lock Screen–that displays on other iPhone users’ screens when you call them or when they display your contact information. Apple’s making it easy to share it with others…you can swap Contact Posters just by holding the top of your iPhone next to someone else’s for a few seconds using Apple’s NameDrop feature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, you’ll need to get started by making your Contact Poster look just the way you want. Here’s how.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  5 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: none</li><li>Materials required: iPhone with iOS 17</li><li>Cost: 0</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Open your Contact card</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ios17-contact-poster-how-to1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 17 contact poster how to\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>First, you need to open your Contact Card.
