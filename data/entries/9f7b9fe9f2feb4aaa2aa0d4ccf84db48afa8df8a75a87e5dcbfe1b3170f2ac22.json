jersey is designed for riding in the hottest conditions and for that peak season racing. While we may not be blessed with blistering temperatures in the UK at the moment, we’re bound to get another dose of heat before the summer’s out and the Pro Team jersey will be ready for action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jersey is made from ultralight fabric and has a high stretch construction which Rapha says helps keep you cool and comfortable. There are four colours – I opted for an olive green as shown here – and there is a raised collar to protect your neck from the elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/shop/womens-pro-team-jersey/product/JPW01SS\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha (£150)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Udog Distanza gravel shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Udog distanza gravel shoes in black\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ITD_udog_distanza-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Distanza gravel shoes are Udog’s first foray into off-road footwear. The shoes feature the Tension Wrap System (TWS) which uses TPU-laminated straps to wrap under and hug the rider’s foot when the upper laces are fully fastened. Udog says this helps promote efficient pedalling, as the foot is supported on both the up- and down-stroke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Distanzas have an oversize rubber outsole which runs the full length of the shoe and comes up and over the front to act as a toe bumper. The upper is made from a 3D engineered lightweight mesh, which Udog says is both breathable and highly durable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoes are available in two models and the top-tier offering, shown here, features a carbon-reinforced sole.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://udog.cc/products/distanza-carbon-cinder-black\" target=\"_blank\">Udog (£220)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Muc-Off Helmet Care Kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Helmet cleaning guide\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/helmet_cleaning_guide-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This week we did an entire guide on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-clean-bike-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">how to clean your bike helmet</a> and, while warm soapy water can do just fine, it’s nice to have a dedicated kit that comes with all the essentials.

My dog, Loki, however is clearly the best and here’s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>He’s adorable – look at those eyes</li><li>He has recently learned to not run away whenever I take him off the lead and the pride I feel is what I imagine it’s like when parents watch their toddler walk for the first time</li><li>He’s adopted and has never once accused me of ‘not being his real mum’ – he’s only two, so maybe there’s still time for teenage tantrums</li><li>He forces me to go outside and embrace nature even when it’s pouring with rain. Sitting behind a desk all day isn’t great for the soul and if I don’t walk him, he’ll drive me bananas so it’s a win/win for everybody.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe your dog can do lots of cool tricks or bark the alphabet but I’ll still say that mine is the best, even if I’m 99% sure he’s going through the bin as we speak.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/rapha-pro-team-jersey\">In The Drops: Rapha Pro Team jersey, Udog Distanza gravel shoes, Muc-Off Helmet Care kit, the ’23 Million Miles’ challenge and dogs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Charlotte Head &#124; Tech Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9f7b9fe9f2feb4aaa2aa0d4ccf84db48afa8df8a75a87e5dcbfe1b3170f2ac22","category":"Cycling"}
