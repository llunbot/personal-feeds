We have some issues with the entry level model’s price, but this deal makes it wasy to recommend: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-8%E2%80%91core-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5JV268/\">The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is $300 off at Amazon</a>, making it available for purchase for a palatable $1,299, the same price as the 13-inch model it replaced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This laptop features a powerful M3 chip with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, easily sustaining any task you have to perform, either for fun or for work, and the screen is a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with an amazing 500nits of brightness, ensuring you can use it anywhere you go. In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2191793/14-inch-macbook-pro-m3-review.html\">our review</a> of the M3 MacBook Pro, our expert gave it a 4-star rating, praising the device’s powerful performance, as well as the excellent display and speakers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The audio quality from the six-speaker sound system with force-canceling woofers leaves nothing to be desired–external speakers are superfluous. It’s another big improvement over the stereo speakers in the 13-inch MacBook Pro,” we noted. Basically, you can rely on the built-in speakers for Zoom calls or music while you work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M3 MacBook Pro also promises a fantastic battery life of more than 20 hours on a single charge. That’s more than enough to get through a workday (and some overtime) without missing your charger. It’s time to save $300 and get yourself an amazing laptop, as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-8%E2%80%91core-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5JV268/\">MacBook Pro is down to $1,299 at Amazon</a> right now.</p>\n\n\n<span>The MacBook Pro M3 has a great price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-8%E2%80%91core-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5JV268/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"57be860aec4072868e5af65de055b0655c70146c6bb5aa7a4697045efe0e3a2d","category":"Apple"}
