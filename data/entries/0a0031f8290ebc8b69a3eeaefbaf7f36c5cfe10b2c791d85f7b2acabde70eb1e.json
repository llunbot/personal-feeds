A number that is normally 858-867-5309, for example, is being displayed on the ‌iPhone‌ as +85 88675309.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been numerous complaints about the issue as of about an hour ago, with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/13l6l8d/major_bug_texts_are_coming_in_where_my_phone_is/\">several threads</a> on Reddit from confused users who have suddenly broken chat threads. It is not known what is causing the bug, but many of the reports seem to be from AT&amp;T users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nResetting network settings may fix the issue, and there are currently mixed reports on whether the bug has been addressed server side. Adding a +1 to the number may also fix the problem for those who are continuing to see formatting problems.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/iphone-text-bug-non-imessage/\">Curious iPhone Bug Causing Non-iMessage Texts to Display Extra + Character, Breaking Conversations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/curious-iphone-bug-causing-non-imessage-texts-to-display-extra-character-breaking-conversations.2389911/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a0031f8290ebc8b69a3eeaefbaf7f36c5cfe10b2c791d85f7b2acabde70eb1e","category":"Apple"}
