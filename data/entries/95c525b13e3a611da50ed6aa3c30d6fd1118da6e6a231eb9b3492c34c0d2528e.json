That means it's time to look back on the best vehicles we tested in 2023. It has been a good year for electric vehicles, which accounted for almost one in ten new vehicles sold in the US this year. We've also driven some rather good hybrids, as well as a pair of sports cars that reminded us that there's still room for enthusiast cars. Read on to find out which cars made the cut.</p>\n<h2>1. Polestar 2</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Polestar-2-1-scaled-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"You'd be hard-pressed to spot the difference between the 2023 Polestar 2 and the 2024 Polestar 2, but the improvements are obvious when you drive one.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Polestar-2-1-scaled-2-980x735.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Polestar-2-1-scaled-2.jpg\">You'd be hard-pressed to spot the difference between the 2023 Polestar 2 and the 2024 Polestar 2, but the improvements are obvious when you drive one.</a> (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p></div>\n<p>In addition to claiming the top spot in 2023, Polestar might also win a prize for the most significant reengineering job for a midlife refresh. Normally, an automaker might restyle the bumpers or change the headlights and tweak the interior when it gives a model its spruce-up after a few years on sale. Not Polestarâ€”it mostly left the cosmetics alone but moved the electric motor in the single-motor Polestar 2 from under the hood, where it drove the front wheels, to the rear, where it now drives the rear wheels.</p>\n<p>Combined with a bit of a bump in power (ok, 29 percent more power and 48 percent more torque), <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/now-rear-wheel-drive-the-single-motor-polestar-2-is-better-than-ever/\">the result is a real driver's car</a>, with better steering and handling than the front-wheel drive Polestar 2 it replaces. There's more standard equipment than before, and it's more efficient, too. Only about 30 percent of US Polestar customers have picked the single-motor model in the past, but they're missing out. The twin-motor car might be faster, but it's less engaging to drive, has less range, and costs a whole bunch more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992876#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992876&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
