The organization did this to protect the consumer and create a framework in which companies can categorize the sort of riding their bicycles have been engineered for.</p>\n<p>Close your eyes and imagine the number of bicycles being ridden right at this moment across the globe. That number has to be in the millions, right? Now think about the conditions these bicycles are being ridden in, from a toddler learning how to operate a balance bike, to a road group ride, perhaps a gravel race, or a dirt jump competition. Now think about each of the bicycle frames being ridden. What denotes their riding style? Is it the tire clearance? Or suspension? Frame material or weight?</p>\n<p>Subcommittee <a href=\"http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/SUBCOMMIT/F0810.htm\" target=\"_blank\">F08.10 </a>on Bicycles, part of ASTM International <a href=\"http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/COMMITTEE/F08.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Committee F08</a> on Sports Equipment and Facilities, is responsible <a href=\"https://newsroom.astm.org/newsroom-articles/astm-standard-bicycle-classification-usage-revised-proposed-trailer-cycles\" target=\"_blank\">for developing and keeping current standards of bicycle use up to date.</a></p>\n<p>And it’s been a while since those standards have been updated.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-193.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-193.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-193.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-193.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-176.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-176.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-176.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/09/Grinduro2019-176.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In 2009, this subcommittee <a href=\"http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/SUBCOMMIT/F0810.htm\">F08.10</a> published an important revision to one of its key standards. This revision was originally intended as a document to guide developers of other bicycle standards like <a href=\"http://www.astm.org/Standards/F2043.htm\">ASTM F2043</a> – aka Classification for Bicycle Usage – and has now been revised for use as an educational tool for both those in the bicycle industry and for consumers purchasing bikes.</p>\n<p>David Mitchell, an engineering consultant from MET Ltd., a UK-based materials testing and engineering lab, and an F08.10 subcommittee member, states the revision of the ASTM <a href=\"http://www.astm.org/Standards/F2043.htm\">F2043</a> classification was prompted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission who expressed an interest in the standard as a means to guide bicycle purchasers in selecting a proper bike for its intended use.</p>\n<p>The byproduct of these subcommittee revisions is a five-part Condition Classification expressing intended bicycle uses and incorporating a standard naming scheme that would apply to all manufacturers.</p>\n<p>Wait a second, did we just write “standard” and “all manufacturers” in the same sentence? In the bike industry? <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NTsXtu3ivko?si=HJOznstdPHBQY91X&amp;t=1\" target=\"_blank\">Pffffffffffft</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-0.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-0.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-0.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-0.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>ASTM Conditions</h3>\n<p>The five uses are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Condition 0 — Adult supervision required, no traffic;</li>\n<li>Condition 1 — Suitable for road riding (only);</li>\n<li>Condition 2 — For off-road riding and jumps less than 12 in. (30 cm.);</li>\n<li>Condition 3 — For rough off-road riding and jumps less than 24 in. (61 cm.); and</li>\n<li>Condition 4 — For extreme off-road riding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is that there is no transparency on the consumer side of these products. Hell, even on the media side of this topic, we have to ask brands directly if it’s okay to showcase a bike being ridden a certain way.</p>\n<p>What is interesting about these Conditions is it goes from a 24″ jump to “extreme off-road riding” – which we have learned is akin to RedBull Rampage-level riding. Yet, the sorts of rigors BMX frames face are unclassified.</p>\n<p><em>“There is not currently a designation for BMX-style riding,”</em> says Mitchell. <em>“As bicycles evolve, the subcommittee intends to add additional designations for BMX use and other areas.”</em> Mitchell notes that engineering personnel who can define new levels of bicycle use are welcome to join in the subcommittee’s work on future revisions to ASTM <a href=\"http://www.astm.org/Standards/F2043.htm\">F2043</a>.</p>\n<p>This was a press release from 2009, and there haven’t been any substantial updates to ASTM testing since, only for recommended BMX helmet use.</p>\n<p>This begs the question: when gravel bikes are ridden on mountain bike singletrack and people review those bikes as being capable machines for such terrain, would it be beneficial for the brands to be transparent about ASTM testing? We’re less concerned about mountain bikes being used as mountain bikes, but as “road,” “all-road,” “gravel,” and “<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/drop-bar-29er-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">drop bar mountain bikes</a>” or “<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/adventure-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">adventure bikes</a>” are offered to consumers with very little delineation of use case, we have to wonder if these bikes would benefit from appropriate categorizations.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/BaileyMone-Wallride-scaled.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/BaileyMone-Wallride-scaled.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/BaileyMone-Wallride-scaled.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/BaileyMone-Wallride-scaled.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>ISO Testing: Engineering Specificity</h3>\n<p>We reached out to a number of brands, all in the “off-road, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/drop-bar-29er-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">drop-bar</a>” sector, which we primarily review here at The Radavist, asking them which Conditions they rate their bikes for, of which all deflected the question with a simple statement:</p>\n<p><em>“We adhere to our manufacturer’s ISO testing standards.”</em></p>\n<p>What they are referring to <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/ics/43.150/x/\" target=\"_blank\">ISO standards</a>, which offer more exact testing requirements for frames and components to pass/fail. ISO 4210-2:2023 includes the requirements for city/trekking, young adult, mountain, and racing bicycles.</p>\n<p>ISO 4210-2:2023 gets into the weeds and specifies the exact safety and performance requirements for the design, assembly, and testing of bike frames and complete bicycles. It lays down guidelines for manufacturer’s instructions on the use and care of such bicycles. As such, ISO is deemed as more of an “internal” language for the testing of bicycles and less of a “public facing” testing standardization.</p>\n<p>If you’re buying a bike and it says it adheres to ISO 4210, do you even know what that means?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Grinduro_California_2025-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Grinduro_California_2025-03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Grinduro_California_2025-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Grinduro_California_2025-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>These specs are written in engineering talk from a product, research, and development aspect, and less of a marketing use-case scenario as with the case of ASTM standards. As such, they are incredibly nuanced and complex, making it hard for consumers to understand exactly how these products are to be used. </strong></p>\n<p>Even ISO standards do not apply to “stunt bicycles,” as the opening article of <a href=\"https://blog.ansi.org/iso-4210-2-2023-trekking-mountain-racing-bicycles/\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 4210-2:2023</a> states:</p>\n<p><em>“This document does not apply to specialized types of bicycle, such as delivery bicycles, recumbent bicycles, tandems, BMX bicycles, and bicycles designed and equipped for use in severe applications such as sanctioned competition events, stunting, or aerobatic maneuvers.”</em></p>\n<p>So what gives? If brands aren’t using ASTM to classify their products and ISO standards don’t encapsulate “stunting,” where does that leave us?  To fill in the gaps here, Taiwanese manufacturers adhere to the <a href=\"https://en.tbnet.org.tw/test-service-capacity/8#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20keep%20up%20the%20competitiveness%20of%20our%20bicycle%20industry%20in%20the%20international%20market%2C%20the%20technical%20expert%20committee%20of%20TBIS%20uses%20ISO%204210%20as%20their%20investigation%20basis%20and%20propose%20a%20higher%20level%20of%20product%20safety%20and%20standard%20service%2C%20to%20establish%20TBIS%20especially%20for%20this%20purpose.\" target=\"_blank\">Taiwan Bicycle Industry Standard,</a> which was launched in 2015.</p>\n<p>One brand that also wished to remain anonymous mentioned, <em>“Testing is difficult to discuss, which is perhaps why CPSC standards exist.”</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/ArgonautCyclesinBend-72.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/ArgonautCyclesinBend-72.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/ArgonautCyclesinBend-72.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/ArgonautCyclesinBend-72.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>CPSC is Vague, Too</h3>\n<p>More broadly, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/bicycle-requirements-business-guidance\" target=\"_blank\">CPSC standards</a> help dictate a certain degree of requirements but lack any real meat worthy of classification for use cases:</p>\n<blockquote><p>1: Adults of normal intelligence (<em>lol</em>) and ability (<em>lol</em>) must be able to assemble a bicycle that requires assembly.</p>\n<p>2: A bicycle may not have unfinished sheared metal edges or other sharp parts that may cut a rider’s hands or legs. Sheared metal edges must be rolled or finished to remove burrs or feathering.</p>\n<p>3: When the bicycle is tested for braking (§1512.18(d) and/or (e)) or road performance (§1512.18(p) or (q)), neither the frame, nor any steering part, wheel, pedal, crank, or braking system part may show a visible break.</p>\n<p>4: Screws, bolts, and nuts used to fasten parts may not loosen, break, or fail during testing.</p>\n<p>5: Control cables must be routed so that they do not fray from contact with fixed parts of a bicycle or with the ends of the cable sheaths. The ends of control cables must be capped or treated so that they do not unravel.</p>\n<p>6: A bicycle may not have any protrusions within the shaded area of Diagram 1. However, control cables up to ¼ inch thick and cable clamps made of material not thicker than 3/16 inch may be attached to the top tube.</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whomp, whomp.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it comes down to the fact that we live in a litigious society, and brands/manufacturers are afraid of liability lawsuits. One company that, surprise surprise, wishes to remain anonymous told us that if <em>“we tell people our forks are rated to 24″ or Condition 03 riding, then they are in fact engineered to 40″ drops just to cover our butt.” </em>Another company stated: <em>“So officially unofficial off the record statement is we don’t use ASTM because ISO exceeds ASTM rating and we, like all reputable brands, produce components that exceed ISO.”</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Media’s Responsibility and ISO ASTM Testing</h3>\n<p>Editorially, over here at The Radavist, this puts us in a unique position to begin prying for ISO or ASTM standards testing Conditions – assuming the brands classify their products within the ISO or ASTM framework – in our product reviews. Perhaps through more transparency in product reviews, these discussions can help steer brands (and media) to uphold the realities of bicycle standards testing <em>on the ground</em>… and maybe keep our staff from jumping bikes that don’t meet Condition 02 or 03.</p>\n<p>This creates a conundrum, as we’ve found; what if brands aren’t willing to discuss this openly?</p>\n<p>I once shot a photo of a rider launching a big wall ride, which resulted in the company that made a component on the bike saying that component wasn’t rated to that sort of riding, which involved a 48″ drop. They said the component was “over-engineered” to resist this sort of riding, but the photo’s circulation on a website made them squeamish.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-029-scaled.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-029-scaled.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-029-scaled.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-029-scaled.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“Stunting” on drop bar bikes isn’t the only place we should be mindful of. There are a few use cases in particular that we’ve been wary of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nitto front racks installed on touring bikes or commuters without the “security strap,” which leads to failure. A simple toe strap around the <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/products/nitto-marks-rack-m1-20108#:~:text=ALWAYS%20use%20this%20rack%20with%20a%20tether%20between%20the%20tall%20tongue%2Dloop%20and%20the%20handlebar.%20It%27s%20a%20strong%20little%20rack%2C%20but%20people%20do%20dumb%20things%2C%20and%20the%20tether%20is%20a%20safety%20measure.%20Make%20the%20tether%20out%20of%20cord%20or%20any%20adjustable%20strap\" target=\"_blank\">handlebar and rack tongue loop</a> can save you if the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bikepacking/comments/1gus4x7/front_rack_broke_off_during_an_offroad_ride/\" target=\"_blank\">fork crown hardware snaps</a>.</li>\n<li>“Bikepacking”-style minimalist racks are being installed (improperly) on bikes without rack mounts, sometimes leading to frame failure as they are overloaded. This particularly becomes problematic with the ideology that “any bike is a bikepacking bike.” We’ve never done this editorially, but we saw it happen online during last year’s Tour Divide Race with a few misused racks.</li>\n<li>Overloading of bikes with rack mounts and then riding out of their designed terrain. I.e., a “gravel road” bike being overloaded and ridden down rocky doubletrack and jeep roads.</li>\n<li>Road stems and handlebars on drop bar mountain bikes or adventure bikes, ridden in mountain bike terrain, when they have not been tested to the rigors of MTB riding.</li>\n<li>Many, if not most, framebuilder bikes are not ISO tested. However, framebuilders work one-on-one with their customers to ensure the rider’s safety by engineering the appropriate tubing specifications. Many aren’t building a bike for the masses, only for that individual customer.</li>\n<li>Even though factories in Asia adhere to ISO, many overseas ISO testing facilities are also owned by the very factories that make the frames.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-034-scaled.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-034-scaled.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-034-scaled.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/12/YT_SZEPTER_MMEREDITH-034-scaled.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>What do you think? As a consumer, do these ASTM and ISO standards mean anything to you? Should bikes have a clear rating for their intended use? Would you like to see more transparency from brands on the degree of testing their bikes have received?</p>\n<p>Or perhaps the point of this entire article is whether there should be more transparent communication between a brand and its customer base about how its bikes ought to be ridden.</p>\n<p>Or… hear me out.
