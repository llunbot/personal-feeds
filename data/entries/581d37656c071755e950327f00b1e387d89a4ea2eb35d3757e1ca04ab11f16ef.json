It quietly migrated from laptops to game consoles, to PC accessories, to Android phones, to e-readers, and to iPhones. Despite some hiccups and shortcomings, we're considerably closer to a single connector that does <em>everything</em> than we were a decade ago.</p>\n<p>But some confusion persists. A weakness built into the USB-C from the very beginning was that the specification for the physical connector was always separate from the specifications for the USB Power Delivery specification for charging, the USB-C Alt Mode specification for carrying non-USB signals like DisplayPort or HDMI, and for the USB protocol itself (that is, the data transfer speed a given port is capable of).</p>\n<p>All of these specifications were frequently grouped together so that individual USB-C ports could handle charging, display output, and data transfers (or some combination of all three at once), but they weren't <em>required</em> to go together, so occasionally users will still run into physical USB-C ports that fall short of the port's do-everything promise.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-belatedly-attempts-to-tame-usb-c-confusion-with-its-rules-for-pc-oems/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-belatedly-attempts-to-tame-usb-c-confusion-with-its-rules-for-pc-oems/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"581d37656c071755e950327f00b1e387d89a4ea2eb35d3757e1ca04ab11f16ef","category":"Tech"}
