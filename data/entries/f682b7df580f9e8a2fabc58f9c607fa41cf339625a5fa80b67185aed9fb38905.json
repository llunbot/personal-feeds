They claim that Library Genesis (aka Libgen) is operated by unknown individuals based outside the United States, who know that the shadow library is \"one of the largest, most notorious, and far-reaching infringement operations in the world\" and intentionally violate copyright laws with \"absolutely no legal justification for what they do.\"</p>\n<p>According to publishers, Libgen offers free downloads for over 20,000 books that the publishers never authorized Libgen to distribute. They claim that Libgen is \"a massive piracy effort\" and note that their complaint may be updated if more infringed works are found. This vast infringement is causing publishers and authors serious financial and creative harm, publishers allege.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968849#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968849&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f682b7df580f9e8a2fabc58f9c607fa41cf339625a5fa80b67185aed9fb38905","category":"Tech"}
