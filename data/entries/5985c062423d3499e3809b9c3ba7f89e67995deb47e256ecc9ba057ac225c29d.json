In a <a href=\"https://cms.futureplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024.09.26-Trading-statement-FINAL.pdf\">financial disclosure</a> today, the company announced that it is closing a \"number of non-core or low to no growth assets,\" including a \"small number of print and digital brands.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFuture PLC also owns Android Central, TechRadar, Tom's Guide, Windows Central, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iMore's History</h2>\r<br />\nThe website that eventually became iMore has operated under various names for over 17 years. The site originally launched as PhoneDifferent.com in 2007, merged with and took the name of TheiPhoneBlog.com in 2008, and abbreviated its domain name to TiPb.com in 2010. In 2012, the website rebranded as iMore.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niMore has been home to a number of well-known technology journalists over the years, including Dieter Bohn, Rene Ritchie, Serenity Caldwell, and many others. Bohn went on to become a founding member of The Verge in 2011, and he now works at Google. Ritchie left iMore in 2020 after 12 years at the website, and he now works for YouTube. Caldwell worked for iMore between 2014 and 2018, and she now works at Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRitchie was an especially prominent voice at iMore, having published numerous op-eds about Apple products over his years at the website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niMore had a dedicated team of writers in more recent years, including Lynch, Stephen Warwick, Joe Wituschek, Oliver Haslam, Tammy Rogers, John-Anthony Disotto, Daryl Baxter, James Bentley, Karen Freeman, and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom one Apple blog to another, we wish the iMore team past and present all the best.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-blog-imore-shutting-down/\">Apple Blog iMore Shutting Down: 'One More Thing… Goodbye'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-blog-imore-shutting-down-one-more-thing…-goodbye.2438231/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5985c062423d3499e3809b9c3ba7f89e67995deb47e256ecc9ba057ac225c29d","category":"Apple"}
