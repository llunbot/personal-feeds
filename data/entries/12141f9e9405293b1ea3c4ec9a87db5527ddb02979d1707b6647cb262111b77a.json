Unfortunately for its creators at Blizzard and developers at Vicarious Visions, the answer isn't \"the game.\"</p>\n<p>We have to hash some other stuff out first, and I appreciate your patience with this, because no review of <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em> (now live for $40 on <a href=\"https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo_ii_resurrected\">PC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/games/diablo-2-resurrected\">Xbox</a>, <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10000309/\">PlayStation</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/diablo-ii-resurrected-switch/\">Nintendo Switch</a>) is complete without an explainer like this at the outset. (Should you not need the refresher on Activision Blizzard's recent woes, skip to the section titled \"Delivering good work in a bad era\" and start there.)</p>\n<p>In the years after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/diablo/\"><em>Diablo</em></a>'s early '00s heyday, its creators at Blizzard racked up some infamy. In late 2019, the decades-old game developer <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/blizzard-bans-pro-hearthstone-gamer-for-statement-supporting-hong-kong/\">capitulated to the Chinese government over pro-Hong Kong statements</a> made by esports players (though thankfully, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-reinstates-hong-kong-protestors-prize-says-china-had-no-influence/\">the decision was reversed</a> soon after). Months later, Blizzard shipped <em>WarCraft III: Reforged</em>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-not-the-flavor-of-chaos-we-were-hoping-for/\">which did not meet the publisher's usual standards</a> (especially because <em>WC3R</em>Â wiped out the previous functioning game in favor of a broken, feature-incomplete client). Worse, since <em>WC3R</em>'s launch, months of agonizing silence about any updates and promised features have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-tops-our-list-of-2020s-most-disappointing-video-games/\">spoken volumes about Blizzard's apparent lack of plans for the game</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797098#p3\">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797098&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"12141f9e9405293b1ea3c4ec9a87db5527ddb02979d1707b6647cb262111b77a","category":"Tech"}
