{"title":"Austin Mann’s iPhone 16 Pro Camera Review: Kenya","link":"https://www.austinmann.com/trek/iphone-16-pro-camera-review-kenya","date":1726859915000,"content":"\n<p>Austin Mann:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Over the past week we’ve traveled over a thousand kilometers\nacross Kenya, capturing more than 10,000 photos and logging over\n3TB of ProRes footage with the new iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro\nMax cameras. Along the way, we’ve gained valuable insights into\nthese camera systems and their features. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The moment I learned about it, I knew exactly how I wanted to test\nit: a photo shoot with Craig.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago, my friend Bobby Neptune introduced me to Craig,\none of the last remaining super tusker elephants roaming the\nearth. He is unique not only because of his enormous tusks, but\nalso because of his extremely gentle demeanor and his curious\nhabit of often approaching safari cruisers. I knew if we were\nlucky enough to find him, it might be a great opportunity to put\nthe new Ultra Wide sensor to the test.</p>\n\n<p>Bobby got on the phone with David, a local maasai who tracks Craig\ndaily, and we met up with him to see if we could locate this\nbeautiful animal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had dinner with Mann and a few other photo-nerd <a href=\"https://sdw.space/\">friends</a> in California last week, after the Apple event, and when he told me his plan for Kenya — particularly his hope that they’d be able to find Craig — I crossed my fingers. What a magnificent animal.</p>\n\n<p>Absolutely stunning work — still and video — from Mann, too. Inspiring to know that this same camera is in my pocket every day.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/20/mann-iphone-16-pro-kenya\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4a49aa44815861bc2e129e3ddd76d78c486a2b97914ec3abea43894d95947962","category":"Tech"}
