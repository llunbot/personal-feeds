But one of the game's \"forward\" steps was anything but, at least on PCâ€”it adopted the then-new Games For Windows Live (GFWL) service.</p>\n<p>This week, that situation changes with the game's first official patch on PC in <a href=\"https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_patches\">12 years</a>. The patch is designed to do only one thing: remove all <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/12/games-for-windows-live-standalone-client-is-live/\">GFWL</a> dependencies.</p>\n<p>The 5.4MB patch for the game's Steam version went live on Tuesday and was accompanied by <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/22370?emclan=103582791433474067&amp;emgid=2993196769824312887\">a brief patch note</a> that merely states, \"If <em>Fallout 3</em> was previously installed on Steam, we suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the title.\" Anecdotal reports suggest that any <em>Fallout 3</em> fans who still have the PC version installed via Steam will need to do just that, as the patching process may stop the game from booting.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803407#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803407&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66927c9c27c1507aefd5b37f9767f0d2edef8bc025c16a0f581dc8eead135cea","category":"Tech"}
