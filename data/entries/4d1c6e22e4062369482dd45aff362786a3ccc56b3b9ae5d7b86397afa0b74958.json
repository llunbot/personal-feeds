Once, it was the beloved brand for the environmentally aware car buyer; more than that, it was the hottest thing in town. Hundreds of thousands of fans paid thousand-dollar <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/03/tesla-model-3-reservations-begin-march-31-how-to-be-near-the-top-of-the-list/\">deposits</a> and then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/tesla-opens-orders-to-all-us-and-canadian-model-3-reservation-holders/\">waited for up to two years</a> for a chance to buy a Model 3, with others paying hefty markups to people at the front of the queue. Back then, of course, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed to care about climate changeâ€”now he seems <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-says-elon-musk-will-lead-doge-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency/\">more likely to be found</a> helping to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-epa-is-scrapping-fuel-economy-regs-claiming-it-will-bring-back-us-jobs/\">undo</a> work on climate change.</p>\n<p>That has hurt Tesla's new car sales, which have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/tesla-sales-plummet-in-the-uk-france-and-germany/\">cratered in Europe</a> and declined to a lesser degree in China (where Musk's political activities have less bearing, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/tesla-china-sales-elon-musk.html\">and decline is more</a> stiff competition from local brands and the lack of a real model range). It has dented the reality-distortion field that surrounds the company's share price, if perhaps only to where it was six months ago. And it has also affected the prices of used Teslas here in the US.</p>\n<p>Being a Tesla driver is starting to carry some stigma, and owners are unused to the opprobrium they are now facing for their choice of electric vehicle. \"Two weeks ago, I was called a Nazi in the parking lot at Kroger,\" one owner <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html\">told The New York Times</a>. The YouTuber Vegas Tesla Family just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucaWBp8-Uxs\">posted a video</a> explaining that he was selling his Tesla \"because of Elon Musk.\" And more than one Ars commenter has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better.1505721/page-4#post-43524965\">sold their Tesla</a> in recent weeks as a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/tesla-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade.1504837/page-2#post-43401311\">direct result of Musk</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/used-tesla-prices-tumble-as-embarrassed-owners-look-to-sell/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/used-tesla-prices-tumble-as-embarrassed-owners-look-to-sell/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
