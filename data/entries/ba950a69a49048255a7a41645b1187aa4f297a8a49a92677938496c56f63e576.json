This is one of a pair of major policy initiatives from the Biden administration and congressional Democrats—the other being the Build Back Better Act, which (hopefully) includes, among other things, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/house-infrastructure-bill-includes-new-tax-credits-for-new-and-used-evs/\">expanded subsidies for electric cars and bikes</a> but which is still being obstructed <a href=\"https://www.accountable.us/news/report-in-q3-manchin-and-sinema-banked-additional-130000-from-anti-build-back-better-corporate-interests/\">by special interests in the Senate</a>.</p>\n<p>This bill should be signed by US President Joe Biden once Congress gets done with a week's holiday. Although it is very much scaled back from earlier proposals, it still includes $550 billion of new spending. Much of it is transport-related, including $40 billion to repair, replace, and rehabilitate bridges, $39 billion for mass transit modernization and expansion, and $66 billion for passenger and freight rail.</p>\n<p>The infrastructure bill also includes plenty of safety-related sections—no bad thing considering <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/traffic-deaths-climb-higher-than-miles-traveled-in-2021-nhtsa-finds/\">the ever-worsening death toll on US roads each year</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811228#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811228&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
