Riding a single-speed bike is cycling at its most stripped back. Because they do without multiple gears, single-speed bikes require little maintenance, which makes them great for everyday use. But besides minimal servicing costs, why would you ride one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single-speed or fixed gear forces you to work hard uphill and, in the latter case, spin quickly back down too (a fixie doesn’t allow you to freewheel at all). The benefits or lack thereof are hotly debated, but it’s safe to say they can make you a stronger rider, and you’ll certainly learn some new techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On flatter terrain, their reduced weight (compared to an equivalent geared bike) and robustness make single-speeds ideal partners for commuting. With no changing gear to think about, they’re enormous fun to ride too, while many riders are attracted by the minimalist aesthetics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Single-speeds have fewer total parts than standard bikes so you can sometimes get more bike for less money, yet despite their simplicity, there is a broad range of options catering to many different niches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8 of the best single-speed bikes at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>B’Twin 500 City: RRP £249.99 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fcity-bike-single-speed-500%2F_%2FR-p-306292\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon (£229.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Steed Thoroughbred: RRP £475 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://steedbikes.com/collections/thoroughbred-fixie-single-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Steed Bikes (£450)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quella Varsity Collection: RRP £529 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.quellabicycle.com/shop/premium-varsity-collection-edinburgh/\" target=\"_blank\">Quella (£529)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>BLB Viper Comp: RRP £879 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.bricklanebikes.co.uk/blb-viper-complete-bike-comp\" target=\"_blank\">Brick Lane Bikes (£879)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Genesis Flyer: RRP £699.99 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20283&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fgenesis-flyer-vargn21250\" target=\"_blank\">Freewheel (£699.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Orro FE: RRP £699.99 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://winstanleysbikes.co.uk/orro-fe-street-2023-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Winstanleys Bikes (£599.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Condor Classico Pista: RRP £1,199.99 – Buy now from<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Fcondor-classico-pista-frameset%3Fvariant%3D48573359946\" target=\"_blank\"> Condor (£1,199.99 frameset)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bombtrack Arise 2: RRP £1,270 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.bikester.co.uk/bombtrack-arise-M902245.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bikester (£959)</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust <em>Cyclist</em>‘s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We ride every sort of bike, not just top-end road bikes but also gravel bikes and many of us have a fixie in our sheds as well.

Fixies are technically single-speed bikes too but the lack of a freewheel means that if the bike is in motion, your legs must be turning, and you can exercise some control over your speed without touching your brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikes ridden on the track (ie, in a velodrome) are always fixed-gear, however this style of bike is also very popular for general urban riding and commuting, and there are loads of options on the market for city-friendly fixies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a learning curve to riding fixed as you need to train your brain to <em>never </em>stop pedalling. Many riders enjoy the experience and the feeling of direct connection to the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laws vary by country, but in the UK a fixie needs just one (front) brake, as the direct connection to the rear wheel counts as your second brake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There does persist a fashion for riding fixies with no brakes at all, however we strongly advise against this as – legal implications aside – physics dictate you simply can’t stop as quickly without a front brake.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I buy a fixie? (Or a single-speed?)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! Practical advantages aside, fixies in particular are a huge amount of fun. Riding fixed adds a new dimension to cycling and we’d recommend anyone gives it a try. Even if pure fixed isn’t for you, single-speed bikes have a lot to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wouldn’t necessarily choose fixed or single-speed for all of our riding – we love <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">road bikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a> and every other sort of bike too – but for zipping around a city day-to-day, they come highly recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Need some help with technical terms?
