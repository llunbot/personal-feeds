As the incident occurred outside of 3 km to go, the pair – and others similarly caught up – were not given bunch time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates crossed the line 31 seconds behind stage winner Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Fenix) while Carthy was another seven seconds behind in a large group that also included Jack Haig (Bahrain-Victorious). Neither Yates nor Carthy appeared to be hurt in the incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates now sits 56th overall, 51 seconds behind stage 1 winner, overall leader, and two-time defending champion, Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma). Carthy, who finished third overall at last year’s Vuelta, is at 1:11 behind Roglič, in 76th place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bora-Hansgrohe was the team most affected by the late crash on stage 2. Three of the German team’s riders hit the tarmac: Max Schachmann, Patrick Gamper, and Jordi Meeus. “Max and Jordi do not seem to have any injuries,” a team press release explained. “Patrick, who sustained a cut, is at the hospital with our team doctor for further examinations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates and Carthy, meanwhile, will have the opportunity to move back up the GC on Monday’s stage 3 which features the Vuelta’s first uphill finish: the 7.6 km ascent of Picón Blanco, with a tough average gradient of more than 9%.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/yates-and-carthy-lose-time-after-being-caught-behind-late-vuelta-crash/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c9649a9b2679ff87eeb94678b939ec613c63aa9e9c35a9a2b3faa0f75d602243","category":"Cycling"}
