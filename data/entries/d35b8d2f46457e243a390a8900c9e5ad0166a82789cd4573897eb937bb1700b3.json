Following the release of iOS 17.2 last week, some users have complained about a bug that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/akhimohammed1/status/1736641886746562922\">causes the Messages app to disappear</a> when rearranging app icons on the Home Screen, but it is unclear if iOS 17.2.1 would address this issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven there are multiple holidays over the next few weeks, it is possible that iOS 17.2.1 will not be released until next month, although the update could be expedited if there are critical fixes. There was no iOS 16.2.1 update for precedent, but Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/ios-15-2-1-homekit-vulnerability-fix/\">released iOS 15.2.1</a> with a HomeKit security fix in mid-January in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2.1 would be a stopgap while Apple continues to test a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-1/\">larger iOS 17.3 update</a>, which features a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/\">new Stolen Device Protection security option</a> and re-enables the ability to create <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/\">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-preparing-ios-17-2-1/\">Apple Preparing iOS 17.2.1 Update for iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-ios-17-2-1-update-for-iphone.2414112/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d35b8d2f46457e243a390a8900c9e5ad0166a82789cd4573897eb937bb1700b3","category":"Apple"}
