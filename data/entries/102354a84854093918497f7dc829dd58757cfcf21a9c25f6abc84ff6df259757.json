Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>Between a new platform and the model's first hybrid powertrain, the redesigned 2024 Toyota Tacoma is full of interesting tidbits and both off- and on-road enhancements. The refresh has been a long time coming, as the last time Toyota updated the Tacoma was for model-year 2015.</p>\n<p>The Tacoma line began in 1995 as a US-specific version of the global HiLux. Even <em>Back to the Future</em>'s Marty McFly coveted a black 1985 Toyota HiLux SR5 Xtra Cab, and it appeared in his garage, complete with a kangaroo bar, off-roading lights, and more.</p>\n<p>By design, the new Tacoma is larger than the last generation, sharing a platform with the full-size Tundra. Today, the 2024 Tacoma is more fuel-efficient than its smaller predecessor, notching between 20 and 26 mpg (9–11.8 L/100 km) in the gas-powered versions—a 1995 HiLux ranged from 14–22 mpg (10.7–16.8 L/100 km). We're waiting to see what the hybrid powertrain earns from the EPA; the difference in mpg may be modest, but the horsepower quotient is impressive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991756#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991756&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"102354a84854093918497f7dc829dd58757cfcf21a9c25f6abc84ff6df259757","category":"Tech"}
