The redesigned Sanction 2s feature select technology borrowed from Bell’s range-topping Full 10, but sits at the opposite end of the price range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In designing the new Sanction 2s Bell focused on providing a good fit, breathability, and offering good value. Both the new Sanction 2 and Sanction 2 DLX are ASTM certified for DH and BMX racing, and the base model comes in an XXS size for younger shredders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sanction 2 DLX</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-angle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"775\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-angle-800x775.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-angle-800x775.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-angle-297x288.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-angle-120x116.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-angle-768x744.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-angle.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The redesigned Sanction 2 DLX features an ABS shell and an EPS liner. The new shell has a sleek, fully updated design with a nicer overall look than the outgoing Sanction full face (especially the chin bar and front vent, IMHO). Bell says the Sanction helmets’ face opening allows for good compatibility with goggles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-rear.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"981\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-rear-800x981.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-rear-800x981.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-rear-245x300.jpg 245w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-rear-98x120.jpg 98w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-rear-768x941.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-rear.jpg 979w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep air flowing freely, the Sanction 2 DLX boasts 14 vents and Bell’s Ventilated DH Air padding. While you can see the rear ventilation was inspired by the top-tier Full 10 helmet, the Sanction 2 DLX doesn’t offer the same huge rear vents. It does appear the smaller rear/side vents follow the same principle of drawing air out of the back of the helmet (this design proved very effective in the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unique-vents-give-the-new-bell-full-10-spherical-dh-helmet-impressive-ventilation/\">Full 10</a> I tested last year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sanction 2 DLX comes with MIPS Essential (which is the ‘standard’ MIPS system with the visible yellow slip-plane liner) to reduce rotational forces in a crash.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DLX-visor.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The DLX also includes a Fidlock magnetic chin buckle and an Adjustable Flying Bridge visor. The visor is shaped to aid airflow through the helmet, and designed to flex to help manage energy in an impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features of the DLX model include quick-drying Ionic+ antimicrobial padding with silver metalized yarn to fight odor buildup, and removable cheek pads (intended for easy washing; they’re not the emergency pull-out type).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A size medium Sanction 2 DLX weighs a claimed 1080g. They are available in seven colorways/graphics, and in sizes XS/S, M, L, and XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sanction 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-black-side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-black-side-800x649.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-black-side-800x649.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-black-side-297x241.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-black-side-120x97.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-black-side-768x623.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-black-side.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The base model Sanction 2 offers the same ABS shell and EPS liner as the DLX, with the same Ventilated DH Air padding and removable/washable cheek pads, however, the padding is not Ionic+. The base model includes Bell’s Adjustable Flying Bridge visor but does not get the MIPS Essential liner and uses a traditional chin buckle instead of a Fidlock.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-green-top.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Good news for younger and smaller riders; the Sanction 2 is available in an XXS size (in select colors), fitting heads as small as 48cm, and certified for anyone aged five and up. Without the MIPS liner, the Sanction 2 weighs slightly less than the DLX model at 1040g for a size medium. The Sanction 2 is available in five colors, and the same sizes as the DLX (plus the select XXS options).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-Sanction-2-DH-shot.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Images c.

Both models are now available online and at Bell retailers across the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bell is planning to send me both models of the Sanction 2 helmets for testing, so keep an eye on Bikerumor for a comparative review later this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.bellhelmets.com/\">bellhelmets.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bell-sanction-2-affordable-full-face-helmet-mtb-bmx/\">Bell Sanction 2 Full-Face Helmets Offer Affordable Protection for MTB or BMX</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6fc9daef0d6ad8dbf380d3f1300ccb724d6ecb195050d5877348e7d06f49d9e4","category":"Cycling"}
