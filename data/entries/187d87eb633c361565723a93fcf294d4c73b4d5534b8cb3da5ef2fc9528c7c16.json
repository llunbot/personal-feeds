It sort of makes sense, right? If you’re opening your MacBook, you’re probably going to use it, so it should turn on. (As for plugging it in, I’m unsure what the thinking is by Apple to have the MacBook automatically turn on.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, what if you want to be able to open it or plug it in without it turning on? With macOS Sequoia, you can now adjust your MacBook so it <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120622\">does not turn on when you open it or plug in the adapter</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To change this setting, you need to enter commands through the Terminal app, which is located in <em>Applications</em> &gt; <em>Utilities</em>. After launching Terminal, enter one of these commands:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to open the MacBook or connect to power with the laptop turning on type the following: <code>sudo nvram BootPreference=%00</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>To stop the MacBook from turning on only when opening it, type the following: <code>sudo nvram BootPreference=%01</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>To stop the MacBook from turning on when only connecting to power, type the following: <code>sudo nvram BootPreference=%02</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After typing the command, press the Return key. You’ll need to enter your password; when you do, you will not see it being typed on the screen. Press Return, and you’re set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to reset the feature and want to have your MacBook turn on when you open it or plug it in, launch Terminal and enter <code>sudo nvram -d BootPreference</code> and then press the Return key. Your Mac will then return to the default function of turning on when you open the lid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on using your MacBook with an external display, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673295/how-to-use-macbook-with-lid-closed-stop-closed-mac-sleeping.html\">here’s how to stop your MacBook from sleeping when the lid is closed</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"187d87eb633c361565723a93fcf294d4c73b4d5534b8cb3da5ef2fc9528c7c16","category":"Apple"}
