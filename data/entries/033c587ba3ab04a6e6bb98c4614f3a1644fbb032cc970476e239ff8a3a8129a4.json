Apple has frequently invited the media to hands-on briefings <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1782792088310206713\">in New York City</a>, and it also held a briefing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rsgnl/status/1765006539981484402\">in Toronto, Canada</a> for the new MacBook Air models last month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's \"Let Loose\" event begins on Tuesday, May 7 at 7 a.m. Pacific Time, which will be 3 p.m. local time in London. New devices and accessories expected to be announced at the event include two new iPad Pro models, two new iPad Air models, an updated Apple Pencil, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads, and there is always a chance of a surprise or two. A video stream of the event will be available <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">on Apple.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo\">on YouTube</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has repeatedly said that he expects Apple to launch its Vision Pro headset in additional countries <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/\">before its developers conference WWDC</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/\">begins June 10</a>. Could the accompanying \"event\" in London allow journalists in the UK to receive hands-on time with the Vision Pro too? It could make sense for Apple to launch the Vision Pro internationally before it announces visionOS 2 at WWDC, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/vision-pro-keyboard-new-languages/\">UK is one of nine countries</a> where the headset is expected to become available next.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, this is all just some pre-event speculation for fun based on a single sentence in a British newspaper. Apple's actual plans remain to be seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> We have confirmed that Apple has invited journalists and well-known social media content creators from Europe and abroad to an in-person gathering at its Battersea campus in London. This will be a multi-day function that begins on the same day as the \"Let Loose\" event, and the media will receive product briefings.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/\">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-let-loose-event-london/\">Apple Event Next Month Said to Be 'Accompanied By an Event in London'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-event-next-month-said-to-be-accompanied-by-an-event-in-london.2424983/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"033c587ba3ab04a6e6bb98c4614f3a1644fbb032cc970476e239ff8a3a8129a4","category":"Apple"}
