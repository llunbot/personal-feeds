The Beats Studio Pro name was found by @aaronp613.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/g6wWeKbRaX\">pic.twitter.com/g6wWeKbRaX</a></p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1656011361858535426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nBased on the name, the Beats Studio Pro will be a new version of the current Beats Studio3 headphones. The Beats Studio3 are several years old at this point, and there have been no new Beats-branded over-ear headphones launched since 2017.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple appears to be developing the Beats Studio Pro headphones in collaboration with Samuel Ross of A-Cold-Wall. The design looks to be largely identical to the Beats Studio3 headphones, but Apple will likely add internal improvements to justify the \"Pro\" moniker. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere could be an updated Apple-designed chip, as the Studio3 continue to use the old W1 chip, along with improved Active Noise Cancellation and the addition of a Transparency Mode. Apple also plans to add \"Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>\" support, a feature that is not available in the current Studio3 headphones. The new Beats Studio Pro headphones will likely see a launch later in the year as new Beats often show up in iOS and macOS weeks or months ahead of launch.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/09/apple-working-on-new-beats-studio-pro/\">Apple Working on New Beats Studio Pro Headphones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-new-beats-studio-pro-headphones.2389117/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"459229ead6a81e050255eb032b82e4ef88a5c0abaf74cce470f11c62efcb3c49","category":"Apple"}
