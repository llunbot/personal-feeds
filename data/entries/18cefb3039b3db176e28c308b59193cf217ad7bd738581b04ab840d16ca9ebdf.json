A large handle makes it easy to pump, and their standout feature -a magnetic hose- hides inside the barrel until you need it. Then just slide it out, click (er, Klic) it onto the pump and start inflating.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2153\" height=\"1380\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1.jpg\" alt=\"crank brothers klic mini floor pump fits in hydration packs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1.jpg 2153w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1-297x190.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1-800x513.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1-768x492.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1-1536x985.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-klic-mini-floor-pump-1-2048x1313.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pump head has a full size lever, no threading it on and accidentally twisting out the valve core when removing it. One of the coolest features of the design is that you can pull the hose off the pump and the air won’t come out of the tire…so you can attach the hose to your wheel first, then click it onto the pump and inflate, then pull the pump away and grab the hose. Sounds like a little thing, but it’s a big reason to love their Klic lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $69.99, available in silver only, works with Presta and Schrader, and inflates comfortably up to 60psi (claimed max is 110psi, but really…). Weight is 171g, length is 325mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1.jpg\" alt=\"crank brothers highline dropper post remote with 360 degree swivel mount and infinite angle adjust\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1-297x96.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1-800x258.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1-120x39.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1-768x248.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-post-remote-gen2-1-1536x495.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 2023 <a href=\"https://www.crankbrothers.com/collections/new/products/highline-premium-remote-gen-2\" target=\"_blank\">Highline Premium Dropper Post Remote</a> is their 2nd generation effort and gets an infinitely rotatable spherical mount. This lets you change the angle of it’s static starting position both fore/aft and up/down, and even rotate it, to achieve the optimum ergonomics for your opposable digit. You can even spin the lever all the way around and put it on the right side of the bar, above the bar…whatever…letting you work around remote suspension lockouts levers, etc. You’ve got options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest version has a revised paddle shape with grippy silicone pad, lateral adjustments on the mounting connection (great for working around other things bolted to your handlebar…like brake levers), and lighter actuation than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"710\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1.jpg\" alt=\"replacement thumb pads for crank brothers highline dropper post remote with six colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1-297x117.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1-800x316.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1-120x47.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1-768x303.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crank-brothers-highline-dropper-remote-thumb-pad-colors-1-1536x606.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all locked into place with a single bolt, too, making those adjustments super easy. It’s available in three versions – I-Spec EV, Universal, and MMX Matchmaker, each running $69.99. A built-in barrel adjuster makes it easy to fine tune cable tension, too. Compatible with their Highline dropper posts and most other brands’ posts, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to customize more than the position? Choose from one of six <a href=\"https://www.crankbrothers.com/collections/new/products/highline-rubber-pad\" target=\"_blank\">thumb pad colors</a> -blue, turquoise, gray, purple, orange, or red- for $9.99 each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crankbrothers.com\" target=\"_blank\">CrankBrothers.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crank-brothers-pushes-a-spherical-dropper-remote-pack-friendly-floor-pump/\">Crank Brothers Pushes a Spherical Dropper Remote &amp; Pack-Friendly Floor Pump</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"18cefb3039b3db176e28c308b59193cf217ad7bd738581b04ab840d16ca9ebdf","category":"Cycling"}
