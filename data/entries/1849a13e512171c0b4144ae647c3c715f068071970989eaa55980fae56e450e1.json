In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/\">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. May's list includes a nifty experiment to make a predicted effect of special relativity visible; a ping-pong playing robot that can return hits with 88 percent accuracy; and the discovery of the rare genetic mutation that makes orange cats orange, among other highlights.</p>\n<h2>Special relativity made visible</h2>\n<p><img width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Low-Res_TerrellPenrose-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"The Terrell-Penrose-Effect: Fast objects appear rotated\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Low-Res_TerrellPenrose-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Low-Res_TerrellPenrose.jpg 700w\" />\n        Credit:\n          TU Wien\n      </p>\n<p>Perhaps the most well-known feature of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity is time dilation and length contraction. In 1959, two physicists predicted another feature of relativistic motion: An object moving near the speed of light should also appear to be rotated. It has not been possible to demonstrate this experimentally, howeverâ€”until now. Physicists at the Vienna University of Technology figured out how to reproduce this rotational effect in the lab using laser pulses and precision cameras, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02003-6\">a paper</a> published in the journal Communications Physics.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/research-roundup-ping-pong-bots-the-genetic-key-for-ginger-cats-and-more/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/research-roundup-ping-pong-bots-the-genetic-key-for-ginger-cats-and-more/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1849a13e512171c0b4144ae647c3c715f068071970989eaa55980fae56e450e1","category":"Tech"}
