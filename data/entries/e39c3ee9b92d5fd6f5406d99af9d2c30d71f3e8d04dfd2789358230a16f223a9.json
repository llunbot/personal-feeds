Campy could say they had been making drivetrains since before there were paved roads. Well, Matera could say they’ve been inhabited since before gravel roads or even wheels. (<em>That happened 4-5 millennia BC, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_road_transport\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Officina-Battaglin-Matera-modern-steel-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_head-badge.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Officina-Battaglin-Matera-modern-steel-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_head-badge.webp\" alt=\"Officina Battaglin Matera modern steel gravel bike made-in-Italy, headtube detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Officina-Battaglin-Matera-modern-steel-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_head-badge.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Officina-Battaglin-Matera-modern-steel-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_head-badge-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Officina-Battaglin-Matera-modern-steel-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_head-badge-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Officina-Battaglin-Matera-modern-steel-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_head-badge-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Officina-Battaglin-Matera-modern-steel-gravel-bike-made-in-Italy_head-badge-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s an almost philosophical connection between Matera’s ancient stone dwellings, etched directly into the limestone, and a steel frame handmade in Italy. Just as Matera has withstood the test of time, handcrafted steel frames have maintained their special place in cycling despite newer materials coming and going. We’ve created a bike that connects riders to the terrain in the same way Matera’s ancient structures connect to the landscape – through harmony, not domination.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Giovanni Battaglin, Officina Battaglin founder and double 1981 Giro d’Italia &amp;
