Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, the reporter says the iPhone 17 Pro won't have a two-toned back, as some renders have depicted. \"The camera area will be the same color as the rest of the device,\" he says.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Some images online even show a two-tone design, with a dark-black camera block on top of a silver iPhone back. Those are, like many renders on the internet, not an accurate representation of what's to come.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 17 Pro won't have a two-toned back, I'm told. The camera area will be the same color as the rest of the device. </blockquote>In this sense, apart from the new Google Pixel-esque camera module, the iPhone 17 Pro \"won't a major departure from current models,\" reckons Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em>The Information</em>, Apple has chosen a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">half glass, half aluminum build</a> for its iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max to increase durability. The glass will allow wireless charging to continue to be available, while a partial aluminum frame will be less prone to breakage. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis year's iPhone 17 series will also include a new ultra-slim iPhone 17 \"Air\" model that replaces the Plus device in the lineup. The new models are expected to be announced in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/\">iPhone 17 Pro's New Rear Camera Bar 'Same Color As Rest of Device'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pros-new-rear-camera-bar-same-color-as-rest-of-device.2454869/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"38da8fe05eab3950c78e40861d020b561c14ddf817a581d2b8083847c35f6e5e","category":"Apple"}
