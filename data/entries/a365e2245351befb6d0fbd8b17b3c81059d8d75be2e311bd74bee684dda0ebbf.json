Immune cells like <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-b-cells-and-t-cells-explained-141888\">T cells</a> do this by distinguishing between different types of proteins within cells, which allows them to detect the presence of infection or disease.</p>\n<p>A type of T cell called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-020-01048-4\">cytotoxic T cells</a> can recognize the mutated proteins on cancer cells and should therefore be able to kill them. However, in most patients, cancer cells grow unchecked despite the presence of T cells.</p>\n<p>The current explanation scientists have as to why T cells fail to eliminate cancer cells is because <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-019-0221-9\">they become “exhausted.”</a> The idea is that T cells initially function well when they first face off against cancer cells, but gradually lose their ability to kill the cancer cells after repeated encounters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959111#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959111&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a365e2245351befb6d0fbd8b17b3c81059d8d75be2e311bd74bee684dda0ebbf","category":"Tech"}
