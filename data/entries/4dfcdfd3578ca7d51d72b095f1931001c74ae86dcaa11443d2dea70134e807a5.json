A major sponsor, who had initially committed to a three-year partnership, has had to withdraw their support unexpectedly. This sudden loss of funding has left us in a precarious position, jeopardizing the programs and opportunities we provide to our youth and community.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?fit=1200,1708&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/LABA-6-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The impact of this unexpected turn of events cannot be overstated. Los Angeles Bicycle Academy has been an agent of hope and positive change for countless youth, offering not just the joy of cycling but also valuable life skills, mentorship, racing opportunities, skill development, and a sense of community.
