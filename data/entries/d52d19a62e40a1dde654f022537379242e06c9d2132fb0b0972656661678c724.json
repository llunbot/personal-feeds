{"title":"Apple Watch Series 9 Buyer's Guide: How Incremental Upgrades Stack Up Over the Years","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-generations-compared/","date":1695981443000,"content":"The Apple Watch has received some incremental updates in recent years, with significant upgrades becoming fewer and farther between as the device has progressed. Since the Apple Watch's generation-over-generation enhancements are relatively small, it is all the more important to consider when an upgrade is justified and whether an older model could suffice for your needs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s headline upgrade is the S9 chip, bringing improved performance to the Apple Watch for the first time in four years and facilitating features like Double Tap. It is priced starting at $399. Last year's Series 8 introduced body temperature sensing and Crash Detection, but the last moderately significant update for the device was 2021's Series 7, which introduced larger display sizes and fast-charging capability. All previous Apple Watch models from before the Series 9 have been discontinued, but older models may still be found for even lower prices from third-party retailers or second-hand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRead on to see the breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with each Apple Watch model compared to its direct predecessor. Viewing each generation's changes in this way helps weigh up the accumulative upgrades one receives by skipping multiple generations when buying a new device, as well as get a sense of which generations offered the biggest overall upgrades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Apple Watch Series 9 (2023)</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>Retina display with up to 2,000 nits of brightness</li>\r<br

If you have an Apple Watch Series 6 or older, upgrading to the ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ will generally be worthwhile, with plenty of new features across the board. Discounted Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 models are also a good option for those coming from a Series 6 or older if you are looking to save money.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/\">considered moving</a> the Apple Watch away from an annual upgrade cycle to offer more substantial updates less frequently. Next year's Apple Watch \"Series X\" is rumored to be a significant update to mark the tenth anniversary of the device, featuring thinner casings, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/\">larger displays</a>, microLED technology, larger batteries, blood pressure monitoring, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/\">new mechanism</a> for connecting bands.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-generations-compared/\">Apple Watch Series 9 Buyer's Guide: How Incremental Upgrades Stack Up Over the Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-buyers-guide-how-incremental-upgrades-stack-up-over-the-years.2405453/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d52d19a62e40a1dde654f022537379242e06c9d2132fb0b0972656661678c724","category":"Apple"}
