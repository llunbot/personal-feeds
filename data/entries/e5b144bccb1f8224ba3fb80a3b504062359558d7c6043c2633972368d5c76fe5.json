The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court yesterday.</p>\n<p>Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before arriving, sent a threatening message that said, \"if I can't have you no one can.\" He also allegedly threatened to send nude photos of the victim to her family members.</p>\n<p>Glauner was charged yesterday with stalking and fraud \"in connection with obtaining confidential phone records\" in US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. We aren't posting or linking directly to the court record because it seems to contain the victim's home address.
