After a report on Tuesday claimed the “Scary Fast” event will focus on the MacBook Pro, we now have what looks like the first real-world look at the new machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the box anyway. According to a Weibo post shared by ShrimpApplePro on X (formerly Twitter), the new MacBook Pro will look extremely similar to the current model, with skinny bezels, rounded corners, and circular feet. As usual, the front of the box has no other markings to identify the model or year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I guess this is the new MacBook Pro <br />Source: Weibo <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/tdppFixOgJ&amp;xcust=1-1-2115851-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/tdppFixOgJ</a></p>— ShrimpApplePro ðŸ¤ (@VNchocoTaco) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1717105054287826967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2115851-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">October 25, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wallpaper shows off a dark background with glowing lines snaking throughout the screen. If real, it’s a departure from the colorful wallpapers Apple used with the M1 and M2 MacBook Pros. The color palette and aesthetic are similar to the iPhone 15 Pro’s muted wallpaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The box shows a MacBook Pro in silver, though Space Gray is also expected. It’s not clear which size model is shown or whether the new model still has a notch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the outside of the MacBook Pro is expected to stay the same, the inside will have a new M3 chip as well as a few other enhancements. Apple will likely unveil the new machine during its ‘Scary Fast’ event on October 30 at 5 p.m. PT.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"537479d77ab546970357e8b28c8a96d88ad8fb56511785709eb0f3701596add2","category":"Apple"}
