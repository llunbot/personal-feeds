Its wheel range extends from DH to TT.</p>\n<p>Recently added to the line-up are alloy hoops, including these do-it-all Reserve 30|HD AL 6069 wheels.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, they have an internal width of 30mm – plenty broad enough for your trail-shredding 2.5in rubber, while the rims are constructed from a 6069 alloy.</p>\n<p>The rims aren’t overly deep, at 22mm, and they feature an asymmetric rim bed. This enables the spokes to have a more equilateral triangular shape as they travel from hub shell to rim, for a stiffer and stronger build.</p>\n<p>The rims come pre-taped, and in the box you’ll get a set of Reserve’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/reserve-fillmore-tubeless-valves/\">Fillmore valves</a>. I’ve been using these for a while and I’ve been impressed by their performance.</p>\n<p>The rims are joined to the hubs via 32 J-bend spokes and alloy nipples.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/reserve-fillmore-27f32fd.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Reserve Fillmore valve\" title=\"reserve fillmore\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Reserve’s excellent Fillmore valve comes as standard.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/reserve-hub-9f5d92f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"DT Swiss 350 hub\" title=\"reserve hub\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>DT Swiss’ 350 hubs sit in the middle of the wheels.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/reserve-offset-spoke-831cfb2.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Reserve wheels offset spoke bed\" title=\"reserve offset spoke\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Offset spokes are common these days, they allow better triangulation of the spokes.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/reserve-freehub-fb431a6.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"XD freehub\" title=\"reserve freehub\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>XD and Microspline freehubs are available.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Speaking of the hubs, they’re supplied by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/dt-swiss/\">DT Swiss</a>.
