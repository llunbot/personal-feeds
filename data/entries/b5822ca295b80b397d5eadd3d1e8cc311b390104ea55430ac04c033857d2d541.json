To build on that, Apple is talking with major studios about ways to complement its slate of original programming with films from other companies in order to expand and extend the service's appeal.</p>\n<p>That's <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/apple-is-in-talks-to-license-more-films-from-hollywood?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google\">according</a> to Bloomberg reporters Lucas Shaw and Thomas Buckley, who cite people familiar with Apple's workings.
