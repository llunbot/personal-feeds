May or June would align with that timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we recap three new features rumored for the AirTag 2:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>With a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, the AirTag 2 is expected to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/\">up to 3Ã— longer range</a> compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.
