(credit: <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Yesterday, Apple announced its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/apple-makes-the-iphone-13-official/\">new flagship iPhones</a>: the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max. But while Apple's announcement livestream was full of details, some things were left out.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we've learned a bit more from Apple's updated website, including dimensions and weight, some info about specs, and the lineup of older iPhone models that will survive the culling that follows the introduction of a new flagship.</p>\n<h2>Thicker and heavier</h2>\n<p>The new iPhones are heavier than their immediate predecessors, and they're a little thicker, too. For example, the iPhone 12 weighed 5.78 ounces, but the iPhone 13 weighs 6.14 ounces. The iPhone 12 Pro was 6.66 ounces, but the iPhone 13 Pro is 7.19 ounces. This holds up across the line. And the iPhone 13 is 0.25 mm thicker than the 12; similar thickness differences are also universal.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795569#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795569&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2de649ae1d500b638b518e44cd0fee9372af40fc4a88458596c5c91eb45b9c57","category":"Tech"}
