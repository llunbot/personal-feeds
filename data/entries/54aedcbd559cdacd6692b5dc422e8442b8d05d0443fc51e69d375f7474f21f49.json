If this speculation proves to be accurate, at least some iPhone 17 models could adopt the technology next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that TDDI technology would allow for Apple devices to have thinner OLED displays, through integration of the touch and display driver layers, the technology seems particularly fitting for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/\">rumored ultra-thin \"iPhone 17 Air.\"</a> \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt remains to be seen if Apple actually moves forward with adopting this technology. The report further speculated that Apple might first use it in lower-volume products compared to the iPhone, such as future iPad and Apple Watch models, and the technology would also be suitable for a long-rumored foldable iPhone or iPad.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/04/oled-tddi-iphones-rumor/\">Apple Predicted to Release iPhones With Thinner OLED Displays Next Year… iPhone 17 Air?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-predicted-to-release-iphones-with-thinner-oled-displays-next-year…-iphone-17-air.2439148/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"54aedcbd559cdacd6692b5dc422e8442b8d05d0443fc51e69d375f7474f21f49","category":"Apple"}
