You’ll also need the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-shorts/\">best </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-shorts/\">bib shorts</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-shorts/\">mountain bike shorts</a>, along with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-saddles/\">best road bike</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-mountain-bike-saddles/\">mountain bike saddle</a>.</p>\n<p>Even with chamois cream, shorts and saddle sorted, your backside may still be slightly sore after lots of riding.</p>\n<h3>How to apply chamois cream</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Chamois pad on bib shorts\" title=\"Chamois pad on bib shorts\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can apply chamois cream to the skin that will be in contact with the saddle or the seat pad in your shorts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudrey / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Start off with clean, dry hands. Where you’ll be applying the chamois cream should be clean too.</p>\n<p>You can apply chamois cream to the pad in your cycling shorts, but most people apply chamois cream to the area of skin in contact with the saddle.</p>\n<p>This includes the buttocks, above all the sit bones, and possibly the crotch. Women are not advised not to apply chamois cream internally.</p>\n<p>If you experience chafing in the groin area, you could use chamois cream on the inner leg too.</p>\n<p>Take a one- or two-fingered scoop out of the chamois cream tub.</p>\n<p>For hygiene reasons, don’t ‘double dip’ by taking another scoop with the hand you’ve used to rub in the cream.</p>\n<p>If you need more, wash your hands between applications.</p>\n<h3>Do you need to use chamois cream?</h3>\n<p>You don’t need to use chamois cream, but it can be advantageous to do so.</p>\n<p>Some riders cover long distances without ever needing it. Others think they benefit from using chamois cream even on short rides.</p>\n<p>Chafing can be worse when your bib short chamois gets wet with rain or sweat.</p>\n<p>The best chamois creams are claimed to be water- and sweat-resistant (look out for lanolin in the ingredients).</p>\n<p>This should help them reduce friction between your bib shorts, skin and saddle for longer before washing away.</p>\n<h3>Men’s vs women’s chamois cream</h3>\n<p>Some brands make women’s-specific chamois cream, which contains different ingredients from the men’s version.</p>\n<p>Men’s chamois cream often contains menthol. It has a cooling and tingling effect, which some women find uncomfortable if it happens to contact their genitalia.</p>\n<p>Not all men like the smell or sensation of menthol either.</p>\n<p>Women’s chamois creams often have a lower pH level, which is designed to reduce the risk of vaginal irritation and infection.</p>\n<p>Other companies’ chamois creams are unisex or not gender-specific.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"871704ee765b7fda8712e6fe8519c4ccf883593ba7a5ba6a855a71e702c0c110","category":"Cycling"}
