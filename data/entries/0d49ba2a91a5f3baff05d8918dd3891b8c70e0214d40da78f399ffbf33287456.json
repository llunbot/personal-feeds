Or, if you're at the Starbucks, you can have it surface your Starbucks Rewards number. Or your medical record number if you're at the doctor's office.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/1password-nearby.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nLocations can be assigned to a 1Password item by editing the item and choosing the new Add a Location option. 1Password says that like everything kept in the app, location information is not shared, stored, or tracked. Location information is checked locally, so current location coordinates are kept on-device at all times.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n1Password is priced at $2.99 per month for an individual plan, or $4.99 per month for a family plan (price requires purchasing a 12-month subscription). There are also business plans available.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/1password/\">1Password</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/1password-nearby-location/\">1Password Can Now Show You Codes and Logins Based on Your Location</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/1password-can-now-show-you-codes-and-logins-based-on-your-location.2452233/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d49ba2a91a5f3baff05d8918dd3891b8c70e0214d40da78f399ffbf33287456","category":"Apple"}
