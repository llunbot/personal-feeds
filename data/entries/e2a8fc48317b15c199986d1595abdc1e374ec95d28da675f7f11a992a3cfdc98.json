cyclist time trialling on BMC Speedmachine\" title=\"HERO_BMC_MY24_Speedmachine_01_main_action_-21\" />                                            <p>BMC has officially unveiled the Speedmachine time trial bike, which features a fork crown spoiler and an integrated hydration unit.</p>\n<p>BMC calls the Speedmachine the “fastest time trial and triathlon bike in the world”.</p>\n<p>The brand says the all-new bike is the fruit of a five-year collaboration with Formula 1 aerodynamic experts, Red Bull Advanced Technologies.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bmc-speedmachine/\">prototype Speedmachine</a> made its race debut at the 2022 Ironman World Championships.</p>\n<p>BMC-sponsored WorldTour teams have time trialled on a UCI-compliant version of the prototype this season.</p>\n<p>BMC says the Speedmachine is lighter and more stable than the outgoing Timemachine <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time trial bike</a>.</p>\n<p>The BMC Speedmachine will be available to buy from November 2023 as a frameset for $6,999/€6,999 and a full bike from $10,999/€10,999.</p>\n<h2>“World’s fastest”</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

Fin” fork crown spoiler is claimed to control air flowing off the front tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BMC</i></span></div>\n<p>Developed at BMC’s Impec research and development lab in Grenchen, Switzerland, the Speedmachine has deep, truncated aerofoil tube shapes and wide fork legs.</p>\n<p>BMC says a fork crown spoiler shaped like a shark fin diverts dirty air from the down tube and cutting drag.</p>\n<p>The head tube’s leading edge and wide fork have the same effect, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>The Swiss bike brand adds that the “Shark Fin” directly resulted from the partnership with Red Bull Advanced Technologies.</p>\n<p>This company performs aerodynamic modelling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations mainly for Formula One cars.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BMC Speedmachine time trial bike front-on\"

<i>BMC</i></span></div>\n<p>Since 2018 it has collaborated with BMC to apply its F1 expertise to bike racing.</p>\n<p>BMC says the Speedmachine’s simple frame comprises 20 parts, contributing to the frameset being 500g lighter than the Timemachine’s.</p>\n<p>A graph in the press material appears to show that the Speedmachine has a lower drag coefficient, a measure of aerodynamics, at various yaw angles than the Timemachine.</p>\n<p>All else being equal, this should make the Speedmachine faster on the road.</p>\n<p><span>But </span><span>BMC hasn’t supplied evidence demonstrating the Speedmachine is the “world’s fastest time trial and triathlon bike” by comparing it to competitors’ bikes. </span></p>\n<h2>More confident at speed</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

<i>BMC</i></span></div>\n<p>BMC says its Impec lab engineers made the Speedmachine’s geometry longer, taller and slacker than the Timemachine’s.</p>\n<p>The brand claims the Speedmachine’s handling is consequently more predictable and the rider is more confident at speed.</p>\n<p>Red Bull Advanced Technologies translated the concept of ‘Driver Feel’ – the way in which the driver feels connected to the car – to the Speedmachine, according to BMC.</p>\n<p>The BMC press material quotes AG2R Citroën’s Ben O’Connor as saying: “The main positive point is the manoeuvrability and stability, which are significantly improved, especially on the descents.”</p>\n<p>The Australian climber is also quoted as saying that the Speedmachine feels more “rigid and responsive” on ascents.</p>\n<div>\n    \n

integrates into the stem and standard riser blocks support the armrests and extensions.</p>\n<p>BMC now claims to offer riders more cockpit configurations with  base bar, extension and stack options.</p>\n<p>The Speedmachine is optimised for 28mm tyres but has clearance 30mm-wide rubber up from 27mm on the Timemachine, according to BMC.</p>\n<h3>BMC Speedmachine geometry</h3>\n<div>\n
