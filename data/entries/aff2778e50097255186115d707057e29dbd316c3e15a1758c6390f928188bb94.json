The study sparked a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/black-plastic-spatula-health-risks-6fddfdad?mod=e2tw\">flurry of media reports</a> a few weeks ago that urgently implored people to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/black-plastic-spatula-flame-retardants/680452/\">ditch their kitchen spatulas</a> and spoons. Wirecutter even offered a buying guide for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/toxic-black-plastic-kitchen-alternatives/\">what to replace them with</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352402811X\">The correction</a>, posted Sunday, will likely take some heat off the beleaguered utensils. The authors made a math error that put the estimated risk from kitchen utensils off by an order of magnitude.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the authors estimated that if a kitchen utensil contained middling levels of a key toxic flame retardant (BDE-209), the utensil would transfer 34,700 nanograms of the contaminant a day based on regular use while cooking and serving hot food. The authors then compared that estimate to a reference level of BDE-209 considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's safe level is 7,000 ng—per kilogram of body weight—per day, and the authors used 60 kg as the adult weight (about 132 pounds) for their estimate. So, the safe EPA limit would be 7,000 multiplied by 60, yielding 420,000 ng per day. That's 12 times more than the estimated exposure of 34,700 ng per day.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/huge-math-error-corrected-in-black-plastic-study-authors-say-it-doesnt-matter/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/huge-math-error-corrected-in-black-plastic-study-authors-say-it-doesnt-matter/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aff2778e50097255186115d707057e29dbd316c3e15a1758c6390f928188bb94","category":"Tech"}
