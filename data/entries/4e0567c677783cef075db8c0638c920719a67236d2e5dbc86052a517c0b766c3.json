Foxconn and Cowell Electronics are also said to be contributing camera parts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current iPhone 16 uses a rear 48-megapixel Wide Angle lens, which Apple refers to as a \"Fusion\" lens, so-called because of its ability to be used for both standard photos and cropped-in 2x zoom photos. The iPhone 16 also features a 12-megapixel TrueDepth camera on the front, suggesting the fourth-generation iPhone SE could include the same camera setup, just minus the additional Ultra Wide camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone SE 4 is rumored to have an all-display design similar to the iPhone 14, featuring Face ID instead of Touch ID, a 6.06-inch display, OLED display technology instead of LCD, a USB-C port, the iPhone 14 battery, 8GB RAM to support Apple Intelligence, and perhaps a multi-purpose Action button to replace the mute switch. The iPhone SE 4 is also expected to be the first device that is equipped with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/\">Apple-designed 5G chip</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced the existing third-generation iPhone SE on March 8, 2022, while the successor device could well debut around March 2025, according to reports.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/iphone-se-4-camera-details-revealed/\">iPhone SE 4 Said to Feature 48MP Rear Lens, 12MP TrueDepth Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-said-to-feature-48mp-rear-lens-12mp-truedepth-camera.2444951/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e0567c677783cef075db8c0638c920719a67236d2e5dbc86052a517c0b766c3","category":"Apple"}
