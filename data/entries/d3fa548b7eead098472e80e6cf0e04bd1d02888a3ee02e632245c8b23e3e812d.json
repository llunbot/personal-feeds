{"title":"A Few DF Sponsorship Openings","link":"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/","date":1745017830000,"content":"\n<p>Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">back in 2007</a>. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve got three openings left through the end of June:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>April 21–27 (next week)</li>\n<li>May 12–18</li>\n<li>May 26–June 1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, <a href=\"mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship\">get in touch</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/18/a-few-df-sponsorship-openings\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d3fa548b7eead098472e80e6cf0e04bd1d02888a3ee02e632245c8b23e3e812d","category":"Tech"}
