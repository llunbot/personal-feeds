(According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/kidnapped-father-french-crypto-millionaire-150730032.html?guccounter=1\">the BBC</a>, French police used \"phone signals\" to locate the house.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30dd511b4418a5d8cae1e428e5fbfcd6fe329dbb4e7170654ff12694b549413e","category":"Tech"}
