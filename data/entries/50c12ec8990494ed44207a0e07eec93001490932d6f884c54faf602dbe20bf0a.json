Wouldn’t it be great if we could teach clothes to capture, analyze, store, and communicate this important information in the form of valuable health and activity insights?”</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/finger-wrap-could-one-day-let-you-power-up-wearables-while-you-sleep/\">previously reported</a>, consumers scooped up more than 100 million units of such wearable devices as smartwatches, fitness trackers, augmented reality glasses, and similar tech in the first quarter of 2021 alone. Sales in the category increased 34.4 percent in the second quarter from Q2 2020, making it one of the fastest-growing categories of personal electronics. But while these devices do produce useful data, there are drawbacks. They can be heavy, uncomfortable when worn for long periods, and inaccurate since they usually only measure bodily signals from one spot (e.g., the wrist, chest, or finger).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/fiber-computer-woven-into-clothing-can-monitor-health/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/fiber-computer-woven-into-clothing-can-monitor-health/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"50c12ec8990494ed44207a0e07eec93001490932d6f884c54faf602dbe20bf0a","category":"Tech"}
