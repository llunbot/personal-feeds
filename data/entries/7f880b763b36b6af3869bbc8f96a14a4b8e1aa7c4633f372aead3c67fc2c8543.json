Sort of a hybrid between an industrial spin bike and a traditional bike, the Zwift Ride has everything you need for Zwifting and nothing else (like a front wheel or brakes). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ride is easily adjustable to fit a wide range of riders, though it’s always included just one crank length. That isn’t going to change just yet – Zwift Ride frames will still ship with 170mm length cranks. But for riders who need something different or who want to experiment with different crank lengths, Zwift now has a new option. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Ride adjustable crank arm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-11-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sold as an accessory, the new Zwift Ride Adjustable Cranks come in an upgrade kit that sells for $99. Inside, you’ll find a crankarm kit with a ‘bearclaw’ design that has five different crank length positions on the same crank arm. To change crank lengths, you simply change the location of the pedal to one of the five labeled holes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift mentions that unless you’re a fairly proficient home mechanic, you should plan on having a bike shop swap out the original cranks for you. We’re told that it is a standard square taper interface for the crank, so it shouldn’t be too hard, but you will at least need a proper torque wrench. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Ride adjustable crank arm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Zwift-communtiy-Live-event-mallorca-2025-10-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once installed, riders can choose from 160, 165, 170, 172.5, and 175mm crank lengths.
