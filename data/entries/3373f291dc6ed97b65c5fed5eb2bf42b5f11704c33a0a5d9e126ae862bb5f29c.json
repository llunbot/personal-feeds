From what we can tell, people \nlove it so far.” [...] </p>\n\n<p>“I’ve thought for a long time there should be a billion-person \npublic conversations app that is a bit more positive,” Zuckerberg \nsaid on Wednesday’s call. “I think that if we keep at this for a \nfew more years, then I think we have a good chance of achieving \nour vision there.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More and more, my social media attention is split between Mastodon and Threads. I like them both, for different reasons.
