They discovered the first of what is now known to be a large collection of MicroRNAs, short (21-23 bases long) RNAs that bind to and alter the behavior of protein-coding RNAs. While first discovered in a roundworm, they've since been discovered to play key roles in the development of most complex life.</p>\n<p>The story behind the discovery is typical of a lot of the progress in the biological sciences: genetics helps identify a gene important for the development of one species, and then evolutionary conservation reveals its widespread significance.</p>\n<h2>In the worm</h2>\n<p>Ambros and Ruvkun started on the path to discovery while post-doctoral fellows in the lab of earlier Nobel winner Robert Horvitz, who won for his role in developing the roundworm <em>C. elegans</em> as an experimental genetic organism. As part of the early genetic screens, people had identified a variety of mutations that caused developmental problems for specific lineages of cells. These <em>lin</em> mutations included <em>lin-4</em>, which Ambros was characterizing. It lacked a number of specialized cell types, as well as the physical structures that depended on them.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/medicine-nobel-goes-to-previously-unknown-way-of-controlling-genes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/medicine-nobel-goes-to-previously-unknown-way-of-controlling-genes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da27b7461eda9035e2022e462ed5fd73ea0fb21f79e65a7c2fd3f149bac54767","category":"Tech"}
