Study after study has shown that minority drivers are ticketed at a higher rate, and data from speed cameras suggests that it's not because they commit traffic violations more frequently. But this leaves open the question of why. Bias is an obvious answer, but it's hard to eliminate an alternative explanation: Minority groups may engage in more unsafe driving, and the police are trying to deter that.</p>\n<p>But now, Lyft has given a group of researchers access to detailed data from their drivers. The results confirm that minority drivers get more tickets, and they pay higher fines when they do. And the results also show that minorities aren't in any way more likely to speed or engage in unsafe driving. Which suggests, in their words, that the problem is \"animus\" against minority drivers.</p>\n<h2>Giving research a Lyft</h2>\n<p>The work was done thanks to cooperation from the ridesharing company Lyft, which provided data on its drivers in Florida, all 222,838 of them, along with a record of all the GPS pings their tracking systems sent into the company's servers. Combined with a detailed map of Florida's roads, along with their speed limits, they could determine when a given driver was speeding. They also obtained Florida police records of any accidents and cross-referenced their locations to any vehicle that experienced a sudden stop in that spot at the same time.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/study-of-lyft-rideshare-data-confirms-minorities-get-more-tickets/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/study-of-lyft-rideshare-data-confirms-minorities-get-more-tickets/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fce9cd67b0f90b334e9b75759a01b07d1a395bbcaf9aca0cec1557ddc33027d0","category":"Tech"}
