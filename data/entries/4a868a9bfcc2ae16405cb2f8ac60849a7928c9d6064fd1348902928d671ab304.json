Cafe Du Cycliste’s Solange riding flannel is more than just a buffalo plaid shirt. It’s a fleece jersey made from recycled yarn with three cargo pockets that’s designed to keep you warm in the coldest riding conditions. These made in the EU jerseys are available for men and women in a variety of colors and ship for free.
