{"title":"Counterpoint Says U.S. Smartphone Sales Are Down, But Mostly on the Android Side","link":"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-smartphone-shipments-q2-2023/","date":1690821630000,"content":"\n<p>Matthew Orf, writing for Counterpoint Research:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>US smartphone shipments declined 24% YoY in Q2 2023, according to\nCounterpoint Research’s Market Monitor data. This was the third\nconsecutive quarter of YoY declines. Android brands like Samsung,\nMotorola and TCL-Alcatel saw the steepest declines in shipments,\nwhile Apple’s shipments were more resilient. As a result, Apple’s\nshare of shipments increased YoY.</p>\n\n<p>Android smartphone shipments declined 38% while Apple shipments\nfell 6% YoY.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Samsung’s sales — according to Counterpoint — were exactly in line with Android overall, down 37 percent overall. You’d think they’d be up, not down, with all those <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/jackasses_of_the_week_techradar\">foldables</a> they sell. Another interesting tidbit: Counterpoint claims Google Pixel sales are up 48 percent year-over-year. If true, maybe, finally, Pixels are starting to get traction? I have to give Google credit for doggedly sticking with it.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s share of shipments in Counterpoint’s tallying has been 50+ percent for 4 consecutive quarters.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/counterpoint-us-phone-sales-down\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2036d47cb06265cfedc738f8622c89faea2e04ffdc9a5f4a5f96a650bca41d97","category":"Tech"}
