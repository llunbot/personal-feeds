The answer to that question heavily depends on who you ask. For certain students and professionals, the iPad Pro’s superior display, Apple Pencil input, and portability have made it the ideal productivity device. In fact, I earned my BA in English Language and Literature and worked as a TV script translator, all while relying solely on an iPad. However, it’s a different story for those with advanced workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, flagship iPads pack Apple’s M-series chipsets, similar to those powering the latest Macs. Nonetheless, the mobile operating system’s software limitations prevent the tablet from performing a range of desktop-class tasks. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2766625/ipados-19-release-date-compatilbity-features-beta.html\">iPadOS 19</a> is rumored to address some of these shortcomings by improving multitasking, productivity, and window management. I’m all for that, but Apple needs to think big—these nine macOS features need to be at the centerpiece of the update to truly unlock the iPad’s full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>App sideloading support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS is the only Apple operating system that permits users to install apps outside the App Store without jumping through endless hoops. If an application fails the App Store’s unforgiving screening process, developers can still distribute it independently to users all over the world, which enables Mac users to install third-party apps that don’t necessarily comply with Apple’s guidelines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand why Apple wants to keep <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2770849/i-sideloaded-a-reddit-client-onto-my-iphone-i-never-want-to-do-it-again.html\">sideloading</a> away from the iPhone, but the iPad is a different animal. If your workflow depends on a noncompliant or niche app, there’s no straightforward way to obtain it on your iPad—and that’s a dealbreaker for many. To truly match desktop flexibility, iPadOS 19 should support direct .IPA file installation. Maybe then people can stop looking at it as a giant iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac software compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The highest-end iPads now use the same processors as Mac computers. Yet, while macOS can run iPad apps, iPadOS still can’t run Mac software. Consequently, those relying on desktop-exclusive apps, such as Xcode, can’t completely ditch their computers. Similarly, those who already bought lifetime licenses for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2417277/final-cut-pro-for-ipad-2-0-and-final-cut-camera-review.html\">Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro</a> on macOS can’t access these tools on their tablets (without paying recurring subscription fees for the mobile editions). Since the iPad has a cursor when connected to a Magic Keyboard, Apple could realistically address this limitation and expand the iPad’s app library by supporting Mac software on iPadOS 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An improved cursor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the cursor, the one iPadOS has is significantly larger than that of macOS and features a magnetic effect that pulls it toward UI elements. I understand why it behaves that way, since iPadOS is a touch-first OS with large targets to accommodate human fingers, but it’s not conducive to getting serious work done. With iPadOS 19 and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">macOS 16</a> rumored to adopt similar looks, now is Apple’s chance to finally develop a more intuitive pointer for its tablet. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Window management on macOS\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Window-management-on-macOS.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Window management needs to be priority No. 1 for iPadOS to be more like macOS.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enhanced window management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, while iPadOS currently supports resizable app windows via Stage Manager, the feature is extremely limited compared to the Mac’s window management. The execution feels wonky and pushes me to use the traditional Split View and Slide Over multitasking features. iPadOS 19 is rumored to be getting a multitasking upgrade, and I can’t think of anything better than adopting a macOS-like approach that’s fully optimized for tablets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Upgraded built-in apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since iOS and iPadOS split in 2019, Apple has been distinguishing its own iPad apps by offering new UIs exclusive to the larger displays. Nevertheless, in terms of functionality, these apps continue to mimic, even mirror, the iPhone and its limitations. So, macOS features such as Smart Playlists in Apple Music and system file browsing in Finder are absent from the iPad. To lure power users, iPadOS 19 should upgrade its stock apps by bringing over some of what we love about the Mac versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Extended work environments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of power users, the premium <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">M4 iPad Pro</a> still limits you to a single external monitor. Meanwhile, Macs support multiple physical screens and virtual desktops. This lets users jump between different sets of opened apps by creating several environments with distinct layouts based on the tasks they’re focusing on. Similar capabilities in iPadOS would help make it a much better platform for getting serious work done.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Multiple desktops on macOS\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multiple-desktops-on-macOS.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Virtual desktops are a great thing for productivity and organization on the Mac, and they’d be just as good on the iPad.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671444/how-to-back-up-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">iPhone backup</a> tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Mac and a USB-C cable, you can back up, restore, or update your iPhone just by plugging it in. While newer iPads can repair your bricked iPhone wirelessly, they’re incapable of creating local, full-device backups. Similarly, they can’t update your iPhone’s OS when it doesn’t have sufficient storage to download the package over the air. If Apple wants the iPad to be a true productivity device, it needs to have full control over the iPhone like the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multiple user profiles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one that we’ve wanted forever. Many households have a single iPad shared by several people, but iPadOS is still tied to a single user. Apple has already built and shipped multi-user profiles, but confoundingly, it’s limited to iPads managed by educational institutions. We don’t know why Apple refuses to allow multiple users on the iPad, but that needs to change if Apple’s tablet wants to be more like the Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Continuity features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the Mac offers special Continuity features that work seamlessly with iOS. With macOS Monterey 12, Apple added support for AirPlay receiving, letting you cast media from your iPhone to the computer’s larger display. And with macOS Sequoia 15, the company introduced <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2404049/how-iphone-mirroring-lets-you-access-your-iphone-on-your-mac-in-macos-sequoia.html\">iPhone Mirroring</a>, enabling users to fully control their iPhones, view iOS notifications, and more. Both of these features are missing from iPadOS, further chaining its potential.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone Mirroring on macOS\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Mirroring-on-macOS-.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>We don’t need to mirror our iPhone on the iPad as often as we do on our Macs, but it would be cool if we could.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Could this be the year?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad seems to be stuck in limbo, and I struggle to figure out where it’s heading. There’s no denying that every annual OS update makes the device more capable, but ultimately, the new features all hit the same obstacles. For example, I had high hopes when Stage Manager was first announced, only to be disappointed by the same main set of limitations soon after trying it. When compared to Windows tablets such as Microsoft’s Surface, the iPad has a long way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while I’m still skeptical, the iPadOS 19 rumors are a glimmer of hope. I’m doubtful that many of the features here make it to the iPad this year (or anytime soon for that matter), but iPadOS 19 is a chance for Apple to elevate the tablet above its iPhone roots and carve out a productivity niche for people who want something more versatile than a Mac. We’ll see if it happens.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ee369696c0b6ef04555401475e7e6b442d0d995e3372755d5b74266abff443f9","category":"Apple"}
