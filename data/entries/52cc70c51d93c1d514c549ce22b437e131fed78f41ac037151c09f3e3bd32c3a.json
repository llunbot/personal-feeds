One highlight of the sale is the return of all-time low prices on the Eufy brand of Bluetooth trackers. You can get the SmartTrack Link in various packs, including <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BNVFJMZR%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY_1683725678906\"><strong>$26.99</strong></a> for a 2-pack and <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BN86R2HC%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY_1683725753275\"><strong>$48.99</strong></a> for a 4-pack.

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese trackers work with Apple's Find My app and are perfect for keeping track of luggage and other necessities while traveling. Compared to previous sales, these are some of the best prices we've tracked on the Bluetooth trackers, although this time we aren't seeing any deals on the SmartTrack Card.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BNVFJMZR%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.3OXE91YFEC8XY_1683725678906\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$9 OFF</div>Eufy SmartTrack Link 2-Pack for $26.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother highlight is the Eufy Security SmartDrop Package Box, which is down to <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB099ZNTGY1\"><strong>$199.99</strong></a> for Prime members on Amazon, from $399.99. We last tracked this deal in August and it's a match of the all-time low price on the product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Eufy package box provides a secure location for your packages to be delivered, and sends notifications to your smartphone when items arrive. Right now it has an estimated delivery date of September 26 from Amazon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB099ZNTGY1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>50% OFF</div>Eufy SmartDrop Package Box for $199.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the SmartDrop Package Box there are a few other Anker accessories on sale today, both on Amazon and on Anker's website. <a href=\"https://howl.me/cke1MBLrLCd\">On the Anker website</a>, you'll find both individual deals on charging accessories as well as a few bundle offers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShoppers should note that for both websites, <strong>most of the deals below will require you to clip an on-page coupon</strong>. On Amazon, you can do this by simply clicking the box near the green text under the price of the accessory, and then you'll see the price at checkout. On Anker, you can hit the \"copy code\" button then proceed to \"buy now\" in order to get the discount.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Cables and Wall Chargers</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/anker-charger-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><ul><li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0BRN782WY%3Fth%3D1\">USB-C to USB-C Cable (6ft 2-Pack)</a> -
