But in <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/04/07/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22621-1546-and-22624-1546/\">a beta build released earlier this month</a>, the company changed something even older: Pressing the Print Screen button on your keyboard will open the Snipping Tool rather than copying the contents of your screen to the clipboard to be pasted into an image-editing app.</p>\n<p>In the current non-beta version of Windows 11, this Print Screen behavior is an off-by-default toggle in the keyboard accessibility settings. The change will make the setting on-by-default instead.</p>\n<p>In the old MS-DOS days before graphical user interfaces became the norm, the function of the Print Screen button was quite literalâ€”take whatever text was on-screen and print it with an actual physical printer. (Old keyboards also had room to write \"print screen\" on a keycap, whereas most modern keyboards shorten it to \"prt sc\" or something similarly inscrutable to people who don't already know what the key does.) The more abstract copy-to-clipboard behavior dates at least as far back as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0\">Windows 3.0</a>, which was originally released in 1990. Windows' built-in screenshot tools have changed, from the Snipping Tool to Windows 10's Snip &amp; Sketch back to Windows 11's Snipping tool, but the Print Screen key kept on doing the same thing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931059#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931059&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bb602ed60b95ef849a0859d971e0833edaebc843a7b94458609c9d25c5ab5edf","category":"Tech"}
