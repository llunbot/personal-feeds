Valve announced this week that it will stop supporting Steam on Windows 7 and Windows 8 on January 1, 2024. \"After that date,\" the company's <a href=\"https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A\">brief announcement reads</a>, \"the Steam Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows.\"</p>\n<p>That timeline is still fairly generous to users of the 14- and 11-year-old operating systems, given that Microsoft ended all support for both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/closing-time-windows-7-and-windows-8-1-have-received-their-last-updates/\">in January 2023</a>. GPU makers like Nvidia and AMD also stopped supporting their latest GPUs in Windows 7 or Windows 8 quite a while ago.</p>\n<p>This move will affect a vanishingly small but persistent number of Steam users. According to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam\">Valve's own survey data for February of 2023</a>, the 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 account for a little less than two percent of all Steam usage. This is almost nothing next to Windows 10 and Windows 11 (nearly 95 percent), but all macOS versions combined account for only 2.37 percent, and all Linux versions combined (including the Steam Deck) add up to just 1.27 percent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927550#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927550&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e046e9f6ca9b98270bc721180c61424e79d7f060f117d9285894a14f9e14c15","category":"Tech"}
