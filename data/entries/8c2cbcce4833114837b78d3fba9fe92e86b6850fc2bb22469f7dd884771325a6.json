Even though this merry fellow didn’t make an appearance in the Peter Jackson trilogy, he’s the most powerful being in Middle Earth. Sporting a blue jacket and yellow boots, Tom helped the Hobbits evade the Ring Wraiths in <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. Loving the diagatube on the Bombadil, John took partial inspiration for this build from the Breezer Series I bikes, lacing it out with a mix of late 1970s and early 1980s components. The result is one stunning and classic <a href=\"https://www.rivbike.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rivendell</a>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/Mone%CC%81-Bikes-Hachita-All-Rounder.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo: John Watson</em></p>\n<h3>#4 <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mone-bikes-hachita-all-rounder/\" target=\"_blank\">The Monē Bikes Hachita Prototype All-Rounder</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sincerecycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sincere Cycles</a> founder <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/baileygenenewbrey/\" target=\"_blank\">Bailey Newbrey</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.monebikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Monē Bikes</a> pro rider. You didn’t know that? Well he is. Since Cjell <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bailey-and-his-custom-mone-bikes-singlespeed-29er-touring-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">built Bailey his tourer</a>, it’s now being offered as a standard “pro” model bike. Neat. As such, Cjell sends Bailey his working prototypes for a bit of PR&amp;D. Since building up this prototype Hachita, named after one of the last towns on the Tour Divide, Bailey has raced it at an XC MTB race, taken it on numerous overnighters, tackled our rocky singletrack, and used it to commute every day. Perhaps that’s why it’s in the #4 position on this list? Rim brakes. Check. All-rounder capabilities. Check.

Pulling influence from some strange corners of the bike world and outfitting the frame with some amazing and unique parts, Clint’s<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/saltaircycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"> SaltAir</a> stood out for more reasons than its single rear cog. Clint rode this pink dream on all 92 miles of the Enve Grodeo, a feat in itself regardless of it being a fixed gear 26-er.
