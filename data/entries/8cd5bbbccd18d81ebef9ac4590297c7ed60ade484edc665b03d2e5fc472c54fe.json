{"title":"Kevin Mitnick Dies From Pancreatic Cancer at 59","link":"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/las-vegas-nv/kevin-mitnick-11371668","date":1689886666000,"content":"\n<p>Tragic news from King David Memorial Chapel and Cemetery in Las Vegas:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kevin David Mitnick, 59, died peacefully on Sunday, July 16, 2023,\nafter valiantly battling pancreatic cancer for more than a year.\nKevin is survived by his beloved wife, Kimberley Mitnick, who\nremained by his side throughout their 14-month ordeal. Kimberley\nis pregnant with their first child. Kevin was ecstatic about this\nnew chapter in his and Kimberley’s life together, which has now\nbeen sadly cut short.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All cancers can go fuck themselves, but man, pancreatic cancer has taken so many people of late: Alex Trebek, Pixar animator <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston\">Ralph Eggleston</a>, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and of course Steve Jobs. Just brutal to hear that his wife is pregnant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kevin emerged from his final prison term, which he deemed a\n“vacation”, in January 2000. He was a changed individual, and\nbegan constructing a new career, as a White Hat hacker and\nsecurity consultant. He became a highly sought-after global public\nspeaker, a writer, and established the successful Mitnick Security\nConsulting. In November 2011, he became the Chief Hacking Officer\nand part owner of security awareness training company KnowBe4,\nfounded by close friend and business partner Stu Sjouwerman.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin attracted attention and support from unlikely sources. The\nbus driver who saw young Kevin memorize the bus schedules, punch\ncards and punch tool systems so he could ride the buses all day\nfor free testified as a character witness for Kevin during his\nfederal trial. The federal prosecutor offered his testimony that\nKevin never tried to take one dime from any of his “victims”. The\nprobation officer assigned to monitor Kevin after prison gave\nKevin permission to write his first book on a laptop when he was\nnot yet supposed to have access to computers. Shawn Nunley, the\nstar witness in the FBI’s case against Kevin, became so\ndisillusioned with the government’s treatment of Kevin that he\ncontacted Kevin’s defense team, helped garner Kevin’s release, and\nbecame one of Kevin’s dearest friends. Kevin had an irresistible\nway of converting foes to friends and keeping them as friends\nforever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mitnick was technically gifted, but his greatest hacking skill was social engineering.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8cd5bbbccd18d81ebef9ac4590297c7ed60ade484edc665b03d2e5fc472c54fe","category":"Tech"}
