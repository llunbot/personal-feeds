Opposition poured in before a House <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/events/communications-and-technology-subcommittee-hearing-legislative-proposal-to-sunset-section-230-of-the-communications-decency-act\">hearing</a> today on the bipartisan plan to \"sunset\" Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives online platforms <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/section-230-the-internet-law-politicians-love-to-hate-explained/\">immunity from lawsuits</a> over how they moderate user-submitted content.</p>\n<p>Lawmakers defended the proposed repeal.

The lawmakers haven't come up with a replacement for the law, a tactic that some critics predict will lead to legislative chaos. A <a href=\"https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/05_22_24_Section_230_Leg_C_and_T_Hearing_Memo_1_9e8995c30b.pdf\">hearing memo</a> said the draft bill \"would sunset Section 230 of the Communications Act effective on December 31, 2025,\" but claimed the \"intent of the legislation is not to have Section 230 actually sunset, but to encourage all technology companies to work with Congress to advance a long-term reform solution to Section 230.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026242#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026242&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5428c04a1bcc8f8ecf817f9ea92c2a04722764ce3b8f2d557c2191fc5e2b8bfd","category":"Tech"}
