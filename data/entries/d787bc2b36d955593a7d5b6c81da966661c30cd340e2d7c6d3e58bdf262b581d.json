With a single click, any future emails sent by those nuisance addresses automatically landed in my spam folder.</p>\n<h2>Blocked but not blocked</h2>\n<p>At some point, the block address feature stopped working. When I use the feature now to block an address, I see a message telling me that all future emails from the address will go to my spam folder. Which is exactly what I want. But that’s not what happens. Emails from those addresses continue to go right into my inbox.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814550#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814550&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d787bc2b36d955593a7d5b6c81da966661c30cd340e2d7c6d3e58bdf262b581d","category":"Tech"}
