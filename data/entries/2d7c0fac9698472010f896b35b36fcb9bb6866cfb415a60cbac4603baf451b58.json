I've just spent a week with Alfa's latest creation, the unfortunately named Tonale, and it has left me scratching my head. Beset by gremlins and not exactly cheap, it nonetheless charmed me in a way that I really don't think would have happened if I'd been driving, say, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/an-alfa-romeo-bar-the-badge-we-drive-the-2024-dodge-hornet-rt-plug-in/\">a Dodge</a>.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, Alfa Romeo was Ferrari before there really was a Ferrari, building Grand Prix-winning race cars and drop-dead gorgeous road cars. That feels like a very long time ago now. A planned resurgence, set in motion while the brand was under the control of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/sergio-marchionne-the-man-who-saved-fiat-chyrsler-dies-at-66/\">the late Sergio Marchionne</a>, has fallen far short of its original ambitious sales targetsâ€”<a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/article/20170603/RETAIL01/170609910/alfa-crossover-critical-to-marchionne-s-turnaround\">100,000 Guilias a year</a>, we were told at the time.</p>\n<p>But the brand lives on, and it has an all-new model out. The Tonale is a smaller crossover than the Stelvio, and here in the US it is only available with a plug-in hybrid powertrain. It pairs a 180 hp (135 kW), 1.3 L four-cylinder gasoline engine that drives the front wheels via a six-speed automatic transmission with a 121 hp (90 kW) electric motor that drives the rear wheels, fed by a 15.5 kWh lithium-ion battery.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986441#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986441&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
