Some of the content simply reworded articles that originally appeared on TUAW, while other articles tied real writers' names to new, AI-generated articles about current events.</p>\n<p>(Disclosure: I worked with Warren at Mashable several years ago, and before that, I also worked at the original parent company of TUAW.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036525#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036525&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"444cbb0a442e207f0b4c5ce14183fdf657c48b143e7c3490a6991a363ebce138","category":"Tech"}
