The carbon models start at £1,299/$1,599/€1,299, rising to £1,999/$2,299/€1,999.</p>\n<p>The wheelsets are set to feature on Orbea’s forthcoming season of road and gravel bikes, and will be available to customise using the company’s MyO bike programme.</p>\n<h2>Range spec and details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oquo RP 45 LTD wheelset rim bed\" title=\"Oquo RP 45 LTD wheelset rim bed\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A 21mm internal rim width is on-trend.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Road Performance</h3>\n<p>The Oquo Road Performance wheelsets come in six options, covering three tiers.</p>\n<p>All carbon wheels feature a 21mm internal rim width, paired to a ‘mini-hook’ rim design.</p>\n<p>This mini-hook design preserves clincher compatibility and enables the use of higher <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressures</a> (up to 95psi/6.5 BAR for tubeless, and 116psi/8 BAR with tubes) than with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hookless rims</a>.</p>\n<p>Orbea says it also makes tyre changes simpler, thanks to the slanted profile of the hook’s outer-facing edge, which helps tyres slide over the rim with greater ease.</p>\n<p>The rims are optimised for use with 700 x 25-32c tyres, though Orbea says you could run up to 35c rubber, if you choose.</p>\n<p>The top-spec LTD carbon wheelsets feature Sapim CX-Ray aero spokes (24 front, 24 rear) and Zipp Cognition hubs spinning on ‘premium’ Swiss steel bearings.</p>\n<p>The Cognition rear hub has 54 points of engagement. It also features Zipp’s Axial Clutch system, using six magnets and a Sylomer spring mechanism, which is said to help the hub engage as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>The rear hub also has a star-flange straight-pull design, which is said to distribute riding forces with greater balance than a conventional layout.</p>\n<p>The LTD wheelsets are available in 57, 45 and 35mm rim depths, with claimed weights of 1,520g, 1,380g and 1,360g, respectively.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zipp Cognition rear hub\" title=\"Zipp Cognition rear hub\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zipp’s Cognition hubs can also be found on the American brand’s top-tier NSW road wheelsets.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The mid-level TEAM carbon wheelsets share the same carbon rims (both in terms of layup and shape), but have cheaper Sapim CX-Sprint spokes and Zipp ZR1 hubs.</p>\n<p>The ZR1 rear hub features 66 points of engagement, while both hubs spin on stainless steel bearings.</p>\n<p>These are available in 45 and 35mm rim depths, and weigh a claimed 1,495g and 1,465g, respectively.</p>\n<p>The entry-level PRO wheelset features a 35mm-deep alloy rim with a 19mm internal width, Sapim CX-Sprint spokes and Zipp ZR1 hubs. At time of publication, Orbea hasn’t shared a claimed weight.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other Road Performance wheelset, which features lightweight alloy nipples, the PRO wheelset has black anodised brass nipples (which should prove more corrosion resistant).</p>\n<p>All Road Performance wheelsets are available with HG and XDR <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehub</a> bodies. There is no N3W option at the time of launch.</p>\n<h4>RP 57 LTD</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oquo RP 57 LTD wheelset\" title=\"OQUO_RP_57_LTD\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oquo RP 57 LTD wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Rim material:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Rim depth:</strong> 57mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rim width (internal):</strong> 21mm</li>\n<li><strong>Hub:</strong> Zipp Cognition V2</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Sapim CX-Ray</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke count:</strong> 24/24</li>\n<li><strong>Nipples:</strong> Sapim alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Disc mount:</strong> Centerlock</li>\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> 1,520g</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,999/$2,299/€1,999</li>\n</ul><h4>RP 45 LTD</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oquo RP 45 LTD wheelset\" title=\"OQUO_RP_45_LTD\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oquo RP 45 LTD wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Rim material:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Rim depth:</strong> 45mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rim width (internal): </strong>21mm</li>\n<li><strong>Hub:</strong> Zipp Cognition V2</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Sapim CX-Ray</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke count:</strong> 24/24</li>\n<li><strong>Nipples:</strong> Sapim alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Disc mount:</strong> Centerlock</li>\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> 1,380g</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,999/$2,299/€1,999</li>\n</ul><h4>RP 35 LTD</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oquo RP 35 LTD wheelset\" title=\"OQUO_RP_35_LTD\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oquo RP 35 LTD wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Rim material:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Rim depth:</strong> 35mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rim width (internal):</strong> 21mm</li>\n<li><strong>Hub:</strong> Zipp Cognition V2</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Sapim CX-Ray TCS</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke count:</strong> 24/24</li>\n<li><strong>Nipples:</strong> Sapim alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Disc mount:</strong> Centerlock</li>\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> 1,360g</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,999/$2,299/€1,999</li>\n</ul><h4>RP 45 TEAM</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oquo RP 45 TEAM wheelset\" title=\"OQUO_RP_45_TEAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oquo RP 45 TEAM wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Rim material:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Rim depth:</strong> 45mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rim width (internal):</strong> 21mm</li>\n<li><strong>Hub:</strong> Zipp ZR1</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Sapim CX-Sprint</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke count:</strong> 24/24</li>\n<li><strong>Nipples:</strong> Sapim alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Disc mount:</strong> Centerlock</li>\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> 1,495g</li>\n<li>Price: £1,299/$1,599/€1,299</li>\n</ul><h4>RP 35 TEAM</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oquo RP 35 TEAM wheelset\" title=\"OQUO_RP_35_TEAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oquo RP 35 TEAM wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Rim material:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Rim depth:</strong> 35mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rim width (internal):</strong> 21mm</li>\n<li><strong>Hub:</strong> Zipp ZR1</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Sapim CX-Sprint Oxi</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke count:</strong> 24/24</li>\n<li><strong>Nipples:</strong> Sapim alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Disc mount:</strong> Centerlock</li>\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> 1,465g</li>\n<li>Price: £1,299/$1,599/€1,299</li>\n</ul><h4>RP 35 PRO</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oquo RP 35 PRO wheelset\" title=\"OQUO_RP_35_PRO\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oquo RP 35 PRO wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Rim material:</strong> Alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Rim depth:</strong> 35mm</li>\n<li><strong>Rim width (internal):</strong> 19mm</li>\n<li><strong>Hub:</strong> Zipp ZR1</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Sapim CX-Sprint</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke count:</strong> 24/24</li>\n<li><strong>Nipples:</strong> Sapim brass (black)</li>\n<li><strong>Disc mount:</strong> Centerlock</li>\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> N/A</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £599/$799/£599</li>\n</ul><h3>Road Control</h3>\n<p>The two Oquo Road Control wheelsets are pitched towards the broad churches of endurance, all-road and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>.</p>\n<p>Both wheelsets have a 25mm internal width and feature the mini-hook design.
