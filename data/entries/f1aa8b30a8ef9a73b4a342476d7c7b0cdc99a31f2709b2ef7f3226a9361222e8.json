Track <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uci-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\">World Championships</a> in Ballerup, Denmark, with 13 medals in total, claiming second overall in the table behind the Netherlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an all-woman affair for gold medals. Anna Morris put in the performance of a lifetime to beat defending champion Chloé Dygert of the United States in the individual pursuit, while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/emma-finucane-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Emma Finucane</a> beat the Netherlands’ Hetty van de Wouw 2-0 for rainbow bands in the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pair won an additional two gold medals, with Morris winning the team pursuit alongside Jessica Roberts, Katie Archibald and Josie Knight, and Finucane in the team sprint with Katy Marchant and Sophie Capewell against the Netherlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, it was a double gold for Japan in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/japanese-keirin-sport-and-culture-beyond-the-velodrome\" target=\"_blank\">keirin</a>, with the rainbow jersey coming home to the place where the discipline originated thanks to Kento Yamasaki, who became the first Japanese rider to win in the discipline since 1987, and Mina Sato for the women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands’ Lorena Wiebes had a phenomenal debut Track World Championships as she won the scratch race ahead of defending champion Jennifer Valente. Great Britain’s Josh Charlton broke the world record set by Filippo Ganna in qualifying for the individual pursuit with a time of 3min 59.304sec, but was bested by Italy’s Jonathan Milan in the gold medal ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some big names retired at the end of the five-day event. Danish rider Julie Norman Leth bowed out after winning the points race and the madison, the latter alongside Amalie Dideriksen. Michael Mørkøv, another Dane, raced in his last Track Worlds and won bronze in the madison with Niklas Larsen. Great Britain’s Dan Bigham also retired from pro racing after he won a bronze medal against teammate Charlie Tanfield in the individual pursuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Harrie Lavreysen does the triple</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178779972.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Arne Mill/BSR Agency/Getty Images</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen came into the Track World Championships as the defending champion in the sprint and team sprint. He would also compete in the keirin, in which he is a three-time World Champion, and make his debut in the men’s 1km time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He got off to a perfect start, winning gold in the team sprint with Roy van den Berg and Jeffrey Hoogland against Australia, but a surprise exit in the semi-finals of the keirin meant he only managed eighth overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His next event was described as a ‘challenge’ in the 1km time-trial, in which he was making his World Championships debut. In typical Lavreysen fashion, the 27-year-old topped the standings with 57.321sec for victory, 0.9sec ahead of defending champion and friend Hoogland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of days later, he finished the World Championships with another gold medal by once again beating Hoogland in the men’s sprint. With his 16 titles in total, it had been a record-breaking week, Lavreysen now the most accomplished track cyclist in the World Championships after overtaking France’s Arnaud Tournant (14).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Eli Iserbyt handed three-race ban</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2178159382.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>David Pintens/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgian cyclocross rider Eli Iserbyt has been fined 2,500 Swiss francs (approx £2,225) and given a three-race ban after he stomped on rival Ryan Kamp’s bike. Iserbyt and Kamp both came down in a crash at Exact Cross Beringen last week and Iserbyt stamped on his opponent’s bike before the pair exchanged words. He was soon pulled from the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iserbyt apologised for his actions on social media and went on to place second in his next race prior to his suspension. Kamp has since revealed Iserbyt apologised to him on the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Wout van Aert on The Masked Singer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240830VUE5005-Unipublic___Cxcling.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic / Cxcling</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours are flying that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> will be revealed as the Squirrel on the Belgian version of <em>The Masked Singe</em>r this Friday.
