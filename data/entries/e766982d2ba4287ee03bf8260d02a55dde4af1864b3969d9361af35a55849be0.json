They add some extra power on the flat too.</p>\n<p>You can turn your focus to climbing the steepest, most technical slopes you can find – or just go longer and faster with a grin from ear-to-ear. The ability to cover ground quickly means you can go out and explore places you wouldn’t otherwise consider.</p>\n<p>These bikes also enable you to ride in ways you usually couldn’t. As designs become more refined, their handling increasingly rivals – and in some cases exceeds – that of non-assisted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>For more on what to look for when buying an e-MTB, read our buyer’s guide at the bottom of this article.

It’s a stripped-back ‘eMTB Lite’, with less power and weight than a fully assisted eMTB, that Orbea says is “less e, more bike”.</p>\n<p>The Rise H10 gets a larger battery than the original, at 540Wh, and is powered by a 60Nm Shimano EP8 motor that’s throttled down to limit its usual 85Nm torque and extend range. You can add a 252Wh range extender.</p>\n<p>The H10’s frame has nicely smoothed welds at the top tube junctions that could fool you into thinking it’s carbon, and side-on it’s not obvious there’s a battery in the down tube either. Geometry is trail-oriented and modern but not cutting-edge.</p>\n<p>With its higher-torque motor than the Specialized Turbo Levo SL, the Rise feels more powerful on climbs. It can handle rougher, steeper trails, although it’s not as sure-footed as more enduro-oriented ebikes. It’s happiest on rollercoaster singletrack and berms though.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/orbea-rise-h10-review/\">Read our full Orbea Rise H10 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Orbea Wild M-Team</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orbea Wild M-Team eMTB\" title=\"Orbea-Wild-M-Team-01-8068d40-e1683795221213_BOTY 2023 winner\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Orbea Wild M-Team is our 2023 eMTB Bike of the Year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£9,207/$9,844/€9,727/AU$17,429 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Bosch motor and battery;

When descending, there’s a direct, taut feeling, but that can translate to a stiff, harsh ride over bumpy terrain.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/giant-reign-e-1-review/\">Read our full Giant Reign E+ 1 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Saracen Ariel 50E Elite</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Saracen Ariel 50E Elite full suspension eMTB\" title=\"Saracen Ariel 50E Elite - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Saracen’s Ariel 50E Elite is the brand’s only electric mountain bike and is aimed squarely at the all-mountain and enduro categories.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£6,500 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> High-quality spec</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Geometry, battery capacity and tyre choice let the bike down</li>\n</ul><p>With 150mm travel from a Fox DHX2 Factory shock and a 160mm-travel Fox 38 Factory fork, a Shimano M8100 XT drivetrain, DT Swiss wheels and Shimano EP8 motor, the Saracen’s spec is impressive.</p>\n<p>The 504Wh battery limits range though and we’d like to see a slacker head angle than the 65 degrees on offer, which limited performance on steep sections.

There’s adjustable geometry and some quality parts, including a Fox 38 Performance Elite fork and Float X2 Performance shock, with a SRAM X01/NX Eagle drivetrain, Shimano XT brakes and a Bosch Performance Line CX motor. We reckon it’s reasonable value for money.</p>\n<p>We found the ride wasn’t quite as calm or controlled as some rivals though. The rear tyre choice led to slipping on climbs and the downhill ride felt raw and un-smoothed. A tyre swap-out might remedy much of this.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/scott-ransom-eride-910/\">Read our full Scott Ransom eRide 910 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Thok TK01 R</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Thok TK01 R enduro electric mountain bike\" title=\"Thok TK01 R enduro electric mountain bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The TK01 R is a striking-looking bike with its bold moto-style graphics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£5,900/€6,490 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Good motor and spec for the price</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Awkward setup and geometry; poor tyre choice</li>\n</ul><p>Italian ebike specialist Thok gives you 170mm travel with its enduro-oriented, alloy-framed TK01 R.

We found the range lower than with the stock Shimano battery though and were only getting around 1,000m of climbing in Boost mode.</p>\n<p>There’s a rearward-biased seated position, which means care is needed to prevent front-wheel lift on climbs. Performance downhill is poppy and fun, encouraging flicking across the trail and confidence in corners, although on steeps a slacker head tube would lead to improved handling.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/yt-decoy-core-4-mx-review/\">Read our full YT Decoy Core 4 MX review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2>Buyer’s guide to electric mountain bikes</h2>\n<h3>Electric mountain bike types</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist riding the Overvolt GLP2 full suspension mountain ebike over rocks\" title=\"Lapierre Overvolt GLP2 Team review 16\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can now find capable electric bikes for all types of mountain biking.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mathieu Echeverri / Lapierre</i></span></div>\n<p>Whereas first-generation e-MTBs tended to be trail-oriented with around 150mm of travel, there’s now an increasing range of mountain bike disciplines covered.</p>\n<p>That includes overbuilt models designed for downhill use at one end of the spectrum, including the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/specialized-s-works-turbo-kenevo-sl-review/\">Specialized Turbo Kenevo</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/cannondale-moterra-neo-carbon-se-review/\">Cannondale Moterra Neo</a>.</p>\n<p>At the other end, there are lighter machines such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/specialized-turbo-levo-sl-comp-carbon/\">Specialized Turbo Levo SL</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/lapierre-ezesty-am-ltd-ultimate-review/\">Lapierre eZesty</a> that use lighter, less powerful motors and smaller batteries similar to electric road bikes. That drops the bike’s weight and ups agility over more heavily built machines.</p>\n<p>You’ll find e-MTBs with either 29in or 27.5in wheels, but ‘<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet builds</a>’ with a 29in wheel up front and a 27.5in rear are becoming increasingly common. This setup gives good stability at the front and better agility from the smaller rear wheel. Examples include the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-canyon-spectral-on/\">Canyon Spectral:ON</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/vitus-e-escarpe-vrx-review/\">Vitus E-Escarpe</a>.</p>\n<p>Most e-MTBs are full-suspension bikes, but you can also find trail-oriented electric hardtails, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-grand-canyon-on/\">Canyon Grand Canyon:ON</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/kinesis-rise-hardtail-e-bike/\">Kinesis Rise</a>.</p>\n<h3>Electric mountain bike motors</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bosch's latest Performance CX motor on the Overvolt GLP2 full suspension mountain ebike\" title=\"Lapierre Overvolt GLP2 Team review 10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bosch, Shimano and Yamaha motors are popular for electric mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mathieu Echeverri / Lapierre</i></span></div>\n<p>Popular choices for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/best-electric-mountain-bike-motor/\">electric mountain bike motors</a> are Bosch, Shimano Steps and Yamaha, while Fazua’s lightweight motor is increasingly making an appearance on weight-focused bikes.</p>\n<p>Bosch Performance Line CX motors provide 600Wh peak power and 85Nm of torque for fuss-free climbing. There’s a natural ride feel and good battery management that gets impressive range out of the system’s battery.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s Steps E-8000 and E-7000 systems are still found on some eMTBs, although they’ve started to show their age, with lower power output and torque than newer rivals. Its smaller batteries give you less range too, but still boast low weight and a compact design, along with the ability to tune the output.</p>\n<p>However, Shimano has added the EP8 motor to its range. This boosts torque to 85Nm while reducing weight by around 200g, lowering pedalling drag, increasing range and lowering Q-Factor. The EP8’s launch coincided with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-du-ep800-motor/\">Shimano increasing battery capacity</a> to 630Wh. More and more, you’ll find it being specced on newer electric mountain bikes, including many of our picks above of the best electric mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Giant uses the Yamaha Syncdrive Pro motor on its e-MTBs. Its Smart Assist mode uses an array of six sensors, including a gradient sensor, to work out how much power to deliver in any given situation.</p>\n<p>A popular choice on road-going ebikes, the Fazua motor system is to be found on some lighter-weight e-MTBs, such as the Lapierre eZesty. It’s lighter, less powerful and has a smaller battery. That means you typically need to put in more of your own pedalling effort, but it drops the bike’s weight down closer to non-assisted models. Plus, you can remove the battery completely and ride the bike without it.</p>\n<p>Specialized has its own motor units, which it specs on the majority of its electric bikes. Its Turbo Levo SL trail bike uses the low-torque SL 1.1 motor and a 320Wh battery for less assistance and lighter weight.</p>\n<h3>Electric mountain bike battery capacity</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL range extender\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL range extender\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some bikes allow range to be extended with an additional battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To get you up hills, produce enough power and provide adequate range, most electric mountain bikes will have battery capacities of around 500Wh to 700Wh.</p>\n<p>An internal battery in the down tube makes for clean lines, but there are also e-MTBs with external batteries. These typically lower the weight and, in models such as the Lapierre Overvolt, mean the battery can be placed lower and more centrally.</p>\n<p>But, as mentioned above, e-MTBs with smaller-capacity batteries down to 250Wh are appearing. These trade a more limited range for lighter weight and the potential for improved handling.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e766982d2ba4287ee03bf8260d02a55dde4af1864b3969d9361af35a55849be0","category":"Cycling"}
