That brings up a popup that shows the version of macOS installed and the storage space taken up by ‌Apple Intelligence‌ and it's the same way that System Settings works in the current release version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a>, 15.3.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is possible that the missing ‌Apple Intelligence‌ storage feature in the earlier macOS 15.4 beta was a bug. Users who had System Integrity Protection (SIP) disabled were able to see the information without issue, and Apple appeared to have made the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ storage assets unavailable to anyone with SIP enabled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor reference, SIP protects the Mac by preventing unauthorized code from being run, and it can only be turned off in Recovery Mode. Disabling SIP is typically only used by developers testing apps, and most users always have it on. Given that Apple returned the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ storage space listing to all users, it was perhaps something unintentional, though it remains unclear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that ‌Apple Intelligence‌ <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115\">can consume</a> up to 7GB of storage space on a Mac, though it appears to be taking up more space on some Macs in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.4. ‌Apple Intelligence‌ requires dedicated storage space because it downloads machine learning models and assets to Apple devices so that some functions can be run locally.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisabling ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is the only way to keep the feature from using up space on a Mac.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-intelligence-storage-space-macos-15-4/\">Apple No Longer Hiding Apple Intelligence Storage Space Info in macOS 15.4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-no-longer-hiding-apple-intelligence-storage-space-info-in-macos-15-4.2453352/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"77a1e4ea5cfe565a3c758f72a4175ebf2e9884912920651ece2b82f9de4e4eb5","category":"Apple"}
