Most surprising was probably the Tailfin R&amp;D Division rackless saddle bag, a big shift from their iconic rear aero pack &amp; rack solution. But just as interesting was a new Tailfin cage mounting solution and a tweaked toptube bag design. Plus, Josh raced Traka on a slightly updated pair of aero carbon Hunt wheels, tweaked for adventure racers…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tailfin R&amp;D Division prototype rackless bikepacking saddlebag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin R&amp;D Division ultralight prototype rackless bikepacking saddle bag on Josh Ibbet's Mason Bokeh gravel bike at Traka, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_non-driveside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This prototype saddle pack looks quite similar in layout to many rackless bikepacking saddlebags we’ve seen from several different manufacturers. Of course, Tailfin is most known for their light &amp; aero pannier racks that attach to your rear axle and seatpost for stability. But for riding with less gear, sometimes those racks can be overkill. And so it looks like Tailfin is developing an ultralight solution for those cases.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_attachment-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_attachment-detail-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin R&amp;D Division prototype rackless bikepacking saddle bag, attachment detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_attachment-detail-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_attachment-detail-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_attachment-detail-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_attachment-detail-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_attachment-detail.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_mount-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_mount-detail-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin R&amp;D Division prototype rackless bikepacking saddle bag, mount detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_mount-detail-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_mount-detail-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_mount-detail-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_mount-detail-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag_mount-detail.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Labeled as a Tailfin R&amp;D Division prototype, this simplified saddle pack features a thicker, more structured black fabric for the lower portion of the bag that contacts the saddle and seatpost. And then, the upper portion of the bag appears to be a much thinner, lighter, and maybe even translucent ripstop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attachment to the bike takes cues from Tailfins existing toptube or on-frame bags. Structured, rubberized feet sit between the bag, seatpost, and seatpost rails, providing a solid point to secure the bags with Tailfin’s stretchy TPU (<em>Voile-like</em>) straps.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin R&amp;D Division prototype ultralight rackless bikepacking saddle bag on Josh Ibbet's Mason Bokeh gravel bike at Traka\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-RD-Division-prototype-rackless-bikepacking-saddle-bag-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One longer strap secured the bag to Josh’s saddle rails, allowing him to cinch down the most likely light and puffy extra clothing he would have been carrying inside in case of changing weather conditions during longer ultra-distance racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the material itself, the prototype saddle pack utilizes a conventional rolltop layout for adjustable volume. And it features an attachment loop on top, presumably to either secure a taillight when fully rolled down, or to attach some lightweight gear to the top of the bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tailfin prototype cage mount &amp; updated toptube bag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin prototype strap-on cage mount, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-strap-on-cage-mount-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the R&amp;D Division ultralight saddle pack, his Mason Bokeh also had an extra bottle cage installed on top of the toptube, just in front of the seatpost. The Bokeh already fits 2 full-size bottles inside the main triangle with a partial frame bag installed, and can run an additional cage under the downtube. But with the threat of hot and muddy conditions looming, adding an extra bottle on top of the toptube behind the rider’s legs meant easy-access to water, and likely a cleaner bottle cap, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin prototype strap-on cage mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototype Tailfin cage mount looks to be 2 pieces – a main plastic body on top of a rubber foot that adapts to the frame tube shape for maximum grip &amp; stability. Then a couple more of Tailfin’s strong TPU straps secure it in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several strap slots available. And Josh manages to share the forward-most slot with his Tailfin partial frame bag. Paired with a Wolf Tooth cage that offers plenty of mounting holes, Josh was able to position the cage almost all the way against his seatpost (without it touching) and it held the full-size bottle securely over the rough Traka 200k gravel racecourse.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin prototype cage mount &amp; updated toptube bag on Josh Ibbet's Mason gravel bike at Traka\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-cage-mount-and-updated-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One last Tailfin R&amp;D Division prototype is this slightly modified toptube bag. It looks to use the same ultralight ripstop fabric as the top of the prototype reckless saddle pack, instead of the heavy-duty fabric of Tailfin’s standard bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin prototype updated toptube bag details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tailfin-prototype-toptube-bag-on-Josh-Ibbet-gravel-bike-at-Traka_mesh-pocket-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what’s really new here is the addition of a wrap-around mesh external pocket not included on the standard existing bags. Especially important at a race like the Traka where racers have to write their race number on all of their ride nutrition, this looks like a solution to easily stash your trash while racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://Tailfin.cc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tailfin.cc</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hunt 40 Limitless Adventure Gravel Aero wheelset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
