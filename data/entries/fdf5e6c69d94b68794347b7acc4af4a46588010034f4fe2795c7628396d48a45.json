{"title":"Israel Planted Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Officials Say","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html","date":1726615115000,"content":"\n<p>Sheera Frenkel and Ronen Bergman, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Israel carried out its operation against Hezbollah on Tuesday by\nhiding explosive material within a new batch of Taiwanese-made\npagers imported into Lebanon, according to American and other\nofficials briefed on the operation.</p>\n\n<p>The pagers, which Hezbollah had ordered from Gold Apollo in\nTaiwan, had been tampered with before they reached Lebanon,\naccording to some of the officials. Most were the company’s AP924\nmodel, though three other Gold Apollo models were also included in\nthe shipment.</p>\n\n<p>The explosive material, as little as one to two ounces, was\nimplanted next to the battery in each pager, two of the officials\nsaid. A switch was also embedded that could be triggered remotely\nto detonate the explosives.</p>\n\n<p>At 3:30 p.m. in Lebanon, the pagers received a message that\nappeared as though it was coming from Hezbollah’s leadership, two\nof the officials said. Instead, the message activated the\nexplosives. Lebanon’s health minister told state media at least\nnine people were killed and more than 2,800 injured.</p>\n\n<p>The devices were programmed to beep for several seconds before\nexploding, according to three of the officials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hezbollah leadership had ordered its members to forgo modern phones for security reasons, convinced (probably correctly) that Israeli intelligence was able to track them. So they switched to decades-old pagers. But Israel seemingly infiltrated the supply chain of Gold Apollo and boobytrapped the pagers.</p>\n\n<p>In the initial pandemonium after the attack was triggered, there was speculation that, somehow, it was simply the batteries that exploded. But batteries — especially the AAA batteries these pagers use — don’t explode with that much force:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Independent cybersecurity experts who have studied footage of the\nattacks said it was clear that the strength and speed of the\nexplosions were caused by a type of explosive material.</p>\n\n<p>“These pagers were likely modified in some way to cause these\ntypes of explosions — the size and strength of the explosion\nindicates it was not just the battery,” said Mikko Hypponen, a\nresearch specialist at the software company WithSecure and a\ncybercrime adviser to Europol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This whole operation sounds like it would make for a great movie.</p>\n\n<p>(Hypponen, whom I believe I met, at least once, at a long-ago Macworld Expo or WWDC, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/08/flashback-need-to-know\">was previously referenced on DF in 2012</a> regarding a widespread Mac Trojan horse.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/17/israel-hezbollah-explosive-pagers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fdf5e6c69d94b68794347b7acc4af4a46588010034f4fe2795c7628396d48a45","category":"Tech"}
