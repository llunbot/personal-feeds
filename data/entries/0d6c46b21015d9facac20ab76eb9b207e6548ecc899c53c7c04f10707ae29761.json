Both screens have a 120Hz refresh rate. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBased on details from Blass, the device is 5.5\" tall by 3.1\" wide by 0.5\" thin when folded (139.7mm x 79.5mm x 12.1mm) and 5.5\" x 6.2\" x 0.2\" (139.7mm x 158.7mm x 5.2mm) when unfolded. That should make the device able to fit easily in a pocket when folded. The Fold is powered by Google's Tensor G2 chip and a dedicated Titan M2 security co-processor, and comes with 12GB of RAM as well as 256GB or 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/pixel-fold2.jpg\" alt width=\"2400\" height=\"2116\" />\r<br />\nThe Fold's outer cameras are comprised of 48MP main, 10.8MP ultra-wide, and 10.8MP Dual Pixel telephoto lenses, while the inner camera is an 8MP lens. The Fold also weighs 283 grams, is IPX8 water resistant, and will have a 4,821mAh battery that is able to last for up to 24 hours. Color options are listed as Obsidian and Porcelain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Pixel Fold will be introduced at Google I/O on May 10, and Google plans to market it as a device with the \"most durable hinge\" on a foldable smartphone, a claim that should prove particularly apropos given recent reports emerging of <a href=\"http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=113610\">hinge problems across Samsung's foldable Z phone line</a>. The device is expected to be priced from around $1,700, which is in line with Samsung's pricing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the Pixel Fold becoming available in June, Google will beat Apple to the foldable smartphone market. There are rumors that Apple has been experimenting with foldable iPhones, but the company could actually introduce the technology in the iPad first.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/pixel-fold1.jpg\" alt width=\"2400\" height=\"2134\" />\r<br />\nAt the current time, there is no solid word on just when Apple might introduce its first foldable iPhone, but analysts have suggested it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/\">won't come until 2025 at the earliest</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-pixel/\">Google Pixel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/pixel-fold-marketing-images-leak/\">Google Pixel Fold Marketing Images and Specs Leak Ahead of June Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-pixel-fold-marketing-images-and-specs-leak-ahead-of-june-launch.2388420/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d6c46b21015d9facac20ab76eb9b207e6548ecc899c53c7c04f10707ae29761","category":"Apple"}
