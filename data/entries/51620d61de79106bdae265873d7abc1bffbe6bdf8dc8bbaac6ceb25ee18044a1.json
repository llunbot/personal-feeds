Apple no longer includes a power adapter in the box with the Apple Watch, so users will need to provide their own.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212769\">new support document</a> published today just as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/14/apple-watch-series-7-australia-new-zealand/\">first Apple Watch Series 7 orders have started arriving</a>, Apple reveals that any of its USB-C power adapters rated at 18 watts or higher will support fast charging on the new watch. In addition, third-party USB-C adapters rated at 5 watts or higher will allow for fast charging as long as they support the USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) protocol.<blockquote>Fast charging requires an Apple USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Cable. This cable has aluminum around the magnetic charger and a USB-C connector.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou also need one of these power adapters:\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li>Apple 18W, 20W, 29W, 30W, 61W, 87W, or 96W USB-C Power Adapter</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>A comparable third-party USB-C power adapter that supports USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) of 5W or greater</li></ul></blockquote>Apple says that fast charging is not available in Argentina, India, or Vietnam, but the company has not offered a reason for this limitation.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/14/apple-watch-series-7-fast-charge-adapter/\">Apple Watch Series 7 Fast Charging Requires 5W or Greater USB-C PD Adapter</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-requires-5w-or-greater-usb-c-pd-adapter.2317006/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LV63d7LNaso:_WXPLJUkZbE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LV63d7LNaso:_WXPLJUkZbE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LV63d7LNaso\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51620d61de79106bdae265873d7abc1bffbe6bdf8dc8bbaac6ceb25ee18044a1","category":"Apple"}
