Two years later, Schleck was retroactively awarded the win after Contador was banned for doping, but how does that sit with the 39-year-old Luxembourger today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a wonderfully candid chat, Schleck explains his thoughts then and now, plus what it meant to race with his brother, his special bond with teammates forged off the road, the doping scene in the early 2000s, his stunning 2009 Tour and his bittersweet experience in 2011, the injuries that led to retirement, the personal crisis he faced once he hung up his wheels, and what he really thinks about Bjarne Riis, Johan Bruyneel, Chris Froome and, of course, Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Andy Schleck runs several successful cycling shops in Luxembourg and is ambassador for the <a href=\"https://kitzbueheler-radmarathon.at/?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Kitzbüheler Radmarathon</a>, a gruelling sportive that takes place in Austria in September 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/121-andy-schleck-chaingate-contador-bruyneel-doping-and-the-\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 121 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did you know Cyclist is also stunning monthly print magazine?
