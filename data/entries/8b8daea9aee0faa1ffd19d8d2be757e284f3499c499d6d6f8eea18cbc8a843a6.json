That's a lot of launches. If you're doing modifications and doing them one by one, that's a lot of work. We've been talking to SpaceX constantly around the clock, coming together and trying to figure out how do we do this. We're invested with the company, and so we'll work with them to get them back going as soon as they can.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005103#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005103&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8b8daea9aee0faa1ffd19d8d2be757e284f3499c499d6d6f8eea18cbc8a843a6","category":"Tech"}
