For the most part, there’s nothing special you need to do for the spatial web. It’s truly Safari, with the same WebKit engine and its extensive support for web standards.</p>\n<p>You can see how Safari in visionOS works by watching the Apple Vision Pro introduction at the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/101/?time=4851\">WWDC23 Keynote</a> or the session <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10279/\">Meet Safari for spatial computing</a>. If you don’t have your own Apple Vision Pro, and you want to experience what it’s like in person, you can book a free demo of Apple Vision Pro at your <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/\">local Apple Store</a> (in available regions).</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how to use Safari’s suite of developer tools to test, inspect, and debug your site. First, you’ll learn how to use Safari developer tools with the visionOS simulator. Then, you’ll get a walkthrough of pairing Safari and Web Inspector on your Mac with Apple Vision Pro. These instructions work with for visionOS 1.2 and visionOS 2 so you can debug even if you do not have an Apple developer account.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><a name=\"develop-with-the-visionos-simulator\"></a>Develop with the visionOS simulator</h2>\n<p>The Mac is a powerful machine — powerful enough to run macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS, and iPadOS at the same time. It’s here where app developers work on their apps, write code, and test their code in the appropriate Simulator.</p>\n<figure><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1241\" src=\"https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/simulators.webp\" alt=\"iPhone simulator showing 9:41, watchOS simulator showing 9:41, and a visionOS simulator\" srcset=\"https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/simulators.webp 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/simulators-300x194.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/simulators-1024x662.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/simulators-768x496.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/simulators-1536x993.webp 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>You can test the website you are building in Safari inside Simulator on macOS. This lets you develop the site on your Mac, using your full development environment, with your favorite IDE, Terminal, and more. When you’re ready to test, use Web Inspector on Mac to inspect web pages running in its simulator.</p>\n<figure><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1241\" src=\"https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/inspecting-visionos-simulator-light.webp\" alt=\"Web Inspector to the left of a visionOS simulator\" srcset=\"https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/inspecting-visionos-simulator-light.webp 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/inspecting-visionos-simulator-light-300x194.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/inspecting-visionos-simulator-light-1024x662.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/inspecting-visionos-simulator-light-768x496.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/inspecting-visionos-simulator-light-1536x993.webp 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>At WWDC24, Apple announced visionOS 2 beta <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com\">available now</a> to developers with an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/\">Apple Developer Program membership</a>. Xcode 16 beta includes the visionOS 2 beta simulator with <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/15443/news-from-wwdc24-webkit-in-safari-18-beta/\">Safari 18 beta</a>. Or test in visionOS 1.2 with <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/15383/webkit-features-in-safari-17-5/\">Safari 17.5</a> by downloading Xcode 15 and installing its simulator.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"get-setup\"></a>Get setup</h3>\n<p>Here’s how to get started using the visionOS simulator:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835\">Xcode 15</a> from the Mac App Store. (It’s free.) Or download Xcode 15 or Xcode 16 beta from the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode website</a>.</li>\n<li>Open Xcode. When asked which platforms you would like to develop for, enable visionOS.

If you’re using visionOS 1.2 in Apple Vision Pro or in the visionOS simulator on your Mac, you can still experience WebXR by turning on support for the testable version. You can also preview other new features like the <code>&lt;model&gt;</code> element.</p>\n<p>To enable support for WebXR or the <code>&lt;model&gt;</code> element, from the the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/open-home-view-devf42afa74a/visionos\">Home View</a>, go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Safari &gt; Advanced &gt; Feature Flags and enable the feature flags for “HTML  element” or “WebXR”.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><a name=\"develop-with-apple-vision-pro\"></a>Develop with Apple Vision Pro</h2>\n<p>Apple Vision Pro is a great place to work on a website.
