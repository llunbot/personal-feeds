Gurman also revealed a new detail: the more customizable Control Center will allow for controls to be spread across multiple pages for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also reiterated that the revamped Control Center will include a new music widget. We have learned that the widget will likely span the full width of Control Center, and include more visual elements like album art in its default view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs previously reported, more customization is also expected for the Home Screen on iOS 18. Two notable changes have been rumored, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/\">ability to place icons anywhere on the Home Screen</a>, and the option to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/ios-18-to-allow-users-to-recolor-app-icons/\">change the color of app icons</a> so that they all match. For example, Gurman said all finance-related app icons could be set to green. Hopefully black is also an option, which could allow for a Dark Mode of sorts on the Home Screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first beta of iOS 18 should be available immediately after the WWDC keynote, and the update will likely be widely released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/\">Control Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/ios-18-control-center-multiple-pages-rumor/\">Rumor: iOS 18's Revamped Control Center Will Allow for Multiple Pages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-ios-18s-revamped-control-center-will-allow-for-multiple-pages.2428384/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c8892dfcbe6b6961408c5809aae140da1b8d345f190bd511c02240c390b06aea","category":"Apple"}
