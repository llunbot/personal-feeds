AirPods Beanies come just after the 20th anniversary of the iPod, and will be appealing to iPod fans.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/airpods-beanies-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple began selling iPod Socks in 2004, offering a set of six for $29. When they were introduced, Steve Jobs jokingly referred to them as a \"revolutionary new product\" and they became a favorite of Apple users as they were able to fit several devices, even early iPhones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/airpods-beanies-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAirPods Beanies feature a two-tone knit design, similar to the iPod Sock, and they're available in four pastel colors: Glacier, Peach, Indigo, and Sage. The Beanies are sized to fit all AirPods models, including the original AirPods, AirPods 2, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/airpods-beanies-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Beanies are close to identical to the original iPod Socks, though they're shorter to fit the AirPods and come in a series of fresh colors. The Beanies can be slipped off for wireless charging purposes or when in use, and they offer protection for the AirPods while they're tucked in a bag or a pocket.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNative Union is selling the AirPods Beanies in a set of four for $19.99 and they can be purchased <a href=\"https://www.nativeunion.com/products/airpods-beanies\">from the Native Union website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/native-union/\">Native Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/26/native-union-airpods-beanies/\">Native Union Brings Back iPod Socks, But for AirPods</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/native-union-brings-back-ipod-socks-but-for-airpods.2319572/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Kum2fg9P_r0:_j9EOj8sj9E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Kum2fg9P_r0:_j9EOj8sj9E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Kum2fg9P_r0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a4ad649e2dcf734e780d2b13dd005dce34c165091bb4cd52b82491deb55309a","category":"Apple"}
