It occurred in the Welsh town of Dinas Mawddwy while filming the third installment to his <em>The Ridge Line</em> and <em><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/04/02/must-watch-gee-atherton-goes-large-to-extra-large-in-the-slate-line/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Slate Line</a></em> series.</p><p>On July 16, just 3 weeks after the potentially life-changing accident, the Red Bull athlete took to YouTube with a serious but uplifting progress note.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QcmBZfonoQ\" width=\"704\" height=\"371\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" ezoid=\"0.3433085118983661\"></iframe></p><p>Aerial footage of the event (which begins at the 1:01 mark in the clip above) shows Atherton as he “tumbled, ragdolled” down 100 feet of the steep, slate-laden hillside. In all,&nbsp; the athlete sustained several spectacular injuries: a shattered femur, fractured radius and ulnar (forearm), fractures to multiple ribs, a broken nose and eye socket, a collapsed lung, and — not surprisingly — one hell of a concussion.</p><h2>Gee Atherton, Determination Incarnate</h2><p>Atherton delivers his recount of the incident in a somber but positive tone. Halfway through the video he notes, “the injuries — though they’re <em>massive</em>, and there is a big list of them — are already healing well…I’ve been walking without the crutches already, we’ve started physio in the gym. The leg can take some weight; the arm has got some strength in it. Everything, every day, is getting a little bit better.”</p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ6VujwLO8p/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\"></blockquote><p>Atherton’s parting statements are confident and determined: “you have to be willing to take the consequences when it goes wrong…take the recovery time. It’s difficult, but you know that going in…That’s just how it works. I feel I’ve been lucky with these injuries — it could have been a lot worse. And I’ll be back.”</p><p>Learn more about Gee’s accomplishments <a href=\"https://www.redbull.com/us-en/athlete/gee-atherton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, and follow his recovery on his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gee_atherton/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram profile</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"Jilli Cluff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1acaebce57bc92d4f94fc419be24a9b765fbef4588ca174c91888030cb87200f","category":"Cycling"}
