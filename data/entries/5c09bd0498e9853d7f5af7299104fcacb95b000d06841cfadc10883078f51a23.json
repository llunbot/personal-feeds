However, one critical issue remains unresolved before the large booster can lift off.</p>\n<p>This final hurdle involves modifications to the rocket's Centaur V upper stage, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/ula-continues-investigation-of-centaur-stage-anomaly/\">which exploded</a> during a test at the end of March. On Tuesday, the chief executive of Vulcan manufacturer United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1668314430785097728\">wrote on Twitter</a> that a root cause of the failure had been identified, and the investigation has been concluded.</p>\n<p>As part of their recent updates, neither Bruno nor United Launch Alliance established a new target launch date. Two sources indicated to Ars, however, that this flight likely would not occur before the fourth quarter of this year due to additional needed work.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947706#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947706&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5c09bd0498e9853d7f5af7299104fcacb95b000d06841cfadc10883078f51a23","category":"Tech"}
