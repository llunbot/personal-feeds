The Euclid telescope, named for the ancient Greek mathematician, will observe billions of galaxies during its six-year survey of the sky, measuring their shapes and positions going back 10 billion years, more than 70 percent of cosmic history.</p>\n<p>Led by the European Space Agency, the Euclid mission has the ambitious goal of helping astronomers and cosmologists learn about the properties and influence of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/an-astrophysicist-explains-the-often-misunderstood-nature-of-dark-energy/\">dark matter and dark energy</a>, which are thought to make up about 95 percent of the Universe. The rest of the cosmos is made of regular atoms and molecules that we can see and touch.</p>\n<h2>Stumbling in the dark</h2>\n<p>“To highlight the challenge we face, I would like to give the analogy: It’s very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there’s no cat,” said Henk Hoekstra, a professor and cosmologist at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. “That’s a little bit of the situation we find ourselves in because we have these observations … But we lack a good theory. So far, nobody has come up with a good explanation for dark matter or dark energy.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951456#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951456&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ef01badc8077e35470cd67824c13cc2d36e2fcf3908aff34ba80f82376c6dad1","category":"Tech"}
