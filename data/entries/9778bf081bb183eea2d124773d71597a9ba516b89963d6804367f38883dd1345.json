Keep a close eye on what you’re perusing, however, because Apple is still selling M1 and Intel Mac minis, and the website doesn’t offer an easy way to filter the product listing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has a rigorous process for the products it sells in the refurbished store. The company makes repairs and replaces parts so that the devices are just as good as new ones. As with new Apple products, refurbished devices have a one-year warranty, 90 days of tech support, and a 14-day return policy, and they are eligible for AppleCare coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, refurbished stock is limited, so if you can’t find what you’re looking for, come back later.
