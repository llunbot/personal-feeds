The full price range is as follows:\r<br />\n<ul><li>iPhone 15 Pro – 128GB - £999</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro – 256GB - £1,099</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro – 512GB - £1,299</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro – 1TB - £1,499</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max – 256GB - £1,199</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max – 512GB - £1,399</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max – 1TB - £1,599</li></ul>The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max is priced starting at £1,199, but that's only because Apple has eliminated the 128GB storage tier for that device. It now starts at 256GB, and £1,199 is the same price Apple charged for the 256GB iPhone 14 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPre-orders for the new ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro models will open on Friday, September 15, with shipping to begin on Friday, September 22.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-100-pound-cheaper-uk/\">iPhone 15 Pro £100 Cheaper in the UK Than Last Year's Equivalent Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-£100-cheaper-in-the-uk-than-last-years-equivalent-models.2401257/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d13f846bfe87d7840e7bd71509e50dd2fa80e9a354f7f95f36ad118291a75f54","category":"Apple"}
