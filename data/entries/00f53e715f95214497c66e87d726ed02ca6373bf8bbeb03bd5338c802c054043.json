The Texas law also requires platforms to provide clear paths to timely appeal censored content, and both laws require platforms to publicly disclose standards for when and why they censor users.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972299#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972299&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00f53e715f95214497c66e87d726ed02ca6373bf8bbeb03bd5338c802c054043","category":"Tech"}
