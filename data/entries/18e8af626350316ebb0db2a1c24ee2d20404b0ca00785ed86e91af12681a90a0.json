And, in the process, it's telling us something about what the planet's interior must be like, thanks in no small part to data obtained by hardware we landed in Mars' equatorial regions.</p>\n<p>That's the conclusion of a new modeling study that produces results that are broadly consistent with earlier work, although quite a bit more detailed. In the process, the work shows how it's possible to take data from radically different data sources and pull them together into a coherent picture.</p>\n<h2>Weighted down</h2>\n<p>While the crust of a planet is relatively solid, it bends and breaks in various ways under the strain of plate tectonics. It also flexes in response to ice. The long glacial period that preceded our current interglacial saw sheets of ice that pressed the crust down into the mantle under their difficult-to-conceive weight. With the ice gone, the crust is slowly rising again, in a process called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound\">glacial isostatic rebound</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/mars-polar-ice-cap-is-slowly-pushing-its-north-pole-inward/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/mars-polar-ice-cap-is-slowly-pushing-its-north-pole-inward/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"18e8af626350316ebb0db2a1c24ee2d20404b0ca00785ed86e91af12681a90a0","category":"Tech"}
