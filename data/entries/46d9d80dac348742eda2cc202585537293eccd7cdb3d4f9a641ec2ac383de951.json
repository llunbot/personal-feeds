The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2222047/apple-vision-pro-reviews-roundup.html\">first reviews are in</a> and they say the technology is unmatched, but there are still a few problems to work out and a lack of must-have software. We’ll have lots of impressions and our full review in the days following its release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Vision Pro is here! Apple’s “Spatial Computer” (read: mixed-reality headset) is the biggest attempt the company has ever made to move beyond the iPhone and Mac. The $3,499 device arrives in Apple Stores on Friday, February 2, but it’s unclear how much stock will be available for purchase. Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2214079/vision-pro-preorder-weekend-sales-180000-units-report.html\">already sold around 200,000 headsets</a>, according to estimates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">everything you need to know</a> about Apple Vision Pro. We’ll have continuing coverage throughout the month–impressions, reviews, articles on new spatial computing apps and experiences, and lots more, so stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t expect much else in the way of new hardware, but it’s possible that we get more information—and possibly an invitation—about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">a spring event</a> toward the end of February. Apple is expected to launch new iPads and an M3 MacBook Air at this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the OS updates in February will center around <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218208/ios-17-4-beta-eu-app-store-changes-features-install.html\">iOS 17.4</a>, which will allow third-party app distribution and payment processors in the EU, along with new emojis and a handful of other minor tweaks like podcast transcripts. Updates to macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and tvOS will come along with the big iOS changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development community <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2220841/app-store-fees-maliciious-compliance-vision-pro.html\">doesn’t seem particularly happy</a> with Apple’s new terms in the EU, so they might even change before they go into effect. To comply with EU regulations Apple will need to have iOS 17.4 out before March 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 17.4:</strong> The big change here is allowing app distribution outside the app store and payment processors other than Apple, but only in the EU, but there are a few other tweaks as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>visionOS 1.1?:</strong> The first version of visionOS comes loaded on the Apple Vision Pro, and a small <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214070&amp;xcust=1-1-2222298-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">1.0.2</a> update should be waiting for new customers if it hasn’t been installed already. But we wouldn’t be surprised to see a few other new visionOS releases throughout the month, fixing critical bugs and the like. Will Apple make a visionOS 1.1 beta available? Will we get more than just bug fixes and security updates? Who knows, it’s a brave new world!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in February.
