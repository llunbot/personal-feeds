The feature allows users to interact with Gemini through voice commands on their Android devices. That's notable because competitor OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode feature of ChatGPT, which is similar to Gemini Live, has not yet fully shipped.</p>\n\n<p>Google unveiled Gemini Live during its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-phones-the-gemini-ai-stuff-reviewed/\">Pixel 9 launch event</a> last month. Initially, the feature was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers, but now it's accessible to anyone using the Gemini app or its overlay on Android.</p>\n<p>Gemini Live enablesÂ users to ask questions aloud and even interrupt the AI's responses mid-sentence. Users can choose from several voice options for Gemini's responses, adding a level of customization to the interaction.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049707#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049707&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"20fa4ca8e6cab39e5db48d3874eeabfd5173b4dbd5b643d707c7ec8c8716c6cf","category":"Tech"}
