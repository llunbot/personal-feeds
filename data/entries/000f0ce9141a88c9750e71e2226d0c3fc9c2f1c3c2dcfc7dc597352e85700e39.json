The first four minutes of the video cover Apple Intelligence, so skip to 4:40 if you just want to watch the bit about the ‌iMac‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has three videos to share this week, so we can expect additional M4 Mac product announcements on Tuesday and Wednesday. We are also expecting Apple to release new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/\">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a> models with a new design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPricing on the new ‌iMac‌ starts at $1,299, and pre-orders began today. A launch will follow on November 8.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-m4-imac-keynote/\">Watch Apple's Full 10-Minute M4 iMac Keynote</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watch-apples-full-10-minute-m4-imac-keynote.2441150/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"000f0ce9141a88c9750e71e2226d0c3fc9c2f1c3c2dcfc7dc597352e85700e39","category":"Apple"}
