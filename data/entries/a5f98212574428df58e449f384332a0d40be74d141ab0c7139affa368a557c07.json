Intense just launched what they’re calling the <a href=\"https://intensecycles.com/pages/frame-first-dealer\" target=\"_blank\">Frame First Program</a>. It’s an IBD program that’s geared towards helping the Independent Bicycle Dealers (IBD) with the challenges they’ve been facing lately. Intense says the program is designed to “empower the IBD and disrupt the broken industry model”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame First Program</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike.webp\" alt=\"Intense Cycles Frame First Program without bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Intense Cycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It works like this: Intense places the dealer at the center of the bike purchase journey. It’s there that the dealer can create value for the riders while generating cash flow-positive margins without the inventory risk. Intense will be working with Quality Bicycle Products (QBP) to offer pre-configured build kits for Intense frames. This, in turn, will allow the dealer to provide a customizable experience for their customers while not bearing the heavy inventory burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that as products change and new ones are introduced, dealers won’t be stuck with bikes built with old components that consumers no longer want. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be some exclusive dealer perks as well…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>50k Components</strong><br />Dealers will be unlocking a catalog of 50,000 unique components, giving them the power to fine-tune every detail. This can optimize performance and allow them to craft a bike that’s one of a kind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>300 Component Brands</strong><br />There will be 300 renowned and 70 exclusive component brands at the dealer’s fingertips. The dealer will be able to push familiar favorites or experiment with new combinations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Value</strong><br />With this new dealer-centric business model, building a custom bike doesn’t have to break the bank, offering customizations at no additional cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Word From Intense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>We believe strongly that the current bike industry model is broken and that the IBD is the unfortunate recipient of that brokenness,</em>” said Mike Carr, INTENSE Vice President of Sales and Marketing. “<em>The new INTENSE Frame First Program solves some of the biggest challenges that dealers face today while enhancing the value of the IBD to the rider. Having a strong working partnership with Quality Bicycle Products is paramount to enabling the success and efficiency of this program for dealers</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let’s Hear from QBP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Retailers know their customers best and, utilizing our Custom Build Kits, can efficiently get exactly what they need to deliver the ultimate purchase experience for every rider who wants a custom INTENSE bike,</em>” said Bill Schouman, QBP Vice President of Sales. “<em>We stock the products and brands that consumers want, and they’re available with reliable, just-in-time delivery to our retail partners exactly when they need it</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Dealers Can Participate</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-with-bike.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-with-bike.webp\" alt=\"Intense Cycles Frame First Program with bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-with-bike.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-with-bike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-with-bike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-with-bike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-with-bike-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step One:</strong> <br /><em>Become a dealer to gain access to the Intense Cycles B2B portal where they can purchase frames right off the website.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Step Two:</strong><br /><em>Dealers can optimize their customers’ builds by completing the setup sheet with their</em> <em>biometrics and component specifications.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Step Three:</strong><br /><em>Dealers order a frame directly from Intense Cycles and source the components from QBP, then assemble everything in the shop. </em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hit the link below for more information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://intensecycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IntenseCycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/intense-frame-first-custom-bike-program-dealers/\">Intense Aims to Fix Bike Industry w/ Dealer-Centric Frame First Custom Program</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a5f98212574428df58e449f384332a0d40be74d141ab0c7139affa368a557c07","category":"Cycling"}
