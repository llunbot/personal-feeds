When it comes to tubeless sealant, the longer it lasts the more maintenance it could save you. I’ve been testing Orange Seal’s Endurance sealant since last fall and can confirm mine has lasted well beyond the company’s claims, even with a few blunders along the way.</p><p>My plan was to leave the Endurance sealant in my wheel over the winter, then see how it handled some riding the following spring. I quickly realized winter storage might present some issues, and it did! However, that made for a tough test and ultimately I was won over by the Endurance sealant’s ability to remain effective for a long, long time.</p><h2>Endurance Sealant Installation Notes:</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling.jpg\" alt=\"Orange Seal Endurance sealant, filling with hose\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172514/Endurance-seal-filling-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>I received one <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Forange-seal-endurance-tubeless-sealant-with-twist-lock-applicator&amp;ctc=BRPROutdoorBiking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8oz</a> bottle of Endurance sealant with the dipstick/injector hose kit and one refill bottle.

I put my pump on the valve, gave it two or three strokes, and everything looked fine. Soon afterward I found out my valve had gummed up with sealant and let almost all the pressure out of the tire again! The bead was still completely stuck to the rim, and once the valve was cleaned out and the tire re-inflated, it held air once more. From that point on the tire has remained properly sealed, surviving a few Spring nights that dipped <em>slightly</em> below 0° and reliably holding air throughout the entire summer (while my bike sadly sat in storage due to a broken wrist).</p><p>Unfortunately, I have not had any punctures on-trail with the Endurance sealant installed, so while I can say it’s definitely long-lasting I can’t say much about its hole-filling capabilities. Orange Seal claims it will seal punctures up to 1/8” and slices up to 1/2” long.</p><h3>The Dipstick:</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick.jpg\" alt=\"Orange Seal Endurance sealant, dipstick\" width=\"800\" height=\"484\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-297x180.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-120x73.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-768x465.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-696x421.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-694x420.jpg 694w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-297x180.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-120x73.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-768x465.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-696x421.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172509/Endurance-seal-dipstick-694x420.jpg 694w\"></a></strong>I learned one lesson about Orange Seals’ dipstick – You need to have your bike in a work stand (or the wheel suspended somehow) for it to be useful. I tried checking my sealant with my bike on the ground, hoping if I was careful the tire would hold its shape, but of course, the airless tire just laid flat making it impossible to determine my sealant level! If you do have your bike in a work stand the dipstick could indicate whether you need a top-up or not, which you could easily then do without removing the tire. There are no ‘OK’ and ‘Fill’ marks on the dipstick, but it will give you some idea of how much sealant is in your tire.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Orange Seal Endurance sealant, Steve Fisher riding\" width=\"800\" height=\"537\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-297x199.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-120x81.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-768x516.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-696x467.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-626x420.jpg 626w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-297x199.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-120x81.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-768x516.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-696x467.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/18172521/Endurance-seal-SF-riding-626x420.jpg 626w\"></a></p><p>After many months and a few hiccups, I am impressed with the fact that despite being exposed to air or losing almost all tire pressure multiple times I was able to carry on using the same sealant with no top-ups.
