Not only that, but barring a false start with an electric take on the Three Wheeler, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/03/hi-tech-lo-fi-3-wheel-electric-vehicle-thrills-morgans-new-ev3/\">the EV3</a>, it's all gas, all the time. Perhaps that won't be the case forever, as it has revealed its latest development vehicle, XP-1: a Super 3 with an electric heart.</p>\n<p>Where the production Super 3 has a 1.5 L Ford three-cylinder engine under the hood, XP-1 gets a 33 kWh battery pack hooked up to a 136 hp (100 kW) 251 lb-ft (340 Nm) electric motor that sits in the transmission tunnel. It weighs 132 lbs (60 kg) more than the gas car and comes with <em>a lot</em> more torque.</p>\n<p>A happy side effect of that weight is a real-world economy of about 4 miles/kWh (15.5 kWh/100 km), giving a non-homologated range of roughly 132 miles/212 km). Oh, and Morgan has thrown in fast charging—up to 50 kW—so it can get itself a full charge in less than an hour.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988941#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988941&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32bb65282eeec57947751688aff577471077ec49a4b381335751a27b2bc8c601","category":"Tech"}
