Today, Intel <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/press-kit-architecture-day-2021.html#gs.9cifm8\">provided a few additional details on Arc</a>, its underlying Xe-HPG architecture, its graphics drivers, and the \"XeSS\" upscaling technology that will work with both Intel's GPUs as well as GPUs from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/nvidia/\">Nvidia</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/amd/\">AMD</a>.</p>\n<p>The HPG in Xe-HPG stands for \"high-performance gaming,\" and it builds on the Xe-LP (\"low-power\") graphics tech included in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/intel-is-getting-serious-about-xe-gpus-laptop-desktop-and-datacenter/\">Intel's 11th-generation Tiger Lake laptop processors</a> and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/intel-enters-the-laptop-discrete-gpu-market-with-xe-max/\">low-end DG1 dedicated GPU</a>. At a high level, Xe-HPG will support all of the features in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/directx-12-ultimate-brings-xbox-series-x-features-to-pc-gaming/\">DirectX 12 Ultimate</a>, just like Nvidia's RTX 2000- and 3000-series GPUs and AMD's RDNA2-based Radeon RX 6000-series cards. This includes, most notably, support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing, <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/variable-rate-shading-a-scalpel-in-a-world-of-sledgehammers/\">variable rate shading</a>, and <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/coming-to-directx-12-mesh-shaders-and-amplification-shaders-reinventing-the-geometry-pipeline/\">mesh shaders</a>.</p>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/intel-architecture-day-2021-presentation-97-980x551.jpeg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Intel is replacing the \"EU\" as its base GPU hardware measurement with the \"Xe-core,\" a mix of 16 vector engines, 16 matrix engines, some cache, and a few other elements.

The company is doing away with that terminology for Xe-HPG, replacing it instead with the concept of the \"Xe-core.\" Each Xe-core is composed of 16 vector engines and 16 matrix (or XMX) engines, as well as L1 cache and some other hardware. Four Xe-cores combine with ray-tracing units and other fixed-function hardware to form a \"render slice,\" which is the bare minimum any Xe-HPG GPU will need to function (along with L2 cache and a memory interface).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788686#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788686&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8adb74d5b43493377602ef4d7bbde7026af6b51c4a7be005eb9b48876f99db72","category":"Tech"}
