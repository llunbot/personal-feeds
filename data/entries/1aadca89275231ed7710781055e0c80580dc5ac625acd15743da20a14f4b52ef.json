It even has an aero water bottle and integrated aero storage box on the downtube, as often seen on modern triathlon bikes. That all bodes well for speed on straight, flat roads, but Orbea is confident this bike handles and climbs like a race bike too.</p>\n<p>While the old Orca Aero had semi-external cable routing, the new bike uses Orbea’s ICR system (Integrated Cable Routing) system (as seen on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/orbea-orca-omx-m10i-ltd-d-2020-review/\">Orca OMX</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/orbea-orca-omr-m20i-team-review/\">Orca OMR</a>), which routes the cables underneath the stem and into the headset, for a much cleaner looking front end.</p>\n<p>In a nod to practicality, the new Orca Aero also uses a non-integrated aero cockpit to maintain front end adjustability. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/narrow-handlebars/\">Handlebar widths</a> have also been narrowed by 2cm across the size range, in a further nod to aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<p>As expected, the new Orbea Orca is now only available with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a>. Hardly a surprise, perhaps, but no doubt some <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/save-the-rim-brake-stickers/\">die-hard rim brake fanatics</a> will be disappointed nevertheless. Our 2017 assurances that “<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/settle-down-your-rim-brakes-are-here-to-stay/\">rim brakes are here to stay</a>” seems woefully outdated now…</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>2022 Orbea Orca Aero: what you need to know</h2>\n<ul><li>The 2022 Orbea Orca Aero is a brand new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bike</a>, claimed to save 15 watts at 40kph versus the previous version</li>\n<li>Aero lessons learned from Orbea’s Ordu time trial bike have been applied to the new frameset</li>\n<li>All cables now route under the stem and into the frame at the headset</li>\n<li>The frameset is optimised for 25-28mm tyres, but has clearance for 30mm tyres</li>\n<li>A size 53cm frame is claimed to weigh 1,140g (unpainted), with top-spec Shimano or SRAM builds weighing 7.6kg</li>\n<li>Prices start at £3,999 / €3,999 / $4,499 for the Orca Aero M20LTD, which comes with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-ultegra-r8000-groupset-review/\">Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset</a> and Fulcrum alloy wheels</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea says the design philosophy behind the new Orca Aero is “perfect balance”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<h2>Perfect balance</h2>\n<p>Orbea says its design goal for the new Orca Aero was to find a “perfect balance” between aerodynamics, stiffness to weight, handling and ergonomics.</p>\n<p>It noted that improving one is often detrimental to the other – making tube shapes more aerodynamic typically comes with a weight or stiffness penalty, for example.</p>\n<p>Orbea believes it’s found the goldilocks zone with the new Orca Aero, saying it’s “the fastest aero road bike we have ever designed”.</p>\n<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>\n<p>The headline claim is that the new Orca Aero saves 15 watts at 40kph. Orbea also said the savings increase to 28 watts at 50kph, though that’s likely only relevant to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour</a> pros.</p>\n<p>Orbea says these figures are derived from real-world testing performed in a velodrome too, not just wind tunnel testing. The frameset tube shapes now visibly mimic those found on the Ordu time trial bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Orca Aero has been subject to extensive wind tunnel and real-world aero testing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>The headtube is wider and shorter due to the use of a standard fork and headset arrangement (the Ordu uses a hinge fork design), but, otherwise, it’s very reminiscent of a pure time trial bike.</p>\n<p>The top tube and chainstays are horizontal, for example, and there’s a cut-out in the downtube around the front wheel. The seat tube to seat stay cluster also wraps around the rear wheel to shield it from the wind.</p>\n<p>The updated fork is said to be specifically optimised for deep section aero wheels, given they’re now de rigueur for an aero road bike.</p>\n<p>The frameset is also claimed to be aerodynamically optimised for 25-28mm tyres, but there’s clearance for up to 30mm tyres if you need more comfort.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The integrated aero bottle and downtube storage box improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>Just like the Ordu, the new Orca Aero also gets Orbea’s aero <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottle</a> and cage, and integrated aero storage box under the downtube.</p>\n<p>Orbea says the bike is more slippery with both of these in place, though notes only the aero bottle and cage are approved for use in UCI sanctioned events (the storage box acts as a non-essential fairing, which means it falls foul of the UCI’s strict technical regulations).</p>\n<p>The new aero handlebar, stem and seatpost are also said to cut drag by two per cent versus the outgoing model.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The aero bottle and cage make the bike faster, but have to be used together. If you want to use standard, round bottles, you’ll need to swap in a standard bottle cage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<h3>Stiffness to weight</h3>\n<p>Keen to ensure the new Orca Aero climbs as efficiently as possible, Orbea says its goal with any road bike is “always to reduce the weight but keep the stiffness required for power transmission”.</p>\n<p>An unpainted, size 53cm frame is claimed to weigh 1,140g, plus 430g for the fork. This builds out to a 7.6kg complete bike with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-dura-ace-r9200/\">Shimano Dura-Ace R9200</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">SRAM Red eTap AXS</a> and deep-section carbon clincher wheels.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Orca Aero frameset is made from Orbea’s lightest, stiffest carbon fibre blend.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>Orbea says its OMX carbon fibre (Orbea’s term for its lightest, stiffest carbon fibre blend) and a size-specific lay-up procedure results in a bike that “shows no efficiency loss, even on the hardest climbs”.</p>\n<p>This claim is a result of real-world climb testing with Orbea’s sponsored professional team, Euskaltel–Euskadi. Riders were tasked with riding up hills at a target speed on different bike setups, and the power required to do so was recorded and taken as a marker for climbing efficiency (with less power equaling more efficient climbing).</p>\n<p>According to Orbea’s testing, a 400g weight increase leads to a penalty of only a few watts, even on steep, 10 per cent gradients.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea’s testing showed the relationship between adding weight to a bike, versus the extra power required to overcome that additional mass on various gradients.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>Though this may sound surprising (received wisdom is weight matters above all else on climbs), the tide may be turning in our understanding of what actually slows road cyclists down.</p>\n<p>Indeed, according to simulations by Swiss Side, a pure aero road bike with clincher or tubeless tyres may have been the fastest bike setup for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/aero-vs-lightweight-mont-ventoux/\">Stage 11 of the 2021 Tour de France</a>, which included two ascents of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ventoux-the-witches-cauldron-video/\">Mont Ventoux</a>.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/aero-bike-test-notes/\" target=\"_blank\">Five things I learned testing the latest aero road bikes</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Handling</h3>\n<p>Another key difference between a road bike and a time trial bike is how they handle out on the road.</p>\n<p>Time trial bikes are typically designed for high-speed, straight-line stability. Road racing bikes, on the other hand, need to feel nimble and versatile.</p>\n<p>Orbea says the Orca Aero’s updated geometry strikes “the perfect balance of responsiveness and stability”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A short wheelbase and short chainstays are intended to make the Orca Aero feel responsive under power.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>Firstly, the wheelbase has been shortened by a few millimetres (976.1mm on a size 53cm, down from 980mm on the old Orca Aero), and the chainstays are kept short at 408mm, across the size range. Orbea says both of these characteristics should help the new bike feel more responsive.</p>\n<p>Stack height has also been reduced by 5mm across the board, to promote a more aerodynamic riding position, and the bottom bracket drop has increased by 4mm to add more stability to the handling.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿2022 Orbea Orca Aero Geometry</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Frame size</td><td>47</td><td>49</td><td>51</td><td>53</td><td>55</td><td>57</td><td>60</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube length (mm)</td><td>459</td><td>474</td><td>499</td><td>524</td><td>544</td><td>564</td><td>589</td>        </tr><tr><td>Top tube length (effective, mm)</td><td>507.6</td><td>520.8</td><td>532.9</td><td>545.5</td><td>557.5</td><td>573.1</td><td>587</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube length (mm)</td><td>93.1</td><td>100.8</td><td>117.2</td><td>134.9</td><td>155.2</td><td>173.2</td><td>200.4</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstays (mm)</td><td>408</td><td>408</td><td>408</td><td>408</td><td>408</td><td>408</td><td>408</td>        </tr><tr><td>Bottom bracket height (mm)</td><td>260</td><td>260</td><td>260</td><td>262</td><td>262</td><td>262</td><td>262</td>        </tr><tr><td>Bottom bracket drop (mm)</td><td>76</td><td>76</td><td>76</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>74</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>9662</td><td>971</td><td>974.8</td><td>976.1</td><td>986.4</td><td>996.9</td><td>1010.8</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube angle (degrees)</td><td>71</td><td>71.5</td><td>72.2</td><td>72.8</td><td>730</td><td>73.2</td><td>73.2</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube angle (degrees)</td><td>74.5</td><td>74</td><td>73.7</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.2</td><td>73</td>        </tr><tr><td>Standover height (mm)</td><td>717</td><td>728.5</td><td>750.1</td><td>775</td><td>794</td><td>811.6</td><td>835.8</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (mm)</td><td>370</td><td>376</td><td>380</td><td>385</td><td>391</td><td>398</td><td>404</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack (mm)</td><td>496</td><td>505</td><td>523</td><td>542</td><td>562</td><td>580</td><td>606</td>        </tr><tr><td>Fork length (mm)</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td><td>370</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h3>Ergonomics</h3>\n<p>Orbea has steered away from a fully integrated cockpit on the new Orca Aero, saying it means “massive ergonomic gains for very little compromise”.</p>\n<p>While fully integrated front ends work great in wind tunnels, the lack of adjustability they typically have is often detrimental to ergonomics and aerodynamics once a rider is involved.</p>\n<p>This is because optimising a rider’s bike-fit and riding position is crucial for maximising comfort and aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/OrcaAero_Ergonomics_Stem-fc361b8.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The new alloy stem has a -10 degree rise and is available from 70-130mm in length.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Orbea</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/OrcaAero_Ergonomics_HB-0a34c17.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The OC3 Aero road handlebar comes in four sizes, from 36cm to 42cm.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Orbea</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/OrcaAero_Ergonomics_SP-790de64.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The updated aero seatpost features 25mm of setback adjustment and +/- 10 degrees of saddle tilt adjustment.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Orbea</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nOrbea’s new 6061 alloy stem has a -10 degree rise and comes in seven lengths, from 70mm to 130mm.

It features 80mm of reach and 125mm drops which flare out by 5 degrees. The handlebar can also be rotated up or down by 15 degrees, for further positional refinement.</p>\n<p>Out back, the updated aero seatpost is said to further reduce aerodynamic drag, and offers 25mm of setback adjustment range and +/- 10 degrees of tilt.</p>\n<h2>Orbea Orca Aero builds and availability</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Orca Aero gets Shimano’s latest 12-speed groupsets, but there’s no firm dates for when these builds will be available.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>The Orca Aero will be available in six different builds, with Shimano or SRAM groupsets. There are seven different frame sizes, from 47 to 60.</p>\n<p>Each build is available with a choice of three stock paint jobs, but builds and paint jobs can be customised via Orbea’s MyO programme. This allows customers to swap component sizes for free (a different stem length or handlebar width, for example), and make component upgrades (better wheels, tyres or a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meter</a> crankset) at additional cost.</p>\n<p>Orbea says some builds will be available at launch, depending on
