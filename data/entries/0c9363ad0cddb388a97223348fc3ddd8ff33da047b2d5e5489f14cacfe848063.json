This golden yellow is sure to pop with some bags and racks strapped to it. The Fargo is Salsa’s tried and true touring bike with a supple steel frame, a cargo fork (with all sorts of mounts), an upright riding position, lots of standover, 29+ tire clearance (on size small-xlarge), belt drive compatibility, and a 1x drivetrain. All in a new golden color for $2,599.
