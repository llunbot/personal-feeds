And if you’ve been drooling over it, now’s the time to buy: You can get it for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHRFYMM\">$732.89 at Amazon</a>, down from its $799 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 49mm black titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2 was only introduced a few weeks ago, but it’s definitely a model that we love because it looks stunning, no matter what color band you get. When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2203062/apple-watch-ultra-2-review-2.html\">reviewed the natural titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, we gave it a 4-star rating and appreciated the bright screen and the operating system that goes with it. The rugged watch is great for tracking sports and workouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Apple has broadened the variety of sports, and it’s possible to customize each one with the particular goals you want to achieve. And you can start a workout quickly by pressing the Action button if you’ve set it to do that. It all works brilliantly, especially for running, walking and cycling. The only criticism, really, is that not every kind of workout records your route using the built-in GPS,” our review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there’s more to this smartwatch. When you’re hiking, the Compass app helps you navigate any terrain. When you’re running, you get detailed metrics. If you want to work out, the watch can guide you through warmups, recovery intervals, and cool-downs. It’s also got incredible battery life that can stretch to 36 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take advantage of this deal and get yourself the most stylish version of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHRFYMM\">Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $732.89 at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Snatch the black titanium Ultra 2 on sale</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHRFYMM\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1f16befebc5ce6c6c2fd67d84be166fe419a7e67b1e1515e6332f2d329cc5363","category":"Apple"}
