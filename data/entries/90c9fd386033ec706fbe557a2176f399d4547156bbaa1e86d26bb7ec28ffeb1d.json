But there's a lot to suggest that user paul.gaastra, on the 68kMLA vintage Mac forum, has been right for more than a decade: One of the capacitors on the Apple mid-'90s Mac LC III was installed backward due to faulty silkscreen printing on the board.</p>\n<p>It seems unlikely that Apple will issue a factory recall for the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/112230\">LC III</a>—or the related LC III+, or Performa models 450, 460, 466, or 467 with the same board design. The \"pizza box\" models, sold from 1993–1996, came with <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/304879620202\">a standard 90-day warranty</a>, and most of them probably ran without issue. It's when people try to fix up these boards and replace the capacitors, in what is generally a good practice (re-capping), that they run into trouble.</p>\n<img width=\"2560\" height=\"858\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Macintosh LC III, on a table, facing front.\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-640x215.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-1024x343.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-768x258.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-1536x515.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-2048x687.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-980x329.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mac_lcIII-1440x483.jpg 1440w\" />\n      The Macintosh LC III, forerunner to a bunch of computers with a single misaligned capacitor.\n        Credit:\n          Akbkuku / Wikimedia Commons\n      \n<p>Doug Brown took part <a href=\"https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/lciii-recap-apple-design-fault-47uf-reversed.27834/\">in the original 2013 forum discussion</a>, and has seen it <a href=\"https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/lciii-c22-polarity.2708/\">pop up elsewhere</a>.
