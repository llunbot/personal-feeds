As the newest member of our gravity range, it sits next to our popular Newton and targets dry and rocky conditions. Over the course of the Wrangler’s development, including multiple iterations, prototypes and an extensive field test program in a variety of conditions and trails around the world, we have truly come up with a tire that that helps enable a better ride. With so much grip and support on tap, the Wrangler gives you the confidence to keep it wide open at all times.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Bastien Donzé, Goodyear Bicycle Tires Product Director</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Goodyear Wrangler enduro mountain bike ebike eMTB tires, riding Spanish rocks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_rock-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Goodyear)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled.jpg\" alt=\"Goodyear Wrangler enduro mountain bike ebike eMTB tires, tread detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_MTR-left-and-MTF-right-angled-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Goodyear Wrangler MTR rear (left) &amp; MTR front (right)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new dual-compound mountain bike Goodyear Wranglers come in front MTF &amp; and rear MTR treads with softer rubber up front, and two constructions – Enduro and a new ElectricDrive casing.

But there are some key differences in the center lugs and their layout. Goodyear designed the front Wrangler MTF with enhanced grip and directional control for steering, featuring a 3-2-2 center block layout and angled leading edges to all of those central blocks. The rear-specific Wrangler MTR on the other hand optimizes rolling speed and acceleration/stopping forces with a 3-2 layout and more edges perpendicular to the direction of travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing.jpg\" alt=\"Goodyear Wrangler enduro mountain bike ebike eMTB tires, e-bike-specific construction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_ebike-casing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As to tire construction, the Wrangler features an all-new ElectricDrive casing optimized for ebikes. The new casing mixes powerful grip with a durable structure to protect and maintain pedal-assist range. The construction is actually different for front and rear tires, with extra sidewall structure out back to address the heavier rearward weight balance on full-power eMTBs and the fact that ebike riders spend more time seated on the saddle than most pedaling mountain bikers. Both tires extend a tough butyl layer high up the tires sidewalls for extra pinch flat &amp; cut protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1279g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-rear.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1279g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-rear-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Goodyear Wrangler enduro mountain bike tires, 1279g actual weight 29x2.4&quot; rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1279g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-rear-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1279g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-rear-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1279g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-rear-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1279g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-rear-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1279g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-rear.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1115g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-front.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1115g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-front-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Goodyear Wrangler enduro mountain bike tires, 1115g actual weight 29x2.4&quot; front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1115g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-front-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1115g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-front-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1115g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-front-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1115g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-front-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-tire_1115g-actual-weight-29x2-4-enduro-MTR-front.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Goodyear Wrangler – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options.jpg\" alt=\"Goodyear Wrangler enduro mountain bike ebike eMTB tires, rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Goodyear-Wrangler-enduro-mountain-bike-ebike-eMTB-tires_studio-angled-options-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Goodyear Wrangler bike tires are available now for enduro bikes and eMTBs.
