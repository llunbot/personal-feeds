{"title":"Ryan Seacrest Tried Making an iPhone Hardware Keyboard Case 10 Years Ago","link":"https://www.engadget.com/2013-12-06-typo-keyboard.html?guccounter=1","date":1704419341000,"content":"\n<p>If the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/04/clicks\">aforelinked</a> new Clicks keyboard case for iPhones rings a bell, here’s Jon Fingas reporting for Engadget 10 years ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The market for keyboard-equipped phones may be on the wane, but \ndon’t tell that to Ryan Seacrest — the American Idol host is \nconvinced that messaging mavens need real buttons. To that end, \nhe’s jumping into hardware and launching the Typo Keyboard for the \niPhone 5 and 5S. The Bluetooth case turns an Apple handset into a \nmakeshift BlackBerry Q10, complete with backlit, sculpted keys \nthat cover up the iPhone’s home button (there’s a small substitute \nkey); we hope you don’t need multitasking, folks. The Typo \nKeyboard will make its formal debut at CES in early January, and \nit should ship that month for $99. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Typo keyboard was doomed in more ways than one: it used unreliable battery-draining Bluetooth, not a wired connection; iOS didn’t have good hardware keyboard support at the time; and, as Fingas alludes in his description above, the Typo keyboard’s design covered the iPhone’s home button. That was pretty much a dealbreaker for the iPhone 5S, which introduced Touch ID.</p>\n\n<p>Even worse, the shell of the company that was once the mighty BlackBerry <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/1/8696991/blackberry-typo-keyboard-lawsuit-settlement\">sued Typo for patent infringement</a>, won, and eventually <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/mobile/seacrest-out-blackberry-kills-his-typo-iphone-keyboard-n367736\">drove Typo out of business</a>.
