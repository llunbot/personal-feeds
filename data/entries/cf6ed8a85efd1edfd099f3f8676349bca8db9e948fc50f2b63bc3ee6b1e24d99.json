It adds to Google’s efforts stretching back more \nthan a decade to develop new computing resources, beginning with \nspecialized chips used for AI work. Google has leaned into that \nstrategy since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT kicked off an arms \nrace that has threatened its dominant position as a gateway to the \ninternet. </p>\n\n<p>The chip efforts promise to reduce Google’s reliance on outside \nvendors and bring it into competition with longtime partners such \nas Intel and Nvidia, analysts said. Google officials said they \ndidn’t view it as a competition. “I see this as a basis for \ngrowing the size of the pie,” said Amin Vahdat, the Google vice \npresident overseeing the company’s in-house chip operations. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Kay\">Alan Kay’s adage</a> remains evergreen: “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/09/google-ai-chips\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cf6ed8a85efd1edfd099f3f8676349bca8db9e948fc50f2b63bc3ee6b1e24d99","category":"Tech"}
