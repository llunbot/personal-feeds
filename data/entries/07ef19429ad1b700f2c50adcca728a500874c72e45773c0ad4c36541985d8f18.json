{"title":"Fairphone 4: A ‘Sustainable, Repairable, and Ethical’ Android Phone","link":"https://www.androidcentral.com/fairphone-4-review","date":1637618715000,"content":"\n<p>Jerry Hildenbrand, writing for Android Central:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The phone comes with a <a href=\"https://www.fairphone.com/en/warranty/\">full five-year warranty</a> that covers\nanything that you didn’t cause. For those things that you <em>did</em>\ncause, let’s say you dropped it and broke the display, you can\nlikely easily fix it yourself using inexpensive spare parts that\nFairphone sells itself.</p>\n\n<p>The same way Fairphone is attempting to shake up the phone\nindustry, it’s also trying to change the way we think about having\nour phones repaired. What keeps your Samsung phone from being easy\nto fix is how it is built and the materials used to make it.\nThings like glued-in displays or sealed cases aren’t an issue with\nthe Fairphone 4. You can pull out most internal assemblies and\nthen replace them with new components using only a small Philips\nhead screwdriver.</p>\n\n<p>Another side effect of this is having a battery that can be\nswapped at any time by removing the 100% recycled plastic\nbackplate. This used to be normal for Android phones, but I can’t\nthink of a single mainstream device with a user-swappable battery\nin 2021. Of course, you can still charge the battery quickly using\na USB C P.D. charger, but knowing that you can carry a spare “just\nin case” is great.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds great, right? But, among other caveats (e.g. a somewhat crummy camera given the €579/~$650 price):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One last issue is that the Fairphone 4 is “only” <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean\">IP54\nrated</a>. This means the Fairphone 4 is “protected against dust\ningress sufficient to prevent the product from operating normally,\nbut it’s not dust-tight. The product is fully protected against\nsolid objects and splashing of water from any angle”.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the Fairphone 4 in the rain, but you can’t take it\ninto the pool. Once you realize that the back of the phone pops\nright off and the fact that gaskets and other waterproofing\nmeasures would add to the cost considerably, you understand why.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>iPhones have been dust and waterproof <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/SP743?locale=en_US\">since the iPhone 7 in 2016</a>. (The iPhone 7 was rated IP68 — the 6 <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings\">means</a> dust-tight (the highest IP rating for particles), and the 8 means waterproof for full immersion (Apple says up to 6 meters depth for 30 minutes). <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-s21-5g/specs/\">Samsung’s S21 is rated IP68</a> (but only to a depth of 1.5 meters for 30 minutes), and Google’s <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pro\">Pixel 6 phones are rated IP68</a> as well, albeit with a disclaimer that reads, in part, “Water resistance isn’t a permanent condition, and diminishes or is lost over time due to normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage”).</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible that Fairphone — or someone else manufacturing a phone with Fairphone’s ease-of-repairability ideals — will eventually achieve IP68 levels of ingress protection? Of course. It’s also certainly the case that <em>some</em> people, like Hildenbrand, value repairability and battery-swapping more than they value dust and water resistance.</p>\n\n<p>But not most people.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/22/fairphone-4\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"07ef19429ad1b700f2c50adcca728a500874c72e45773c0ad4c36541985d8f18","category":"Tech"}
