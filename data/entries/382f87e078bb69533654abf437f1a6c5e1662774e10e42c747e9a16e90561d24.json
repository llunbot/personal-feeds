During an NBA game, a banner on the iPhone's Lock Screen shows the live score, quarter, time remaining, and other relevant information. The score is also shown in the Dynamic Island on iPhone 14 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's TV app already offered Live Activities support for NBA games, and now the functionality is available via the NBA app. The official MLB app was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/mlb-app-live-activities/\">also updated with Live Activities support</a> earlier this month, and it was announced last week that the <a href=\"https://wbd.com/ncaa-march-madness-live-tri-presented-by-att-capital-one-and-coca-cola-debuts-expanded-multi-game-viewing-options-dynamic-automotive-integrations-and-enhanced-bracket-experience-f/\">NCAA March Madness app would be adding support</a> for the feature as well.
