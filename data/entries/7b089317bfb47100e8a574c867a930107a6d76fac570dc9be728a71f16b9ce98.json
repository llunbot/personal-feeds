Kathy Hochul's office. That leaves the fate of about 72,000 workers in question as the deadline passes. In addition, only 81 percent of staff in the state's adult care facilities and 77 percent of all staff at nursing home facilities were fully vaccinated as of last week.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798836#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798836&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7b089317bfb47100e8a574c867a930107a6d76fac570dc9be728a71f16b9ce98","category":"Tech"}
