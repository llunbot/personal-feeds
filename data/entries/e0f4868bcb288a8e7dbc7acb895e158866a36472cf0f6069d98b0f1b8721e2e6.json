Over the last several weeks, three engineers have departed the company.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-yellow.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple's chief engineer for radar systems, Eric Rogers, left for <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com\">Joby Aviation</a>, a company working on electric aerial ridesharing. Alex Clarabut, an engineering manager for the battery team, and Stephen Spiteri, a hardware engineering manager, both joined <a href=\"https://www.archer.com\">Archer Aviation</a>, a company that is developing an air taxi.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a> engineering director Michael Schwekutsch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/01/apple-car-hardware-engineer-departs-company/\">left Apple</a> for Archer Aviation as well, and back in September, ‌Apple Car‌ project lead Doug Field <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-car-doug-field-joins-ford/\">left Apple for Ford</a> after three years of heading up ‌Apple Car‌ development.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple has lost six members of the project's management team in 2021 alone, but it has also brought on important new hires like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/apple-hires-former-bmw-exec-car-project/\">Ulrich Kranz</a>, former CEO of self-driving startup Canoo, and CJ Moore, who worked at Tesla and has expertise in self-driving software.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's work on an autonomous vehicle has been plagued by managerial shifts, changes in focus, and hiring issues almost since it began. With Field's departure, Apple brought on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/16/kevin-lynch-working-on-apple-car-development/\">Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch</a> to work on the ‌Apple Car‌, and he is working alongside AI chief John Giannandrea.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUnder Lynch's leadership, the ‌Apple Car‌ project is moving forward with the ambitious aim of producing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-car-fully-autonomous-2025-launch/\">autonomous electric vehicle</a> that does not require human intervention, which no other car manufacturer has been able to achieve.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is hoping to release a self-driving car by 2025, but the timeline may ultimately prove to be too aggressive.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-car-project-loses-3-engineers/\">Apple Car Project Loses Three Key Engineers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-project-loses-three-key-engineers.2326756/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lbjEmaG6Tz0:5t9JXtoI7ZQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lbjEmaG6Tz0:5t9JXtoI7ZQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e0f4868bcb288a8e7dbc7acb895e158866a36472cf0f6069d98b0f1b8721e2e6","category":"Apple"}
