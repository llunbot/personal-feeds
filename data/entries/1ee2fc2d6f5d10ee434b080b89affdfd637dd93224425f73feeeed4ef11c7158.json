However, it appears to also introduce a new one: Some users are running into problems getting CarPlay to connect after applying the update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over a billion iPhones in use, you can expect at least some reported problems after <em>any</em> update, but the CarPlay issue with 16.4.1 seems to be affecting an unusually high number of users.

It would appear that most users in the community with this problem have resolved them with at least one of these methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Make sure you’re using a genuine “Made for iPhone” <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668656/best-lightning-cables-for-iphone.html\">Lightning cable</a>. You’d be surprised how often substandard cables cause odd CarPlay issues even of they were working before.</li><li>Make sure CarPlay isn’t restricted. Go to Settings &gt; <em>Screen Time</em> &gt; <em>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</em>. If Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions is on, tap <em>Allowed Apps</em>, and make sure that <em>CarPlay</em> is enabled.</li><li>Check your car’s infotainment system menus for CarPlay, and see that your iPhone is listed <em>and enabled</em>. At least one user has reported the “always enabled” setting changing to “never enabled.” Every car has different menus and descriptions for this.</li><li>Remove CarPlay from your iPhone <em>and vehicle</em> and set it up from scratch. Go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>CarPlay</em> and you’ll see a list of available cars. Remove yours.
