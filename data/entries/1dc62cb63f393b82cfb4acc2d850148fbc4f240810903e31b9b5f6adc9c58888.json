And that’s what FFWD focused on for their new hollow full-carbon Falcon Disc rear wheel. Sure, they dialed weight down as low as 1040g and gave it an aero multi-curve lenticular shape for optimized aerodynamics. But, FFWD also made the Falcon Disc wider at 21mm internal, hooked tubeless for compatibility with most tire options, and even made both disc brake and rim brake versions so all racers could go faster against the clock…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FFWD Falcon Disc TT &amp; Tri lightweight carbon disc wheel</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD Falcon Disc TT &amp; Tri lightweight carbon disc wheel, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_angled-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/FFWD)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast, Light, Wide, Hooked Tubeless, Ratchet Internals, Disc &amp; Rim Brake Options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key talking points are that this is a versatile modern disc wheel for most time trial and triathlon racers out there. It isn’t the cheapest disc wheel out there, but when you factor in price, weight &amp; tech details, this looks to be one of the best combinations you will find. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What makes it unique?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_disc-side-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_disc-side-detail.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD Falcon Disc TT &amp; Tri lightweight carbon disc wheel, disc brake side dtail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_disc-side-detail.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_disc-side-detail-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_disc-side-detail-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_disc-side-detail-768x480.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new full carbon clincher hollow FFWD Falcon Disc wheel uses a new construction for the complex lenticular shape vs. the old foam core. You can get a sense of the shape from this cross-section drawing, where the mostly convex lenticular shape goes concave just below the tire (especially on the disc side) to smooth airflow over the outer edge of the wheel as it meets the tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_cross-section.jpg\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_cross-section.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD Falcon Disc TT &amp; Tri lightweight carbon disc wheel, cross-section\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_cross-section.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_cross-section-297x88.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_cross-section-120x36.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_cross-section-768x228.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the Falcon Disc features a hollow core, with the two carbon rim walls sandwiching a thinner polymethacrylimide inner structure for additional stiffness. FFWD saved 300g over their previous TT disc wheel. The rim brake wheel does add 85g back though to reinforce the braking surface and manage heat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD Falcon Disc TT &amp; Tri lightweight carbon disc wheel, freehub side detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_freewheel-side-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rim internal width</em>: 21mm hooked tubeless </li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>External width</em>: widest 28mm just below the tire</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Tire compatibility</em>: 23-30mm tubeless or tube-type (<em>minimum 25mm recommended</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Brake interface</em>: Centerlock disc or rim brake</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Wheel weight</em>: 1040g disc brake, 1125g rim brake (<em>claimed</em> <em>+/-40g</em>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Freehub</em>: FFWD Ratchet 36T 10° engagement</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Max tire pressure</em>: 8.38bar/120psi</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Max rider weight</em>: 120kg/265lb</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>FFWD Falcon Disc – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_left-and-right-sides.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_left-and-right-sides.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD Falcon Disc TT &amp; Tri lightweight carbon disc wheel, left &amp; right\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_left-and-right-sides.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_left-and-right-sides-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_left-and-right-sides-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_left-and-right-sides-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-Falcon-Disc-TT-Triathlon-lightweight-carbon-disc-wheel_left-and-right-sides-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hollow full carbon FFWD Falcon Disc TT &amp; Tri sells for 2200€ and is available now. Pick from rim brakes with a QR axle, or disc brakes with a 12mm thru-axle. Either option gives you the choice of a Shimano, SRAM, or Campagnolo freehub. And each wheel comes with a protective padded wheelbag, alloy tubeless valve &amp; 90° valve adapter, valve hole covers, with tubeless tape installed, and carbon-specific pads for the rim brake wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-triathlete-Kenneth-Vandendriessche-racing-new-Falcon-Disc-to-IronMan-Lanzarote-triathlon-win.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-triathlete-Kenneth-Vandendriessche-racing-new-Falcon-Disc-to-IronMan-Lanzarote-triathlon-win.jpg\" alt=\"FFWD Falcon Disc TT Tri wheel, triathlete Kenneth Vandendriessche 2024 IronMan Lanzarote triathlon win\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-triathlete-Kenneth-Vandendriessche-racing-new-Falcon-Disc-to-IronMan-Lanzarote-triathlon-win.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-triathlete-Kenneth-Vandendriessche-racing-new-Falcon-Disc-to-IronMan-Lanzarote-triathlon-win-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-triathlete-Kenneth-Vandendriessche-racing-new-Falcon-Disc-to-IronMan-Lanzarote-triathlon-win-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FFWD-triathlete-Kenneth-Vandendriessche-racing-new-Falcon-Disc-to-IronMan-Lanzarote-triathlon-win-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FFWD triathlete Kenneth Vandendriessche already rode the new Falcon Disc to an IronMan Lanzarote victory (and course record) last May.
