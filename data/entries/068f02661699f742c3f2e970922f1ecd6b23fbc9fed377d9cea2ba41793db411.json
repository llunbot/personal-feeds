It can also be used within select apps when ID is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the Iowa Department of Transportation, businesses are able to accept an ID in Apple Wallet using iOS apps like Tap2iD mobile, VeriScan, and Mobile ID Verify for in-person age verification purposes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with other states that have adopted digital ID integration in Apple Wallet, Iowa's DoT warns that the digital version does not replace a physical license or identification card. Locations that accept mobile IDs will expand over time, however.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced a new Wallet app that supported digital IDs back in 2022, but states have been slow to adopt the feature. So far, only Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Hawaii, California, and Ohio have implemented support. Apple has said that Connecticut, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Utah, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia are working on support.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/iowa-wallet-iphone-drivers-license-support/\">iPhone Driver's License Support Expands to Iowa</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-drivers-license-support-expands-to-iowa.2440782/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"068f02661699f742c3f2e970922f1ecd6b23fbc9fed377d9cea2ba41793db411","category":"Apple"}
