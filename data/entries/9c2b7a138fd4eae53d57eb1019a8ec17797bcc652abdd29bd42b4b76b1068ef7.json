All you have to do is pick your distance – short, standard, or long – then hop on one of the hourly group rides each day during its Stage. Then, you’ll earn some ‘unlocks’ along the ride – like special TdZ socks midway through Stage 2, a beanie after Stage 4, and the full event ride kit once you complete all 6 Stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stage 1: Rolling Start, Jan 6-12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 2: Rolling Heights Jan 13-19</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 3: Cruise Control, Jan 20-26</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 4: Summit Seeker, Jan 27 – Feb 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 5: Loop the Loop, Feb 3-9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 6: Endurance Quest, Feb 10-16</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Just 6 rides, reasonable distances, and not too much elevation.
