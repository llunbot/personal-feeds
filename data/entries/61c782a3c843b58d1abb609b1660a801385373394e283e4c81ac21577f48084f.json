The cranes then rotated the structure vertically, allowing workers to disconnect one of the cranes from the bottom of the rocket.</p>\n<p>That left the rocket hanging on a 325-ton overhead crane, which would lift it over the transom into the building's northeast high bay. The Boeing-built core stage weighs about 94 tons (85 metric tons), measures about 212 feet (65 meters) tall, and will contain 730,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant at liftoff. It is the single largest element for NASA's Artemis II mission, which is slated to ferry a crew of astronauts around the far side of the Moon as soon as next year.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/as-preps-continue-its-looking-more-likely-nasa-will-fly-the-artemis-ii-mission/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/as-preps-continue-its-looking-more-likely-nasa-will-fly-the-artemis-ii-mission/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61c782a3c843b58d1abb609b1660a801385373394e283e4c81ac21577f48084f","category":"Tech"}
