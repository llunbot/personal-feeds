This new algorithm reportedly improves blood oxygen sensing accuracy by 30% over the Oura Ring 3, and reduces gaps in heart rate tracking. The ring's sensors are also now recessed, which is said to provide a more comfortable fit for all-day wear. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new wearable boasts a slimmer profile and expanded size options to cater to a wider range of users. There are now twelve sizes, ranging from 4 to 15. (Oura Ring 3 was limited to sizes 6 to 13.) The expanded size range comes as Oura reports a shift in its user demographics, with women in their 20s now representing its fastest-growing segment. The company says battery life has also been extended to up to eight days, depending on the size of the ring. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlongside the hardware update, Oura has also overhauled its companion app with a new three-tab interface: Today, Vitals, and My Health. The redesign aims to simplify navigation and provide clearer insights into both daily and long-term health metrics. New features include automatic activity detection for over 40 activities, enhanced stress tracking, and a \"Fertile Window\" prediction tool for users trying to conceive. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPriced at $349, the Oura Ring 4 will be available in six colors: Gold, Rose Gold, Brushed Silver, Stealth, Black, and Silver. Shipping starts from October 15, but it's worth noting that Oura Ring 4 continues to be available via the company's controversial subscription model, with membership priced at $5.99 per month or $69.99 annually after the included one-month trial.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Ring Rumors</h2>\r<br />\nEarlier this year when the first reports of Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=26439\">Galaxy Ring</a> began to circulate, rumors about Apple's potential entry into the wearable ring market also <a href=\"https://www.etnews.com/20240220000215\">started swirling</a>.

However, Gurman at the time also said that active development was not underway, so it currently remains unclear if it will be released in the near-term, if indeed ever.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ring/\">Apple Ring</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/oura-ring-4-slimmer-sensors-improved-accuracy/\">New Oura Ring 4 Features Slimmer Sensors and Improved Accuracy</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-oura-ring-4-features-slimmer-sensors-and-improved-accuracy.2438990/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"305ba7428e81c42ba4421c18ec582fda73533cd8ca58e3c9e6c0dfc63e2e44bd","category":"Apple"}
