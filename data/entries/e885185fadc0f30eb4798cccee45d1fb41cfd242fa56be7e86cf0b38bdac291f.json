{"title":"More, Smaller Apps","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic/","date":1632251206000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom, back on August 30:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Primephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be\ntaken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a\ndedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s\nclassical user interface that fans have grown to love with more\nadded features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers\nwill receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access\nto hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and\nhigh-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in\nApple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve had this flagged for a few weeks. What I find interesting is Apple is going to use this acquisition to launch a dedicated classical music app, not to expand the Music app. iTunes, infamously, expanded greatly over the years, and everyone seems to agree that the user experience suffered for it. I wonder if that’s in the back of Apple’s mind here.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/21/more-smaller-apps\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e885185fadc0f30eb4798cccee45d1fb41cfd242fa56be7e86cf0b38bdac291f","category":"Tech"}
