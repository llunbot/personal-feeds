We’ve heard there’s a big redesign in store this year, the most dramatic change in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does that leave for May? Not much. There probably won’t be any big hardware or software releases or announcements this month—anything Apple has to reveal, it will do so at WWDC. That leaves software and services as the lone Apple releases for May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Apple surprised us with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324955/apple-let-loose-ipad-event-last-minute-rumors-how-to-watch.html\">rare May event</a> to announce the M4 iPad Pro, 13-inch iPad Air, and Apple Pencil Pro. It seems very unlikely that Apple will repeat that this month. While there are several products that <em>could</em> release ahead of WWDC, including the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2523902/a-new-airtag-is-coming-next-year-with-enhanced-privacy-security-features.html\">AirTag 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2585786/homepod-mini-2-upgrades-chatgpt-spatial-audio-android.html\">HomePod mini 2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">M4 Ultra Mac Pro</a>, rumors suggest they will arrive in the fall rather than the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2656294/ios-18-5-features-release-date-how-to-install.html\">iOS 18.5</a> and macOS 15.5, but those are relatively minor updates that focus on bug fixes and security, with only a couple of very minor changes. As always, however, there will be security and bug fixes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on previous yearly x.5 releases and how far along the betas are, we expect the wide release of iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, macOS 15.5, etc. around the second week of May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in May.
