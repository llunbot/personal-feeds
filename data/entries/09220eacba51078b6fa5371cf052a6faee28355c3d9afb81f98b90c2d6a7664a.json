Less well-known but equally significant from a nuclear arms race standpoint was the Soviet Union's successful detonation of hydrogen \"superbomb\" in the wee hours of October 30, 1961.</p>\n<p>Dubbed \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba\">Tsar Bomba</a>\" (loosely translated, \"Emperor of Bombs\"), it was the size of a small school bus—it wouldn't even fit inside a bomber and had to be slung below the belly of the plane. The 60,000-pound (27 metric tons) test bomb's explosive yield was 50 million tons (50 megatons) of TNT, although the design had a maximum explosive yield of 100 million tons (100 megatons).</p>\n<p>The US had conducted the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb (codename: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Mike\">Ivy Mike</a>) in 1954 and had been pondering the development of even more powerful hydrogen superbombs. But the Soviets' successful test lent greater urgency to the matter. Ultimately, President John F. Kennedy opted for diplomacy, signing the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty\"> Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty</a> on October 7, 1963.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811168#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811168&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"09220eacba51078b6fa5371cf052a6faee28355c3d9afb81f98b90c2d6a7664a","category":"Tech"}
