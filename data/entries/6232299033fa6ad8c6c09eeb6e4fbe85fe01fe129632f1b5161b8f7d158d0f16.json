Daylight Saving Time in 2024 kicked in all the way back in mid-March, so it's hard to say whether the problem is related to the change this time around.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020772#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020772&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6232299033fa6ad8c6c09eeb6e4fbe85fe01fe129632f1b5161b8f7d158d0f16","category":"Tech"}
