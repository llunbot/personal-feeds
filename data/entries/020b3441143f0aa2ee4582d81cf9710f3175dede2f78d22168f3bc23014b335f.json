FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-rosenworcel-acts-preserve-first-amendment\">said</a> the action is important because \"the incoming President has called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke licenses for broadcast television stations because he disagrees with their content and coverage.\"</p>\n<p>\"Today, I have directed the FCC to take a stand on behalf of the First Amendment,\" she said. \"We draw a bright line at a moment when clarity about government interference with the free press is needed more than ever. The action we take makes clear two things. First, the FCC should not be the president's speech police.
