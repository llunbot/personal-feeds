{"title":"The Pinarello F7: Ready to ride","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-f7","date":1727880600000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-f7\">The Pinarello F7: Ready to ride</a></p>\n\n<p>Pinarello’s F-series bikes open the world of race-proven road riding to a far wider range of riders, offering a combination of real-world performance and value for money, not to mention the kind of Italian style and passion that normally commands a much higher pricetag. And, thanks to a limited-time offer, Pinarello is imbuing the razor-sharp, Ultegra Di2-equipped F7 with even more performance and practicality for your money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Italian heritage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The name Pinarello is synonymous with everything that’s good about Italian bike manufacturing: passion, style, panache, cutting-edge design, high-end tech and – of course – sporting success. Its founder, Giovanni Pinarello, might have won the maglia nera at the 1951 Giro d’Italia (the Italian Grand Tour’s equivalent of the Tour de France’s lanterne rouge signifying the last-placed rider overall) in his riding days, but the bikes bearing his name are known for their race-winning pedigree. Since the company’s first Grand Tour victory in 1975, Pinarello has won the Tour de France with carbon, steel, aluminium and magnesium-framed bikes. And you don’t win the biggest race on the calendar without knowing how to put together a bike that excels in every area.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-2-970x546.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-2-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-2-768x433.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-2-750x423.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-2-1140x642.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Peerless performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinarello F7, which sits at the top of the UK’s F-series lineup, is one such machine. Extensive wind-tunnel testing and the use of computational fluid dynamics in its design process help optimise its design. Lowering the bike’s centre of gravity allowed the F7’s designers to change the seatpost dimensions for improved aerodynamics, while dramatically dropped seatstays further minimise wind resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Climbing is a breeze thanks to a lightweight Toray T900 carbon fibre frame, while Pinarello’s unique asymmetrical chainstay/seatstay design counters the chain’s torsional forces to ensure maximum power goes into driving you forward. It adds up to an incredible spec for your money, which is sure to pay dividends out on the road.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-3-970x546.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-3-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-3-768x433.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-3-750x423.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-3-1140x642.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Do the maths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello has given the F7 similar performance-focussed geometry to its Dogma race bike, so you can add handling to its list of strengths. Relatively short chainstays combine with a short trail figure to offer agile, pin-sharp steering, while a long reach and short stack put you in a stretched out – yet stable – position on the saddle. The 30mm tyre clearance opens a world of options for high-volume, low-pressure performance tyres as well. Pinarello offers the F7 in nine frame sizes, so finding one that fits you should be no problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spec-fest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The F7 also benefits from the trickle-down of high-end components and finishing kit from Pinarello’s top-tier race bikes, not to mention extensive R&amp;D and its passionate engineers’ deep understanding of what makes a winning bike. Headline specs include a fully integrated MOST Talon Ultra Light one-piece bar/stem, MOST Ultrafast 40 carbon wheels, a full Shimano Ultegra Di2 groupset, that T900 carbon frameset as well as TiCR internal cable routing to ensure invisible wiring and hoses throughout.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"693\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-693x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-693x970.jpg 693w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-214x300.jpg 214w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-360x504.jpg 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-750x1050.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4-1140x1596.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pinarello-f7-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Unmissable offer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But it gets even better.
