Today you can choose from a range of sophisticated and versatile floor cleaners–but with so many clever features and powerful capabilities on the market, it’s even more crucial that you pick the right model for your needs. Here’s what you should be looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ability to wash and mop as well as vacuum. That way you can clean hard floors just as effectively as carpets, and tackle spillages with ease.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Effective cleaning capabilities! Otherwise, what’s the point?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Self-cleaning function, to save you a huge amount of hassle.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cordless design, so you’re not constantly trying to work around the available power points.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low weight for convenience of use.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability to last a long time between pauses for charging or emptying. Look for a model with excellent battery performance and large tank capacity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional features. Does the cleaner provide alerts when tanks need emptying? Does it have multiple modes? Does it have functions to preserve battery life?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Affordable price tag: Currently in the market, it’s really hard to find an all-round floor cleaner for less than $200.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If your chosen cleaner ticks all eight boxes, it’s the one for you.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Eureka NEW400 storage\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_5.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Eureka</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why the Eureka NEW400 is worth a look</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get more specific. On the eight criteria mentioned above, the Eureka NEW400 is a high-scoring, great-value floor cleaner you should seriously consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>It’s a versatile cleaner, with the ability to vacuum, mop and wash simultaneously. The mopping function is based on running water: clean water drains through multiple holes to soak the roller, while dirty water is removed to a separate tank. It avoids the re-use of dirty water, solving the issue of traditional steam mops that just seem to spread the dirt around.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This is a superb cleaner. On carpets, rugs, marble, ceramic and wood alike, the powerful suction is highly effective at removing debris, while the mop disposes quickly of stains and spillages. Pet and other odors are neutralized by sterilizing liquid. And because the mop function boasts an impressive 90%-plus water recovery rate, your floors will be dry in no time, and protected from the water stains you may get with lesser products.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Eureka has a user-friendly self-cleaning function. When this is activated, the rolling brush spins at high speed; it is sprayed with clean water, brushed, and scraped, with the dirty water safely removed to the appropriate tank. You never need to hand-wash the brush.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of course it’s cordless! Why would you want to be limited by inconvenient wires?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>At just 8.7lb, the Eureka is lightweight, portable and easy to use. It’s even effortless to push around thanks to a convenient self-propelling function, and convenient to store because of its small base.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You won’t need to change the water tanks very often because of their impressive capacities: 600ml of clean water and 400ml of dirty; both compare favorably to rival products. And battery performance is excellent: the 2500mAh cell can last for up to 30 minutes of intense cleaning. Best of all, even when there isn’t enough power remaining to do any more floor cleaning, the device will be able to perform a full self-clean. This is crucial to avoid unpleasant smells!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Yes, yes, and yes! When the dirty water tank is full, the Eureka gives you an alert, stopping automatically and flashing purple lights. There are multiple modes, and the cleaner intelligently stops operation whenever you stand it upright, saving on power and reducing unnecessary noise.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price? All of this can be yours for just $199. We don’t think you’ll find a better deal elsewhere.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Eureka NEW400 in action\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eureka-New400_15.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Eureka</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get the best deal on your new floor cleaner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can order the Eureka NEW400 today direct from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://s.whaee.com/vEeMr0d&amp;xcust=1-1-2138909-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> or find it through all good home appliance retailers.
