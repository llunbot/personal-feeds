The paywalled report notes that the discussions haven't been finalized and could fall through.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs part of Apple Intelligence, Apple has announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow Siri to access ChatGPT directly in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia to provide better responses in relevant situations. Using ChatGPT will be optional, so users with concerns about the technology can abstain and still make use of Apple's own new AI features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpeaking at WWDC 2024, Apple's senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi said that the company eventually wants to give its users a choice between different AI models. Federighi also suggested that Google Gemini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-add-more-ai-models-in-future/\">could be an option</a> in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple isn't paying OpenAI as part of the partnership, and <em>WSJ</em> reports that discussions with other AI companies have similarly taken place with the understanding that neither party will pay each other. Rather, pushing an AI model to hundreds of millions of Apple devices is considered to be of equal or greater value: AI companies get to sell premium subscriptions to their services through Apple Intelligence, while Apple is in a position to take a commission on sales. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, it's still not clear how much of a financial windfall such deals will be for AI companies in the long term, given that a surge of users from Apple devices will undoubtedly require more of the companies' own compute power and budget.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-talks-ai-model-ios-18/\">Apple and Meta Reportedly Discussed AI Partnership for iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-meta-reportedly-discussed-ai-partnership-for-ios-18.2429940/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b084658256e395291739b505891f270aa8690017c4467ac93189afc3b261127","category":"Apple"}
