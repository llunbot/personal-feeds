Those Macs were updated in October 2024. At the same time, Apple doubled the RAM in the MacBook Air M3 and M2, so we have updated our advice accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I upgrade from my Intel Mac? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are now more than four years into Apple’s transition from Intel processors to its own silicon that includes CPU, GPU, and unified memory. The transition began with the introduction of the M1 in November 2020. Since June 2023 every Mac Apple sells uses Apple’s own chips rather than Intel processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve yet to upgrade your Intel Mac to one powered by Apple’s silicon what are you waiting for? If you are concerned that a must-have app doesn’t run on an M-series Mac, consider finding a new app because the performance gains are tremendous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good reason to update your Intel Mac is that it is unlikely to be supported by Apple for much longer in terms of security updates. With the arrival of macOS Sequoia, the number of supported Intel Macs is fewer than ever, and although Apple will be supporting Sonoma for a couple more years, and Ventura for another year, only a few of the most recent Intel Macs still be supported in a year or so.

There are currently three versions of the MacBook Air available from Apple: a 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip, a 13-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip, and a 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip. The M2 MacBook Air had a price cut when the M3 model was introduced in March 2024: it now starts at $999/£999.</p>\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air was introduced in July 2022 with a brand-new look and a 13.6-inch screen (up from 13.3 inches). It’s a great machine, but the newer MacBook Air is only $100/$100 more than the M2 model and is well worth the upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Another update came in October 2024 when Apple doubled the RAM (unified memory) from 8GB to 16GB without changing the price. This is an excellent update meaning that the MacBook Air is better value than ever. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The MacBook Air is ideal for the budget-conscious. It’s also for anyone who is always on the go, doesn’t want to be bogged down by a regular-size laptop, and needs a computer that’s more versatile than an iPad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 13-inch MacBook Air (M2) cost? </strong>Prices start at $999/£999 M2 MacBook Air with 256GB SSD and 16GB RAM and $1,199/£1,199 for the MacBook Air M2 with 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM. Make sure to check how much RAM is in the model you are buying and that it is priced accordingly. To update the RAM to 16GB would previously have cost $200/£200. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The entry-level M2 MacBook Air has 8 GPU cores, just like the entry-level M3 model, but the M3 is a step up from the M2 thanks to the newer 3nm manufacturing process. The M3 also offers faster Wi-Fi than the M2. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M2, 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU,<em> 16GB</em> <em>memory</em>, 256GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports: $999/£999.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M2, 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU,<em> 16GB memory</em>, 512GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports: $1,199/£1,199.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: 24GB memory.

If you want to connect USB-A devices, you need either a USB-C to USB adapter, like Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\">$19</a> / <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ1M2ZM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">£19</a> one, or a USB-C hub that has USB-A ports. See our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668462/best-usb-c-hubs-and-adapters-for-mac.html\">best USB-C hubs and adapters</a>. If you want to plug in more than one external display officially you can’t – but we know a workaround, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">How to connect two or more external displays to an M-series MacBook</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air has built-in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) for connecting to a network (the M3 offers faster Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax). It also provides built-in Bluetooth 5.3 for wirelessly connecting a mouse or other peripherals. If you want to connect to an ethernet network, you need an adapter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> The M2 provides performance that is leaps and bounds faster than the Intel processors that were previously found in the MacBook Air, and Apple claims an 18 percent total CPU improvement over the M1 and a 35 percent improvement in graphics speed. It’s plenty fast enough for general-purpose use. But because it doesn’t have a fan to keep the computer cool, it may throttle down its speed during long processing sessions, such as video editing or compiling code, for which the MacBook Pro with its fan is a better choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The MacBook Air with M2 is a great affordable laptop for someone who does general-purpose work and moves around a lot, such as a student or a self-employed person. But it only costs another $100/£100 to upgrade to the M3 model, so unless you want to use that $100/£100 to upgrade the storage, we recommend the M3 over the M2. You may also want to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1483183/ssd-speeds-m2-macbook-pro-mac-mini.html\">avoid the entry-level models due to slower SSDs</a>, but that may not be an issue if the kind of work you do doesn’t require a lot of writing to the hard drive.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"5712\" height=\"4284\" alt=\"13-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_2709.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,099\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$844 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6602766/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$849 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860123-REG/apple_mc8g4ll_a_13_macbook_air_m3.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1651121/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$999 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Apple introduced the M3 version of the MacBook Air in March 2024, it then updated the Unified Memory (RAM) from 8GB to 16GB in October 2024 and didn’t change the price. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The M3 MacBook Air looks identical to the M2 version (above), but there are some changes to the specs that make this a much better machine–and it only costs $100/£100 more.

Unlike the M2 MacBook Air, the M3 MacBook Air is able to support more than one external display (although there is a  workaround for older Mac laptops, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">How to connect two or more external displays to an M1, M2 or M3 MacBook</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The MacBook Air has Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) for connecting to a network (faster than the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) in the M2 model.

Apple says the M3 is “60 percent faster” than the M1 MacBook Air and “up to 13x faster” than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air. So the MacBook Air should be more than fast enough for general-purpose use. The only issue is that, because it doesn’t have a fan to keep the computer cool, it may slow down during long processing sessions to keep cool. So if you are likely to be video editing or compiling code the MacBook Pro with its fan is a better choice. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The MacBook Air is a great choice for someone who does general-purpose work and moves around a lot, such as a student or a self-employed person. Note that it’s impossible to upgrade the storage or memory after purchase, so you should buy the model with the largest amount of storage and memory you can afford. The good news about the M3 MacBook Air is that it doesn’t appear to be saddled with slow storage in the same way that the M2 model is. We have previously recommended that buyers should <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1483183/ssd-speeds-m2-macbook-pro-mac-mini.html\">avoid the entry-level models due to slower SSDs</a>, but it appears that the storage in the 256GB M3 MacBook Air model is made up of two 128GB NAND chips, rather than one 256GB chip, so the two drives can process data simultaneously, so the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262059/ssd-brings-a-surprise-upgrade-over-the-m2speeds-faster-nand-chip.html\">storage in the 256GB M3 MacBook Air should work faster</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We compare the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667144/macbook-air-or-macbook-pro.html\">MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro</a> separately.

Compared to the 13-inch MacBook Air the 15-inch model offers a bigger screen (obviously) and a six-speaker system rather than four speakers. Surprisingly, battery life isn’t better on the 15-inch, despite the bigger battery. As with the other MacBook Air models, the MacBook Air now comes with 16GB RAM as standard. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The 15-inch MacBook Air is ideal for anyone who wants a big-screen laptop without having to spend a fortune. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models cost considerably more than the 15-inch MacBook Air does. It’s a great choice for anyone who is always on the go due to its lightweight design.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 15-inch MacBook Air (M3) cost? </strong>There are three configurations starting at $1,299/£1,399. The price hasn’t changed despite Apple increasing the RAM from 8GB to 16GB, which used to cost $200/£200 at the point of sale.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The specifications of the M3 MacBook Air are generally the same, although the entry-level 13-inch has an 8-core GPU option the 15-inch doesn’t have. You are essentially paying $200/£200 more for the bigger screen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M3, 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, <em>16GB memory</em>, 256GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports: $1,299/£1,299.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3, 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, <em>16GB memory</em>, 512GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports: $1,499/£1,499.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3, 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, <em>24GB memory</em>, 512GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports: $1,699/£1,699.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: Up to 2TB storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some differences between the 13- and 15-inch models in terms of audio, with the larger model featuring more speakers as well as a larger screen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are display specifications?</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display has a native resolution of 2,880×1,864 and 500 nits brightness.</li>\n\n<li>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has a native resolution of 2,560×1,664 and 500 nits brightness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> All MacBook Airs with M2 or M3 chips have a MagSafe port for charging as well as a pair of Thunderbolt/USB 4 connectors. The M3 MacBook Air offers Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) for connecting to a network (faster than the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) in the M2 models. It also provides built-in Bluetooth for wirelessly connecting a mouse or other peripherals. If you want to connect to an ethernet network, you need an adapter. Unlike the M2 MacBook Air, the M3 MacBook Air is able to support more than one external display (although there is a workaround for older Mac laptops, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">How to connect two or more external displays to an M1, M2 or M3 MacBook</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> This is the same M3 as found in the 13-inch MacBook Pro, so you can expect similar performance, however, the Air doesn’t have a fan to keep the computer cool, so it may throttle down its speed during long processing sessions, such as video editing or compiling code, for which a MacBook Pro would be a better option. In our tests, the M3 was better than the M1 Pro, and Apple says the M3 is “60 percent faster” than the M1 MacBook Air and “up to 13x faster” than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The 15-inch MacBook Air is a more affordable Mac laptop than the 14-inch MacBook Pro, so if you want your screen to be bigger than 13 inches, and you don’t need the power of a MacBook Pro for the kind of work you do, the 15-inch MacBook Air is a great option. Our recommendation is to up the amount of RAM (Unified Memory) when you buy it as you can’t update it later and we think 8GB isn’t really enough. If you can afford to you should also avoid the 256GB SSD model because that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1483183/ssd-speeds-m2-macbook-pro-mac-mini.html\">SSD is known to be slower</a>, but that may not be an issue if the kind of work you do doesn’t involve writing to the drive often. If you took that advice the MacBook Air (with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD) costs $1,699/£1,699, which, depending on where you live, is either $100 more, or the same price as the 14-inch MacBook Pro ($1,599/£1,699). That MacBook Pro comes with the same 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 512GB SSD, but only offers 8GB RAM, the 16GB Unified Memory update would add another $200/£200 to that price.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2743\" alt=\"Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4, 2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Macbook-Pro-14-M3.jpg?quality=50u0026strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,599 | $1,799 | $1,999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHWM5FB?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$1,399 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859560-REG/apple_mw2u3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1648584/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1399 at  B&amp;H</a><a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6602741/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$1399 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> In October 2024 Apple updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip. The M4 14-inch MacBook Pro arrived a year after the M3 version replaced the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is no longer sold. The 14-inch MacBook Pro was already much better than the old 13-inch MacBook Pro thanks to the HDR ProMotion display, more storage, HDMI and SDXC slots, better battery life, and a newer design. The 2024 update makes it better than ever with double the RAM (16GB rather than a paltry 8GB).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The 14-inch MacBook Pro is for a more demanding user than the MacBook Air. Its main benefit is the design allows for better cooling, which means that if you push the machine it won’t slow down to avoid overheating. However, there are other MacBook Pros available from Apple (including a 16-inch model) that offer faster processors, so if you really need a powerful machine one of those might be more suitable–we’ll discuss the M4 Pro and M4 Max models below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 14-inch MacBook Pro cost?</strong> The entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,599/£1,599. There’s another model available with twice the storage (1TB) for $200/£200 more. Great news if you are in the U.K. – the new models cost less than the predecessors did. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB memory, 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, SDXDC, HDMI, $1,599/£1,599.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB memory, 1TB SSD, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, SDXDC, HDMI, $1,799/£1,799.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 24GB memory, 1TB  SSD, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, SDXDC, HDMI, $1,999/£1,999.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: 32GB memory; up to 2TB storage</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are display specifications?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a native resolution of 3,024×1,964 and 1,000 nits brightness, 1600 nits peak, 600 nits SDR brightness, and ProMotion for adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz.</li>\n\n<li>The notch at the top of the display conceals the 12MP FaceTime camera which now features Centre Stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Apple now includes three Thunderbolt 4 ports (up from just two). These are compatible with USB-C (if you have wired devices that aren’t USB-C or are an older version of Thunderbolt, you’ll need an adapter, we have a separate <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229045/thunderbolt-3-adapter-m1-imac-macbook-pro-mac-mini-usb-displayport-hdmi-ethernet.html\">MacBook Pro Thunderbolt adapter guide</a> to help you decide which ones you’ll need). The 14-inch MacBook Pro also comes with an HDMI port for connecting an external display or projector, and an SDXC Card slot for plugging in memory cards from cameras, audio recorders, and other devices. The HDMI port also supports multichannel audio output.</p>\n\n<p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless connectivity. The 2024 models offer Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.3, as was the case with the predecessor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The M4 version of the 14-inch MacBook Pro is now a generation ahead of the MacBook Air. Even without the chip boost, you can expect more out of the MacBook Pro just because it features a fan for cooling (the MacBook Air doesn’t have the space for this). If you need a really powerful Mac then you should look to the M4 Pro or even the M4 Max.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro costs $1,599/£1,599, which is quite a bit higher than the $1,299/£1,349 price the 13-inch MacBook Pro sold for. And much more than the 13-inch MacBook Air (with the M3 model starting at $1,099/£1,099). That’s $500/£500 more than the entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air, and $600/£600 more than the M2 MacBook Air. That’s enough to buy a Mac mini and have money left over! </p>\n\n<p>The MacBook Pro is a chip generation ahead of the MacBook Air, but that is unlikely to be the case for long. So if budget is what is important to you, buy a MacBook Air.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2510333/14-inch-m4-macbook-pro-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro/M4 Max, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2560\" alt=\"14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro/M4 Max, 2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,999 | $2,399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHDJH98?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$1,749 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859567-REG/apple_mx2h3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1664720/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1749 at  B&amp;H</a><a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6602748/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$1799 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro or M4 Max was introduced in October 2024 (a year after the M3 Pro and M3 Max models). This is one of Apple’s top-of-the-line laptops, the other being the 16-inch MacBook Pro (discussed next). There’s not a huge difference between the specs on offer–both offer the M4 Max as a processor option–but the 14-inch MacBook Pro is cheaper than the 16-inch. If you want a laptop that can handle any task you throw at it—and you don’t have a constraining budget—you want one of these laptops. The new M4 Pro/Max models offer better battery life (22 hours) than the previous generation did (18 hours). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> When Apple called these “Pro” laptops, they weren’t kidding around. If your work is very demanding processing power, these laptops are happy to handle it. Work in pro-level software all the time? Get a 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro. With either the M4 Pro or M4 Max processor, they’re the fastest laptops Apple has ever created.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 14-inch MacBook Pro cost? </strong>There are three configurations starting at $1,999/£1,999 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 Pro with 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, and 512GB SSD, and $2,399/£2,399 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 Pro with 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU, 24GB unified memory and 1TB SSD. The third option is the M4 Max version with a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 36GB memory, and 1TB SSD, which costs $3,199/£3,199. All those prices are £100 lower in the U.K. than they were.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> Here are the standard configurations for the 14-inch MacBook Pro</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M4 Pro, 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB memory, 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, SDXC, HDMI, 70W Power Adapter, $1,999/£1,999.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4 Pro, 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB memory, 1TB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, SDXC, HDMI, 96W Power Adapter, $2,399/£2,399.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4 Max, 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 36GB memory, 1TB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, SDXC, HDMI, 96W Power Adapter, $3,199/£3,199.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: M4 Max, 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU; 36GB (now possible with Pro chip) 48GB, 96GB or 128GB unified memory; up to 8TB SSD (with Max).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are display specifications?</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display hasn’t changed from its native resolution of 3,024×1,964, 254 pixels per inch, 1,600 nits of maximum brightness and 1,000 nits for HDR content, but it now offers 1000 nits for standard content, up from 600. You’ll also get a 1,000,000-to-1 contrast ratio and ProMotion support with a refresh rate up to 120Hz.</li>\n\n<li>The notch at the top of the display conceals the 12MP Center Stage camera with support for Desk View and 1080p HD video recording. The notch does not affect the available screen area—the work area is a 16-by-10 space, while the screen surrounding the notch is considered extra space and is used to display the menu bar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> The 14-inch MacBook Pro has Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connectivity. </p>\n\n<p>As for its ports, Apple includes three Thunderbolt 5/USB C ports. If you have a Thunderbolt device, you can plug it directly into the laptop. The same goes for any USB-C device. </p>\n\n<p>These laptops also come with an HDMI port for connecting an external display or projector, and an SDXC Card slot for plugging in memory cards from cameras, audio recorders, and other devices. The HDMI port in the 2023 model supports multichannel audio output. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I charge the laptop?</strong> Battery life improved for this generation. Up from 18 hours to 22 hours for the M4 Pro (still 18 hours on the M4 Max). A fast charging feature allows the laptop to go from no charge to 50 percent in 30 minutes, but you need to have the proper power adapter to do this. It won’t work with the 70W adapter that comes with the $1,999 MacBook Pro. The 14-inch models need to use the 96W adapter (which is a $20/£10 upgrade) and can do fast charging through MagSafe or a Thunderbolt port.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> Apple built the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with pro users in mind and it shows in the performance. Now that Apple has introduced the M4 Pro and M4 Max you can enjoy the fastest Mac laptops Apple has ever made, although when it comes to graphics prowess the Max will always beat the Pro. So if you need the fastest then you’ll want to upgrade to the M4 Max.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The only reason not to buy the 14-inch M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro would be if you saw a good deal on the M3 Pro/M3 Max version–we’ve been seeing some <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">excellent deals and price cuts</a> on the older models, just remember that there was less RAM in those model (18GB rather than 24GB at the entry-level). Our other advice would be that if you are considering the 14-inch MacBook Pro because you need a powerful Mac then, ignore the $1,999/£1,999 model in favor of the $2,399/£2,399 model which has more CPU and GPU cores. If you don’t need 1TB storage, save money by adding the M4 Pro with 14-core CPU, and 20-core GPU as a build-to-order option to the $1,999/£1,999 model for an additional $200/£200, bringing the price to $2,199/£2,199.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro/M4 Max, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2743\" alt=\"16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro/M4 Max, 2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-left-angle.jpg?quality=50u0026strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$2,499 | $2,899\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHDCN6P?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$2,199 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6602751/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$2199 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859570-REG/apple_mx2t3ll_a_16_macbook_pro_m4.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1648591/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$2249 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The 16-inch MacBook Pro, like the 14-inch model above, was updated in October 2024. It offers a similar set of specs and configuration options as the 14-inch MacBook Pro (above), but it has a higher price, a bigger screen, and better battery life (24 hours, up from 22 hours on the predecessor).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> This is Apple’s largest “Pro” laptop and it’s designed for people who need a portable Mac to do work that demands extreme processing power. You could save some money by opting for the 14-inch MacBook Pro, but if you need a big screen on your laptop this is the Mac for you. You’ll also benefit from longer battery life. Configured with the M4 Max this is the fastest and most powerful laptop Apple has ever created.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 16-inch MacBook Pro cost? </strong>There are four standard configurations starting at $2,499/£2,499 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Pro with 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU and 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD; $2,899/£2,899 for the MacBook Pro M4 Pro with 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 48GB RAM, and 512GB SSD; $3,499/£3,499 for the MacBook Pro M4 Max with 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 36GB RAM, and 1TB SSD; and the M4 Max with 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB RAM and 1TB SSD for $3,999/£3,999. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> Here are the standard configurations for the 16-inch MacBook Pro introduced in 2024.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M4 Pro, 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB memory, 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, SDXC, HDMI, 140W power adapter, $2,499/£1,299.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4 Pro, 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 48GB memory, 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, SDXC, HDMI, 140W power adapter, $2,899/£2,899.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4 Max, 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 36GB memory, 1TB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, SDXC, HDMI, 140W power adapter, $3,499/£3,499.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4 Max, 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB memory, 1TB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, SDXC, HDMI, 140W power adapter, $3,999/£3,999.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: 48GB, 64GB, or 128GB unified memory.

If you have a Thunderbolt device, you can plug it directly into the laptop. The same goes for any USB-C device. However, if you have wired devices that aren’t USB-C or are an older version of Thunderbolt, you’ll need an adapter. We have a separate <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229045/thunderbolt-3-adapter-m1-imac-macbook-pro-mac-mini-usb-displayport-hdmi-ethernet.html\">MacBook Pro Thunderbolt adapter guide</a> to help you decide which ones you’ll need. Unfortunately, be prepared to shell out a good amount of extra cash.</p>\n\n<p>These laptops also come with an HDMI 2.0 port for connecting an external display or projector, and an SDXC Card slot for plugging in memory cards from cameras, audio recorders, and other devices. The HDMI port supports multichannel audio output. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I charge the laptop?</strong> Apple has equipped the 14-inch and 16-inch laptops with MagSafe, a magnetic connector that breaks away with a good tug. It’s a nice safety feature, but you can also charge using the Thunderbolt port, too. Battery life is improved for this generation: up from 22 hours to 24 hours. </p>\n\n<p>The fast charging feature allows the laptop to go from no charge to 50 percent in 30 minutes, but you need to have the proper power adapter to do this. Fast charging does not work through Thunderbolt or with an adapter with lower wattage, so you’ll need the 140W power adapter that is included in the box for this. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> The 16-inch MacBook Pro models were built with pro users in mind so you can expect excellent performance. Your software will be able to take full advantage of the CPU’s multiple cores. If you are a professional, you’ll benefit from the M4 Pro or M4 Max.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The M4 Pro and Max launched in October 2024, so don’t expect an update until late in 2025 or beyond. As above, look out for deals on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models, but note that there is more RAM in the newer models (24GB up from 18GB for the entry-level M4 Pro).  We often see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">excellent deals and price cuts</a> on these models which while not as powerful are still excellent machines.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2511696/16-inch-macbook-pro-m4-pro-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMac mini (M4/M4 Pro, 2024) \t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" alt=\"Mac mini (M4/M4 Pro, 2024) \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/m4-mac-mini-coffee.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$599 | $799 | $999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBTPDCS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$559 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859258-REG/apple_mu9d3ll_a_mac_mini_m4_10c_10cgpu_16gb_256gb.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1647307/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$559 at  B&amp;H</a><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Mac-mini-Apple-M4-chip-with-10C-CPU-10C-GPU-256GB-SSD-16GB-Memory-MU9D3LL-A-Fall-2024/13715211330\" target=\"_blank\">$574 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The Mac mini with M4 and a Mac mini with M4 Pro were introduced in October 2024. This was already Apple’s smallest desktop Mac, but now it is even smaller following a redesign that means it now measures 5 inches by 5 inches, down from 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches. It offers a nice combination of speed and, at just $599/£599, affordability (in fact the 2024 is even cheaper in the U.K. where it costs £50 less than it did). It’s not only fast enough for general-purpose use, but its multi-core speed is quite good—if you use a professional app like a video editor, 3D software, or developer tools, the Mac mini can handle it, no problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> Because of its price and performance, the Mac mini is a great Mac for just about anybody. It makes for an ideal primary Mac for a home or small office. Professionals on a budget will be satisfied with the Mac mini. If you’re switching from a PC, you can use your PC’s keyboard and mouse with the Mac mini. The Mac mini is also ideal as a secondary Mac in your home, and it can integrate into your home entertainment center.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the Mac mini cost?</strong> There are three standard configurations starting at $599/£599 for the Mac mini M4 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB unified memory, and 256GB SSD. There’s also a $799/£799 Mac mini M4 with 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB unified memory and 512GB SSD, and a $999/£999 Mac mini M4 with 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 24GB unified memory and 512GB SSD. At the top of the range is an M4 Pro Mac mini with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, and 512GB SSD which costs $1,399/£1,399. The price is about $1,000/£1,000 less for a similarly specced MacBook Pro, although, in each case, the MacBook has a bigger SSD.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> Apple sells three <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini\">Mac mini models</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB memory, 256GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2 USB-C, HDMI, $599/£599.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB memory, 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2 USB-C, HDMI, $799/£799.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 24GB memory, 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2 USB-C, HDMI, $999/£999.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4 Pro, 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB memory, 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 ports, 2 USB-C, HDMI, $1,399/£1,399.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: M4 Pro with 14-core CPU, 16-core GPU; 48GB or 64GB unified memory; up to 8TB SSD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mac mini does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse, so you’ll have to provide your own, or you can customize your order to include these devices as extra-cost options.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> Like Apple’s other Macs, the Mac mini has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The $599 and $799 M4-based Mac minis have three Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports, while the M4 Pro-based Mac mini has three Thunderbolt 5 ports. All Mac minis also offer an additional two USB-C ports, an HDMI 2.0 port, a headphone jack, and a gigabit ethernet port. They no longer offer USB-A ports (the M2 models did).</p>\n\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671793/how-to-connect-an-external-monitor-to-your-mac.html\">connect a display</a>, you can use the HDMI port or a Thunderbolt port. You might have to buy an adapter if your display doesn’t have either HDMI or a port that can connect to Thunderbolt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it? </strong> The $599 and $799 M4-based Mac minis are very fast, and offer the best performance-to-price ratio of any Mac that Apple offers. The Mac mini with M4 Pro offers the same 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 24GB memory, and 512GB storage that is found in the M4 Pro MacBook Pro for $1,399 rather than $1,999 which represented a huge saving and a great way to get a powerful Mac without spending a fortune.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The Mac mini is an excellent machine for most Mac users—new or experienced, professional or general consumer. Plus the price is excellent: if you’re on a budget, it’s a great choice, especially if you already have a spare keyboard, mouse, and display. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 24-inch iMac (M4, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"1361\" height=\"908\" alt=\"Apple 24-inch iMac (M4, 2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/m3-imac-orange-angle.jpg?quality=50u0026strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299 | $1,499 | $1,699 | $1,899\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL76BQ5N?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$1,199 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1858924-REG/apple_mwuc3ll_a_imac_8_core_16gb_256gb_silver_24.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1645786/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1199 at  B&amp;H</a><a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6467303/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$1199 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> In October 2024 Apple introduced the M4 version of the 24-inch iMac. Little has changed since the redesign of 2021, which represented the first major update in more than a decade, with a cleaner design and a choice of seven bright colors (slightly lighter shades for 2024).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The iMac is great for both novices and demanding users. It can handle general-purpose and heavy-duty tasks equally well, although those after a replacement for a 27-inch IMac or iMac Pro might want to wait to see if the rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">iMac Pro</a> ever materializes, or settle for a Mac mini Pro (above) or Mac Studio (below). It’s ideal for someone who needs to buy a complete computer setup (keyboard, mouse or trackpad, and display) and wants to maximize workspace efficiency. The 24-inch iMac is a design icon that will look great in any office. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the iMac cost?</strong> When the M4 iMac Apple dropped prices outside the U.S. The three standard configurations start at $1,299/£1,299 for the entry-level model, $1,499/£1,499 for the mid-range, and $1,699/£1,699 for the top of the range.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> The 24-inch iMac uses Apple’s M4 chip, the same M4 that features in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, but in each case, there is half the storage and the price is $100 less. There are several configurations available as well as build-to-order options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M4, 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16GB memory, 256GB SSD, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, $1,299/£1,299.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB memory, 256GB SSD, four Thunderbolt 4 ports, $1,499/£1,499.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB memory, 512GB SSD, four Thunderbolt 4 ports, $1,699/£1,699.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 24GB memory, 512GB SSD, four Thunderbolt 4 ports, $1,899/£1,899.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: 32GB memory; up to 2TB storage</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are the display specifications?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The 24-inch 4.5K Retina display has 11.3 million pixels and supports the P3 wide color gamut, over a billion colors, 500 nits of brightness, and True Tone. Apple treats the display with an anti-reflective coating to help with readability. The display hasn’t changed since the M1 model launched. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> The $1,299 24-inch iMac 24 has two Thunderbolt 4 ports that also work with USB-C devices. The $1,499 and $1,699 iMacs have four Thunderbolt 4 ports (the previous generation had two Thunderbolt/USB 4 and two USB 3 ports). If you have a USB-A device, you need to buy an adapter, such as Apple’s (<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\">$19</a> / <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ1M2ZM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">£19</a>). If you have multiple USB-A devices and other items, consider a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668894/best-thunderbolt-3-4-and-usb-c-docking-stations-for-macbook-pro-and-air.html\">Thunderbolt hub</a>. The 24-inch iMac also has a headphone jack on the side.</p>\n\n<p>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are built-in. Apple doesn’t put a gigabit ethernet port on the 24-inch iMac—instead, it’s on the power adapter. But that ethernet-equipped power adapter comes standard with the $1,499 and $1,699 models. It’s <em>not</em> included with the $1,299 model, but you can select it as an option at the point of purchase—and yes, that means you’ll have to pay extra for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?:</strong> Since the 24-inch iMac has the same M4 as the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, its speed is very similar. That means it’s fast. It’s got all the speed general consumers need, and it can handle pro applications with no problem. However, the $1,299 model has only one fan inside its body, while the $1,499 and $1,699 models have two fans. That means the high-priced models do a better job of keeping the internals cool. The $1,299 model may need to slow down its performance on heavy-duty tasks in order to maintain a proper temperature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The iMac was greatly improved when Apple introduced the 24-inch model back in 2021, from the design to the display to its performance. But, we hope rumors that Apple may launch an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">iMac Pro model</a> are true. If you are buying one the sweet spot is the $1,499/£1,499 model, which gets you more ports, Touch ID, and ethernet.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2508893/imac-m4-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iMac (M4) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMac Studio (M2 Max/M2 Ultra, 2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"Mac Studio (M2 Max/M2 Ultra, 2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macstudiom2ultra.jpg?quality=50u0026strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Note: This model hasn’t been updated since 2023. An update is expected in 2025. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The Mac Studio joined Apple’s Mac lineup in March 2022 and was updated in June 2023 when it gained the M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It’s a desktop “modular” Mac that’s more powerful (and more expensive) than the Mac mini and similarly specced to the Mac Pro, but lacking the Mac Pro’s expansion options.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The Mac Studio is for the user who wants the maximum processing power. It’s not the only powerful Mac available–the Mac Pro also runs on the M2 Ultra–but it is the cheapest way to get either the M2 Max or M2 Ultra chips. If you want the expansion options of the Mac Pro then you’ll want to look elsewhere, but the Mac Studio brings all the power usually reserved for the ultimate Mac in a small package. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the Mac Studio cost?</strong> There are two standard configurations starting at $1,999/£2,099 (was £1,999) for the Mac Studio M2 Max with 30-core GPU and 512GB SSD, and $3,999/£4,199 (was £3,999) for the Mac Studio M2 Ultra with 60-core GPU and 1TB SSD. There are also build-to-order options that include a 76-core GPU, up to 192GB Unified Memory, and 8TB SSD. Fully maxed out a Mac Studio would cost $8,799/£8,999.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> The Mac Studio uses either the M2 Max or M2 Ultra processors. Apple offers two standard configurations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M2 Max SoC with a 12-core CPU, 30-core GPU, 32GB of memory, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, $1,999/£2,099</li>\n\n<li>Apple M2 Ultra SoC with a 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 64GB of memory, and a 32-core Neural Engine; 1TB SSD, $3,999/£4,199</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: M2 Ultra SoC with a 76-core GPU, up to 192GB unified memory, and up to 8TB SSD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mac Studio does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse, so you’ll have to provide your own, or you can customize your order to include these devices as extra-cost options. Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Studio Display</a> at the same time as the original Mac Studio, but it can be used with third-party displays, too. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Mac Studio has the following ports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>M2 Max: Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back; two USB-C ports on the front.</li>\n\n<li>M2 Ultra: Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back; two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the front.</li>\n\n<li>SDXC Card slot on the front.</li>\n\n<li>Two USB-A ports.</li>\n\n<li>10Gb ethernet.</li>\n\n<li>HDMI 2.0.</li>\n\n<li>3.5 mm headphone jack (with advanced support for high-impedance headphones, a feature lacked by the M1-series models)</li>\n\n<li>802.11ax Wi-Fi 6E (was 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 in predecessor)</li>\n\n<li>Bluetooth 5.3 (was Bluetooth 5.0 in predecessor)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thunderbolt supports USB-C and USB-4. </p>\n\n<p>To connect to a network, you can use the built-in ethernet port, or you can use Wi-Fi, which comes standard.</p>\n\n<p>To connect a display, you can use the HDMI 2.0 port or a Thunderbolt port. You might have to buy an adapter if your display doesn’t have either HDMI or a port that can connect to Thunderbolt. You can connect up to eight 4K displays, six 6K displays, or three 8K displays to the M2 Ultra. The M2 Max supports fewer displays.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> Despite the arrival of the M3 Max, the M2 Max Mac Studio is a very fast Mac at a very competitive price point. Once Apple adds the M3 Max as an option Its speed will be equal to that of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that feature the M3 Max, but even now it costs a fraction of the price: $1,999 compared to $3,199/£3,299 for the 14-inch and $3,599/£3,699 for the 16-inch, making it an excellent choice for anyone on a budget. </p>\n\n<p>Even with the arrival of the M3 Max, the M2 Ultra Mac Studio is Apple’s fastest chip, both in CPU and GPU speed. We expect that when the M3 Ultra arrives the speed gains will be great.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The Mac Studio is ideal for users who use processor- and graphics-intensive apps, such as media production, software development, graphics software, and more. If you find yourself spending a lot of time watching progress bars while you work, you’ll benefit from the power of the Mac Studio. The only question is whether you can wait until Apple upgrades the processors to M3 Max and M3 Ultra, which we anticipate happening around WWDC in June 2024. </p>\n\n<p>The only disadvantage is that the Mac Studio relies on external connections for expandability. If you want a pro-level Mac with the ability to swap expansion cards you should look at Apple silicon-based Mac Pro below.

An update is expected in 2025. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The Mac Pro is Apple’s workstation. It’s designed for professionals who need a powerful and flexible machine. Apple took its time to update the Mac Pro with its own silicon, but in June 2023, three and a half years after the previous update, the company finally came up with the goods. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The Mac Pro is designed for professionals who work with applications that use as many processing cores as possible—video-editing applications, image-editing software, 3D programs, audio editing, software developers, and the like.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the Mac Pro cost?</strong> The Mac Pro starts at $6,999/£7,199 (which is up from the previous generation’s starting price of $5,999/£5,499). That’s for the Tower version, there is also a Rack mount version that starts at $7,499/£7,699. Those are the starting prices, you can choose various configuration options, such as the 76-core GPU and the 192GB unified memory and 8TB storage – just as with the Mac Studio. A fully specced out Mac Pro Tower costs $11,799/£11,999. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The specifications on offer are identical to the Mac Studio with M2 Ultra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M2 Ultra SoC with a 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 64GB of memory, and a 32-core Neural Engine; 1TB SSD</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: M2 Ultra SoC with a 76-core GPU, up to 192GB unified memory, and up to 8TB SSD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Mac Pro has the following ports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Six Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back; two USB-C ports on the top.</li>\n\n<li>Two USB-A ports.</li>\n\n<li>10Gb ethernet.</li>\n\n<li>HDMI 2.0.</li>\n\n<li>3.5 mm headphone jack (with advanced support for high-impedance headphones, a feature lacked by the M1-series models)</li>\n\n<li>Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax)</li>\n\n<li>Bluetooth 5.3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To connect a display, you can use the HDMI 2.0 port or the Thunderbolt ports. You might have to buy an adapter if your display doesn’t have either HDMI or a port that can connect to Thunderbolt. You can connect up to eight 4K displays, six 6K displays, or three 8K displays.</p>\n\n<p>To connect external devices, the Mac Pro has six Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, two HDMI ports, and dual 10Gb Ethernet. But the real draw for creative pros will be the seven full-length PCI Express gen 4 slots, one of which comes with an Apple I/O card installed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> Apple says the 2023 Mac Pro is up to 3x faster than the previous-generation Intel-based model. With support for 192GB of unified memory, Apple says the Mac Pro supports “more memory than the most advanced workstation graphics cards, taking on demanding workloads other systems can’t even process.” Apple says that, like the M2 Ultra Mac Studio, the M2 Ultra Mac Pro can plan an “unprecedented 22 streams of 8K ProRes video.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The Mac Pro provides the processing power that the most demanding users need. We’re talking about production environments, like TV and audio recording studios, animation houses, and software developers.
