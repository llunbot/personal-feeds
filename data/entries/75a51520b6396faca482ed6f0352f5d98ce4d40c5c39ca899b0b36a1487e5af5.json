Keen to make the most of everything the area has to offer, Josh Lewis and Ludo May hit up El Traro bike park in the morning, with a blast down a volcanic glacier in the afternoon. From pumptrack tricks and hero-dirt turns to high altitudes, high winds, and high fives, the riding (and maté) leave Ludo buzzing and bring a tear to Josh’s eye. The perfect way to sign off from SCOR’s Chilean Odyssey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Title photo: Thomas Knecht</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/a-chilean-odyssey-by-scor-ep-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Episodes 1 &amp; 2 here</a>!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/a-chilean-odyssey-by-scor-ep-3-its-a-wrap/\">A Chilean Odyssey by SCOR – Ep.3, It’s a Wrap</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"75a51520b6396faca482ed6f0352f5d98ce4d40c5c39ca899b0b36a1487e5af5","category":"Cycling"}
