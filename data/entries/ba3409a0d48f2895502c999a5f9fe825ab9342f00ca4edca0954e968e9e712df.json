While an exact date is unknown, the rough timeframe is becoming increasingly clear.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> recently said that Apple's headset is on track for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apple-ar-headset-mac-level-computing/\">launch in the fourth quarter of 2022</a>. Kuo originally said that the device was scheduled for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/08/kuo-apple-ar-headset-2q-2022/\">launch in the second quarter of 2022</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-ar-vr-headset-mass-production-delay/\">after a number of delays</a> with kickstarting mass production, it seems that the fourth quarter is the timeframe Apple is now targeting. The fourth quarter of 2022 runs from October 1 to December 31, meaning that an announcement could be less than 10 months away.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is also the chance that Apple could offer the first glimpse of its headset at WWDC in June next year to give developers enough time to prepare apps for it ahead of launch. Morgan Stanley analysts say that the project is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/apple-ar-headset-approaching-liftoff/\">now \"approaching liftoff,\"</a> with it mirroring the timeline of the Apple Watch's development before its launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe headset is expected to offer a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-150-grams/\">lightweight design</a>, two 4K <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/apple-vr-headset-3000ppi-micro-oled-display/\">micro-LED displays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mixed-reality-headset-15-cameras/\">15 optical modules</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apple-ar-headset-mac-level-computing/\">two main processors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/17/iphone-14-and-mixed-reality-headset-wi-fi-6e/\">Wi-Fi 6E connectivity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/apple-mixed-reality-headset-eye-tracking/\">eye tracking</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mixed-reality-headset-15-cameras/\">see-through AR mode</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-ar-vr-hand-gesture-interface/\">object tracking, and hand gesture controls</a>. The device's exact price point is as yet unclear, but some reports indicate that it could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/apple-vr-headset-3000/\">cost customers around $3,000</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor detailed information about everything you need to know about Apple's long-awaited mixed-reality headset, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">see our comprehensive roundup</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/18/apple-headset-less-than-a-year-away/\">Apple's AR/VR Headset Could Be Less Than a Year Away</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-ar-vr-headset-could-be-less-than-a-year-away.2328103/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n-8fQoN4Z24:--tzu27-4-A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n-8fQoN4Z24:--tzu27-4-A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba3409a0d48f2895502c999a5f9fe825ab9342f00ca4edca0954e968e9e712df","category":"Apple"}
