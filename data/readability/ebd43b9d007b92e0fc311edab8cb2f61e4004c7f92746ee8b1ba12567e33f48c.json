Built around proper 29″ x 2.25″ tires and decorated with a multitude of mounts, these frames are undoubtedly an attractive option for bikepackers looking for a lightweight and all-terrain capable ride. Mosaic offer no fewer than six frame sizes, with double-butted and plain gauge framesets to choose from, plus the option to go full custom with geometry to suit the individual rider.</p><h2>Mosaic GT-1X and GT-2X Titanium Gravel Bikes</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking.jpg\" alt=\"mosaic titanium gravel bike gt-2x bikepacking setup\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112934/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-bikepacking-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\"></a></p><p>Mosaic have been offering stock sizing on their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/05/05/mosaic-gt-2-gravel-series-stock-sizing-opens-handcrafted-ti-gravel-bikes-to-more-cyclists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gravel and all-road bikes</a> for some time now, bringing the price of their titanium frames down to something a lot more realistic. We’re pleased to see they’ve continued this with the launch of their new G-Series adventure framesets, designed with much larger tires in mind. Both the Mosaic GT-1X and GT-2X are able to accommodate 29″ x 2.25″ tires. Thus, in terms of terrain, it’s unlikely the bike will be the limiting factor as to where this ride can take you.</p><p>The GT-X bikes run 12mm x 142mm rear axle spacing, with a 68mm English threaded bottom bracket. Both are able to run mountain and gravel-specific group sets (Shimano GRX, SRAM XPLR or SRAM Force Wide) with a maximum chain ring size of 42T (1x only). Cable routing is internal with scope for running electronic shift groups like Di2 and eTap.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing.jpg\" alt=\"mosaic gt-x2 ti gravel bike 2.25&quot; tire clearance unloaded\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1068\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14112312/mosaic-gt-2x-titanium-gravel-bike-stock-sizing-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\"></a></p><p>The Mosaic GT-2X is the most affordable option.
