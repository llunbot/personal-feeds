{"title":"Maybe It Was a Panoramic Photo","link":"https://www.threads.net/@ayfondo/post/C0VzJWCuwnU","date":1701553222000,"content":"\n<p>Faruk Korkmaz posits a seemingly likely explanation for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/01/fake-iphone-computational-photography-glitch\">that “computational photography glitch in a bridal shop” photo</a>: it was taken in Panoramic mode. The subject claims it wasn’t a Panoramic mode photo, but she didn’t snap the photo, and if a photo taken in Panoramic mode isn’t wide enough to reach some threshold, the Photos app does not identify/badge it as such. And conversely, a normal photograph cropped to a very wide aspect ratio <em>will</em> be badged as Panoramic — like <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/12/not-pano-but-labelled-pano-1.jpeg\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/12/not-pano-but-labelled-pano-2.jpeg\">this</a> from my own library — even though it wasn’t snapped in Panoramic mode.</p>\n\n<p>I think it’s quite likely Korkmaz is correct that this is the explanation for how this photo was created; I remain unconvinced that it wasn’t a deliberate publicity stunt.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/02/maybe-it-was-a-pano\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"535f611a9813fc0bc5e9f32744d1161c4e63a09f93751e98982f3ab30eb9b5f7","category":"Tech"}
