That's not too surprising given that visionOS just went out to users four months ago.</p>\n<p>Vision Pro users hoping for multiple virtual Mac monitors will be disappointed that's not planned this time around, but Apple plans to add the next-best thing: Users will be able to take advantage of a larger and higher-resolution single virtual display, including a huge, wraparound ultrawide monitor mode that Apple says is equivalent to two 4K monitors.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030181#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030181&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb7a9d107cc93e2d7b9c6f6652839ac6b5631342bb8f6c3a31ec603794b773f7","category":"Tech"}
