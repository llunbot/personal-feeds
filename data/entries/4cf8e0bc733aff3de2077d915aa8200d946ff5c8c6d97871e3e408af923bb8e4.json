It opened in October 2020 and, as <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/incognito-darknet-market-mass-extorts-buyers-sellers/\">reported</a> by KrebsOnSecurity, closed last March when its operators extorted both buyers and sellers of fees ranging from $100 to $2,000 in exchange for not revealing text messages and transaction records showing their participation in the marketplace. In the 41 months that Incognito Market was open, it facilitated the sale of more than $100 million of narcotics. By June 2023, the site was generating sales of $5 million per month.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025786#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025786&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4cf8e0bc733aff3de2077d915aa8200d946ff5c8c6d97871e3e408af923bb8e4","category":"Tech"}
