I wanted to win. Especially I wanted to win for my father and for my two kids. I’m so happy.’</p>\n<p>Jumbo-Visma’s Steven Kruijswijk spent much of the stage chasing Majka ahead but could never quite bridge the gap, hovering around a minute and a half behind until the end of the day in his unfortunate bridesmaid-never-bride position.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10059/which-bikes-groupsets-and-brakes-did-best-at-grand-tours-in-2021\">Which bikes, groupsets and brakes did best at Grand Tours in 2021?</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAdam Yates (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/team-ineos\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>) launched two attacks on the final category three climb, the second finally sticking to see a 15-second gap open between himself and the group containing the main GC favourites, with limited action on the mountainous day ahead of what’s certain to be an explosive final week.</p>\n<p>Odd Christian Eiking of Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert still wears the red jersey into today’s second rest day. He maintains a 54 second lead over Cofidis’ Guillaume Martin, with Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) sitting third, 1:36sec behind.</p>\n<p>Check out photographer Chris Auld’s photos from yesterday’s stage:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10033/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-15-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 39</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_15_01.jpg?itok=_dOysQeJ\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>39</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10033/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-15-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 15 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>30 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10033%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2015%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10033%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2015%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10033%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2015%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10033%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-15-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10033/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-15-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 39</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_15_01.jpg?itok=_dOysQeJ\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a8bedc5435c4ca8348171140b506a1cb7dfcd2723ce21a74b3fe9458e2662f70","category":"Cycling"}
