At the time, POC’s Procen Air was still very new and novel – an extremely aero-focused road helmet with a TT-inspired shaping, ear-diffusers, and an integrated visor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was used for 15 of EF Pro Cycling’s 41 wins in 2024, but Morton’s use of a mud-splattered Procen Air to win the world’s toughest gravel event may have created the most buzz. Now, POC has released an EF Pro Cycling Limited Edition Procen Air to help fans celebrate perhaps the world’s most loved cycling team while saving some significant watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir1.webp\"><img width=\"1079\" height=\"815\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir1.webp\" alt=\"Lachlan Morton races Unbound Gravel in 2024 using the Procen Air\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir1.webp 1079w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir1-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir1-120x91.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir1-768x580.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The “World’s Most-Loved Team”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>EF Pro Cycling takes a fresh approach to helping its equipment partners market products to the public. Instead of focusing myopically on race results to maximize the appeal of their sponsor’s products, EF Pro Cycling achieves this by striving not only to win races, but to be the “world’s most-loved team.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy is based on initiatives that make the world a better place through the sport of cycling, and a commitment to ethical racing. Prior to this release, the Procen Air was only available in black and silver, so for fans of the EF Pro Cycling, this will be a welcome dose of vibrant color.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Procen Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Procen Air promises to match the aerodynamic efficiency of a time trial helmet while preserving the comfort, protection, and cooling of a road helmet. POC also has a record of creating innovative safety features, and the Procen Air continues this legacy, by by helping riders hear and see as clearly as possible in a noisy and ever-shifting peloton. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to look at the ear diffusers and visor as purely aero-focused features, but these are equally rooted in improving the rider’s ability to sense their surroundings. The visor, which POC calls the Clarity Lens, is designed to maximize the rider’s peripheral vision and can be detached and stored at the rear of the helmet with one hand, using a series of magnetic attachment points. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear diffusers, as we’re calling them, are tuned to optimize airflow and sound management, employing a semi-open design that allows most riders to hear more clearly than they can with their ears exposed, according to POC.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir2.webp\"><img width=\"1164\" height=\"708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir2.webp\" alt=\"Lachlan Morton vists the POC design studio\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir2.webp 1164w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir2-297x181.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir2-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir2-768x467.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Still Ventilated</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than minimizing ventilation to save watts, as seen in some early aero road helmet designs from Giro and others, the Procen Air controls the air coming into its shell to enhance cooling while reducing pressure levels for faster airflow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three intake ports in the front of the Procen Air “drain” the high-pressure zone of stagnant air and reduce the air resistance that must be overcome by the rider. After entering through these ports, air pressure is reduced as it flows through the constricted channels above the rider’s scalp before exiting out of large exhaust ports at the rear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drop in internal air pressure allows the air to speed up a little bit, thus reducing drag while boosting the air’s cooling effect. This phenomenon is known as a Venturi effect and isn’t exclusive to the Procen Air, but is nonetheless a proven and widely adopted design in aero helmets that can’t rely on dozens of vents for cooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While safety, and cooling are important, the Procen Air is first and foremost designed for efficiency at high speed. POC’s testing in the wind tunnel and on the road revealed a 5-watt saving over the fairly slippery Ventral road helmet… at “low speed”. At higher speeds, like 30-60kph, the Procen Air demolished the Ventral, erasing upwards of 18w of drag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are big claims. For an elite road racer 5w of FTP can be the difference between their January and July form. 18 watts could help a lightweight climber hold off a chase group after getting away over the top of a climb. Somewhere in the middle of that sits a noticeable bump in aero efficiency for any rider, especially those switching from a traditional vented helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing, Weight &amp; Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir3.webp\"><img width=\"1252\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir3.webp\" alt=\"A computational fluid dynamic rendering of air flow across the Procen Air helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir3.webp 1252w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir3-297x170.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir3-120x69.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ProcenAir3-768x439.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of performance of course comes at a high cost, which is $430 US, to be exact. You can definitely get a well-vented helmet <em>plus</em> a good aero-road helmet for that kind of money. But, you can’t wear both of those helmets at once, and that’s why POC is betting that riders with this kind of helmet budget will choose the Procen instead. Especially since the Procen promises to balance safety, convenience, and cooling with advanced aerodynamics in a respectably light package, weighing 390g in size medium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does the Procen Air perform in the real world?
