Sure, sometimes they’ve been a <em>little</em> bit sloppy – an earthy hint of mud creeping in at the periphery – but a proper wet Paris-Roubaix is a different beast.</p><p>The 2021 edition – twice delayed by the pandemic, and occupying a new spot in the calendar at the end of the season when the continent is on the cusp of its winter hibernation – will be remembered as one of those vintage editions.</p><p>Heavy rain from the outset. Mud-slicked cobbles. Puddles that verged on being ponds. It’s always the Hell of the North – it’s the race’s whole schtick – but the conditions this year made it extra hellish.</p><p>All eyes were on a couple of familiar faces for the win – perpetual cyclocross rivals turned-road superstars Mathieu van der Poel and Wout Van Aert. In the end, neither of them took home the big cobble.</p><p>It’s often that way at Paris-Roubaix, where fortune plays as big a role as form. An Italian won, for the first time since Andrea Tafi in 1999. Another Italian lost. Plenty of people were happy about both of those things.</p><p>The results were almost secondary to the spectacle, though: the toughest male road cyclists on the planet speeding along the worst roads, in the most miserable conditions, in pursuit of cycling’s most prestigious, peculiar prize.</p><p>I think it’s time we look at some pictures, don’t you?</p><hr><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kramon_ParisRoubaix2021_211003_01311-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Wout van Aert was – like he is in many races – the pre-race favourite.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kramon_ParisRoubaix2021_211003_R_01820-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Mathieu van der Poel was another tipped for the win.<p>Tim Merlier was giving Kristof Ramon absolutely nothing.</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CORVOS_00033604-018-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>It was raining cats and dogs at the race start in Compiegne, but that didn’t deter a bashful German Shepherd with a pink cape from taking in the sights.<p>This Very Good Dog looked a bit worried.
