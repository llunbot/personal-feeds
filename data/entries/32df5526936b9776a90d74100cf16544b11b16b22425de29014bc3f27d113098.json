Maybe you’re like me, after sitting on the couch for hours watching synchronized diving, equestrian cross country, women’s soccer, swimming, and gymnastics, you start thinking, if only I could be as focused as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5663974/2024/07/28/leon-marchand-mens-swimming-france-olympics/\">Leon Marchand</a>. Imagine the records I could break!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you can be, and all it takes is your iPhone. According to an interview with sport psychologist Ross Flowers by <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/can-a-simple-smartphone-trick-give-you-olympian-level-focus/#ftag=CAD590a51e\">CNet</a>, you don’t even need to download an app. CNet asked Flowers for a smartphone “hack anyone can do to start harnessing focus like a professional athlete,” and he suggested an exercise anyone can do, including me from the couch, without signing up for a high-priced fitness subscription. Here’s how. (I’ve rewritten Flowers’ exercise in steps to help you focus.)</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Take out your iPhone and unlock it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stare at the Home screen for 10 seconds and memorize as many apps as possible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write down what you remember and check the results.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’ve mastered your main Home screen, go to the next page, or “go to something larger.” (May I recommend this exercise with Launchpad on your Mac? ) Before you know it, you’ll be breaking records in the 400-meter individual medley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to brag, but I aced this exercise the first time I tried it–I mean, sitting through a day’s worth of Olympics coverage already proves I can focus. But I aced this because I placed those apps on my Home screen in a specific order for a reason: I use them the most, so I’m quite familiar with them being there. Same with Launchpad on my Mac. The second page on my iPhone’s Home screen, however, is a jumbled mess that I’ll never figure out, much less memorize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously, if you’re as hooked on the Olympics as I am, this exercise is a fun thing to do during the commercial breaks. Once you’ve developed that laser-like focus, then you’re ready for the next step: lifelong physical training to become a world-class athlete. I wonder if there’s an app for that…</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"32df5526936b9776a90d74100cf16544b11b16b22425de29014bc3f27d113098","category":"Apple"}
