But that “New” in the title could feel unearned; most of the games, especially the Wii and Wii U/Switch versions, felt like remixes of ideas that had been dreamed up for <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> and <em>Super Mario World</em> decades before. Three-dimensional Mario was for experimentation and pushing boundaries; two-dimensional Mario was for playing a (thoughtfully designed, fun) riff on a thing that children of the '80s and '90s had probably played before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3EgZ0RP\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> is not that kind of 2D Mario game. Yes, it’s still a side-scrolling platformer, and yes, anyone who has played a <em>New SMB</em> game will immediately be familiar with the basics. But the rules of movement and progression have been changed through a combination of new power-ups, additive “badges” that customize your character, and “Wonder Flowers” that fling every single level into a state of psychedelic chaos. It’s two-dimensional Mario that, for the first time in a very long time, is trying something that feels new.</p>\n<p>Nintendo set up a demo session for previewers to get around 25 minutes of guided hands-on time with the game, during which I played a handful of levels from early in the game and a couple of levels from later worlds. I was only able to play a small and pre-selected sliver of what is in the game, but that's enough to say that it definitely doesn't just feel like another <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> sequel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962736#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962736&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ad069777f8897df8907a3b6ccc7b9b60786090fcb3e9ff5cfdaef1f7d0a056df","category":"Tech"}
