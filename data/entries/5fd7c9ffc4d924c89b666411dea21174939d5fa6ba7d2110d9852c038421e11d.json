It's a feature that creators could use to increase engagement or to share content with their most loyal fans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/instagram-locked-reel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/instagram-tests-locked-reels-that-can-be-accessed-with-secret-codes/\">TechCrunch</a></em> noticed that the Instagram Design account recently <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DIJd9Sbx4Xn/\">shared a locked reel</a> with a hint provided to unlock the reel. Entering the code displays an animated banner with the \"coming soon\" wording, which seems to reference the Instagram Design team's announcement that it will soon have a Threads account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs noted by <em>TechCrunch</em>, a creator could share a locked reel that requires a specific word to open, for example, providing a hint that only a follower would know such as a pet's name, which would be a way to share exclusive videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstagram already has a feature that allows users to share a hidden story that can be unlocked with a DM, but the locked reel option does not require direct engagement. Instagram has not commented on the locked reel feature, and it is not clear if and when it will roll out to users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/instagram-locked-reels/\">Instagram Tests Reels You Can Only Watch With a Secret Code</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-tests-reels-you-can-only-watch-with-a-secret-code.2455032/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5fd7c9ffc4d924c89b666411dea21174939d5fa6ba7d2110d9852c038421e11d","category":"Apple"}
