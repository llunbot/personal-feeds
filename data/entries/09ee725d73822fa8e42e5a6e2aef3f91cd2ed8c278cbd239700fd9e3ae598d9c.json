Apple's \"dominant position in flagship smartphones\" could potentially lead to significant growth for the foldable market in 2026, ultimately leading to a record year for foldables. There have long been rumors suggesting that Apple is developing a foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and several analysts believe that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">will finally debut a foldable iPhone</a> around September of 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first foldable ‌iPhone‌ could be between 7.9 and 8.3 inches in size, and it may have a \"clamshell\" design like Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip. A clamshell ‌iPhone‌ would fold in half vertically rather than horizontally, allowing for a full-size ‌iPhone‌ when unfolded, and a smaller, pocketable device when folded.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/\">reported</a> that Apple's long-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> with a display has been delayed again and is now expected to launch after WWDC 2025, likely in the third quarter of the year. The new smart speaker is expected to feature Apple's A18 processor and a 6-7 inch display, with support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, says the analyst. According to Kuo, the delay is primarily attributed to software development challenges, rather than hardware issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been a multitude of rumors about a ‌‌HomePod‌ with a display since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/\">2021</a>, and Apple actually seems to have several products in the works. Kuo's latest report harks back to previous predictions from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, who suggested Apple was developing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/\">several HomePod variants with screens</a>, including one with an iPad-like display and another featuring a screen mounted on a robotic arm. Gurman had indicated these devices were unlikely to launch before 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌HomePod‌ will reportedly emphasize smart home functionality more than current models, suggesting a strategic repositioning of the product line. The idea that Apple is targeting the smart home market follows a recent report by Gurman about Apple developing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">all-in-one home management hub</a> with a square-shaped display, thick bezels, and a hemispherical base similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> G4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe also discuss smart home ecosystems more broadly and the Sonos Ace over-ear headphones as rivals to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>. <a
