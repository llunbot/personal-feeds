{"title":"Exploring the Depths of Buddhist Thought: An Infographic Guide","link":"https://informationisbeautiful.net/2023/exploring-buddhist-thought-what-is-buddhism-what-is-enlightenment/","date":1696581111000,"content":"<p><strong><a href=\"https://geni.us/BuddhismBlog\" target=\"_blank\">An infographical flyover</a> of key Buddhist thought, detailing notions of <a href=\"https://geni.us/EnlightenmentBlog\" target=\"_blank\">enlightenment</a>, higher <a href=\"https://geni.us/BuddhistStatesBlog\" target=\"_blank\">states of consciousness</a> and the principle of ‘<a href=\"https://geni.us/DepOriginBlog\" target=\"_blank\">dependent origination</a>‘.</strong></p>\n<p>Originally created in 2014 for my book, <strong><a href=\"https://geni.us/IIB-KIB\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge is Beautiful</a></strong>, this infographic was part of my personal exploration of meditation (which often leads to Buddhist mind-training techniques). And a reflection of the book’s theme: visualising “knowledge” beyond typical Western definitions. The goal was to visualise not-often-charted aspects of Buddhist thought (with the minimum of Sanskrit terminology).</p>\n<p>» <strong><a href=\"https://geni.us/BuddhismBlog\">See the infographic</a></strong></p>\n<p>Here the graphic has been repurposed for web and updated with fresh understandings and extra details I’ve gleaned in recent years. Especially around the central Buddhist concept of ‘<strong>dependent origination</strong>’ and higher states of consciousness states known as <em>jhanas</em> – and how they may correlate with neuroscience’s modelling of the moment-by-moment ‘rendering’ of consciousness by the brain.

If you’re intrigued, starting with the work of <a href=\"https://geni.us/Shinzenblog\">Shinzen Young</a> might prove … enlightening. </p>\n<p><strong>David McCandless</strong></p>","author":"David McCandless","siteTitle":"Information is Beautiful","siteHash":"0e7035277196509eff939ff4c03ce840d3aed5dc63eafcf609568a61850e5f9f","entryHash":"f91826e60615828878161909412659d71160268583844e16db3607f1775701d6","category":"Tech"}
