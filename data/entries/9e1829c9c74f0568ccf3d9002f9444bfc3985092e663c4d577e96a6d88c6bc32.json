The software is available two weeks after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-releases-visionos-2-4-beta-1/\">seeded the first betas</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/visionOS-2.4-Thumb-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe betas are available to registered developers, and can be downloaded from the Settings app on each device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf the three new software betas, the visionOS 2.4 update is the most notable because it brings <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> to the Vision Pro for the first time. ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features available in visionOS include Writing Tools, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a>, Memory Movie, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a>, Priority Notifications, and ChatGPT integration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update will include a dedicated Spatial Gallery app, which will offer a curated selection of spatial videos, photos, and panoramas from artists, filmmakers, and photographers. Apple is also bringing a Vision Pro app to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> for Vision Pro management, and it will let users find and download apps, add content to a watch list, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith visionOS 2.4 and iOS 18.4, an ‌iPhone‌ can be used to set up Guest Mode on the Vision Pro, making it much easier to let people try out the headset. When a guest puts on the Vision Pro, a prompt appears on the ‌iPhone‌, and the Vision Pro owner is able to choose what apps the guest can use and can see what the guest is doing via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to release visionOS 2.4, tvOS 18.4, and watchOS 11.4 in early April.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/apple-seeds-visionos-2-4-beta-2/\">Apple Seeds Second Betas of visionOS 2.4, tvOS 18.4, and watchOS 11.4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-visionos-2-4-tvos-18-4-and-watchos-11-4.2451212/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9e1829c9c74f0568ccf3d9002f9444bfc3985092e663c4d577e96a6d88c6bc32","category":"Apple"}
