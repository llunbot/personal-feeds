Overall, Pai's FCC awarded $9.2 billion over 10 years ($920 million per year) to 180 bidders nationwide, with SpaceX slated to get $885.51 million over 10 years to serve homes and businesses in parts of 35 states.</p>\n<p>Pai apparently mismanaged the auction, as an <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-announces-over-311-million-broadband-acts-clean-rdof\">announcement yesterday</a> from Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's office said the FCC has to \"clean up issues with the program's design originating from its adoption in 2020.\" The FCC cited \"complaints that the program was poised to fund broadband to parking lots and well-served urban areas.\" The FCC suggested that SpaceX give up its funding in about 6 percent of the census blocks where it's slated to get money. Other ISPs are being asked to give up smaller portions of their funding.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783431#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783431&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54ec06479b7c75b5dbc2982b5c6af1e493324aab23fdb546f089ed156bde64ed","category":"Tech"}
