Shortly after the rollout, software developer <a href=\"https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/2/3.html\">Jeff Johnson</a> collated some early reports complaining about the apparent behavior, noting that devices displaying a Welcome screen after updating were particularly susceptible to having Apple Intelligence automatically re-enabled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIndeed, <em>MacRumors</em> testing confirms this behavior on certain devices. In our tests using an M4 Pro Mac mini, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and M4 iPad Pro – all with Apple Intelligence previously disabled in iOS/iPadOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 – we found that while the iPhones and iPad maintained their disabled status after updating to iOS/iPadOS 18.3.1, the Mac mini automatically re-enabled the feature after updating.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe key trigger does seem to be the appearance of a Welcome screen announcing Apple Intelligence features. We saw it on the M4 Pro Mac mini after updating to macOS 15.3.1, but not on the iPhones or iPad Pro. Notably, unlike typical setup screens, this one lacks the usual \"Set Up Later\" option, effectively forcing you to proceed with enabling the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-intelligence-welcome-screen.jpg\" alt=\"apple intelligence\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" /><div><em>Apple Intelligence splash screen on macOS Sequoia 15.3.1</em></div>\r<br />\nThis automatic re-enabling obviously raises concerns about user choice, particularly given that Apple Intelligence requires up to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/save-up-to-21gb-storage-disable-apple-intelligence/\">7GB of storage space on each device</a> where it's activated. The storage requirement stems from the need to download and maintain local AI models for Apple's privacy-focused processing. Apple in macOS Sequoia 15.3 and iOS/iPadOS 18.3 controversially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/\">made Apple Intelligence an opt-out feature</a>, meaning it is turned on automatically on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/\">compatible devices</a>. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/save-up-to-21gb-storage-disable-apple-intelligence/\">Save 7GB of iPhone Storage Just by Toggling This Switch</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nUsers who prefer to keep Apple Intelligence disabled should verify their settings after updating. On iPhone and iPad, check that the Apple Intelligence toggle is off in Settings → Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri. Mac users can find the toggle in System Settings → Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri.
