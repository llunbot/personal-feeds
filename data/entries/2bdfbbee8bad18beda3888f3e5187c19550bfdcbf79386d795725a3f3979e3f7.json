But today, more than 12 years after the launch of the 3DS, a group of dedicated players has been gathering to ensure that another unique 3DS feature still has a bright and active future after being abandoned by Nintendo.</p>\n<p>We're talking about <a href=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/alone-in-the-streetpass-crowd/\">StreetPass</a>, the proto-social-network that Nintendo devised to let 3DS owners instantly and silently exchange Mii avatars (and some basic information) when two consoles get close enough to communicate wirelessly. Those exchanged Miis can then be used as companions in simple minigames, like tiny board-game pieces crafted to look like 3DS-owning friends and strangers you pass on the street.</p>\n<p>Even as most portable gamers have given up their 3DS consoles for the Switch or Steam Deck, thousands of 3DS fans have met at various events this year to trade StreetPass \"tags\" with their nostalgic brethren. The next such set of gatherings will take place on \"StreetPass Halloween,\" when participants are encouraged to throw a system in their candy bag, leave one on and idle near a candy distribution door, or even just drive slowly around town with a 3DS in the front seat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979887#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979887&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2bdfbbee8bad18beda3888f3e5187c19550bfdcbf79386d795725a3f3979e3f7","category":"Tech"}
