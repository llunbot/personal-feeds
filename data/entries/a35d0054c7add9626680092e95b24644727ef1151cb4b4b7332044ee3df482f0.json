To which, Race Face answers <em>hold my beer</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By combining a dual concave design with tall (but adjustable) pins and a low-profile design with no bearing bump, they’ve made a flat pedal for people who <em>don’t</em> want clipless but <em>do</em> want their feet glued to the platform on rowdy terrain and big jumps. They call it “Locked-in Flats” and here’s how they do it…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2.webp\"><img width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2.webp\" alt=\"top view of new race face turbine flat pedal.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to their footloose and fancy free Atlas pedal, which has milder concavity and smaller pins for riders who like to dab and dance as they shred the descents, the new Turbine pedal is for riders who step on and don’t want their feet to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-concave-diagram.png\"><img width=\"1591\" height=\"1016\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-concave-diagram.png\" alt=\"diagram showing dual concavity of new race face turbine flat pedal.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-concave-diagram.png 1591w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-concave-diagram-297x190.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-concave-diagram-1536x981.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-concave-diagram-120x77.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-concave-diagram-768x490.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, they combined 11 pins with a dual concavity machined into the platform. There’s a big 3mm concave dip in the middle (compared to 1.2mm for the Atlas), and it’s concave in both fore/aft and inboard/outboard directions. Your shoe sinks into the pedal as you press on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3.webp\"><img width=\"2200\" height=\"1466\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3.webp\" alt=\"new race face turbine flat pedal under a riders shoe.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-3-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That means it also helps you climb, since you can pull through a little more on the down stroke when pedaling. And you’re less likely to get bucked off when hammering through rough sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why they went with a smaller inboard bearing. This eliminates any bearing bump or bulge, which lets it have a narrower Q-factor for a more natural pedaling feel and better biodynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They spin on an inboard bushing and outboard bearing. That doesn’t sound like much, but they tested them to 1,000,000 rotations, had no signs of wear, and then gave up because they didn’t want to run down the testing machine. And, like all of Race Face’s products, they have a lifetime warranty, <em>soooo</em>…do your worst.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-shoe-platform-diagram.png\"><img width=\"1397\" height=\"781\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-shoe-platform-diagram.png\" alt=\"diagram showing shoe fitment shape of new race face turbine flat pedal.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-shoe-platform-diagram.png 1397w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-shoe-platform-diagram-297x166.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-shoe-platform-diagram-120x67.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-shoe-platform-diagram-768x429.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The design is a bit narrower at the back, wider at the front, to mimic the shape of your shoe’s soles and provide solid support. Because that shaping is reversed on the bottom side, it’s narrower where it’s more likely to strike the ground, and angled to help deflect off rocks, roots, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4.webp\"><img width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4.webp\" alt=\"side profile view of new race face turbine flat pedal.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-race-face-turbine-flat-pedal-4-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedals come with four spare pins and 44 pin washers, letting you reduce pin height by up to 0.8mm, which, <em>um</em>, isn’t much.
