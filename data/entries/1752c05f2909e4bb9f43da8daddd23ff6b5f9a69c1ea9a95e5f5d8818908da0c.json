While this press release had a lot of hand-waving feel-good New Year‚Äôs resolution words in it, two words caught my attention: Free burritos.</p>\n<p>However, the deeper I dug into this, the more fascinating it was. I promise, this is hilarious. And somehow sports tech related.</p>\n<p>You see, Strava and Chipotle have come up with a challenge whereby the person who logs the most reps of a given segment (Jan 1st to Jan 31st, 2024), wins a year‚Äôs worth of burritos. Well‚Ä¶technically speaking, <a href=\"https://www.chipotle.com/strava-segment-challenge\">it‚Äôs defined as</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The winners of each Segment Challenge will receive ‚ÄúLifestyle Bowls for a Year‚Äù (as defined below). Each ‚ÄúLifestyle Bowls for a Year‚Äù prize consists of Chipotle Rewards credits good for one (1) free regular entr√©e per week for a year, or a total of up to fifty-two (52) regular entr√©e items. The approximate retail value (‚ÄúARV‚Äù) of the Lifestyle Bowls for a Year Prize is Five Hundred and Seventeen Dollars and Forty Cents ($517.40). The ARV of all prizes is $3,104.40.</p>\n<p>For clarity purposes, ‚Äúregular entr√©e item‚Äù means a burrito, burrito bowl, quesadilla (only available through digital orders), single order of tacos, or salad, subject to availability. Does not include kid‚Äôs meals or three pointers. The Chipotle Rewards credits will expire one (1) year from the date that the Chipotle Rewards credits are delivered to a Chipotle Rewards account. A free Chipotle Rewards account is required to claim the prize. If a winner does not have a Chipotle Rewards account, the winner can create one for free at the time of award.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to the segments in question, Strava &amp; Chipotle have selected six different segments, which appear to be linked to start or end at various Chipotle stores. <a href=\"https://www.chipotle.com/strava-segment-challenge\">These Strava Segments are as follows:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://strava.app.link/Chipotle_LA_Segment\">Chipotle LA Segment</a>: 0.3km / Flat<br />\n<a href=\"https://strava.app.link/Chipotle_NYC_Segment\">Chipotle NYC Segment</a>: 0.3km / 3% grade<br />\n<a href=\"https://strava.app.link/Chipotle_DC_Segment\">Chipotle DC Segment</a>: 0.28km / -2% grade<br />\n<a href=\"https://strava.app.link/Chipotle_Chicago_Segment\">Chipotle Chicago Segment</a>: 0.33km / Flat<br />\n<a href=\"https://strava.app.link/Chipotle_Columbus_Segment\">Chipotle Columbus Segment</a>: 0.32km / 2% grade<br />\n<a href=\"https://strava.app.link/Chipotle_Denver_Segment\">Chipotle Denver Segment</a>: 0.32km / Flat</p></blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, they‚Äôre all about 300-meters long, with zero to barely any incline/decline. Keep in mind that while DC‚Äôs segment is downhill, in order to repeat it, you‚Äôve gotta go back uphill each time. Also note, that you need to tap on the register for each segment you want to suffer on.</p>\n<p>In order to track all this madness, Strava is using the ‚ÄòLocal Legends‚Äô feature, which basically highlights the person who does the most iterations of that segment. I wrote a thing about it a few years back, when I <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/06/strava-rolls-out-new-local-legends-feature-heres-how-it-works-in-action.html\">took that crown for the massive Col in Amsterdam</a>.</p>\n<p>After the first open/known day of data, zero people cared in Washington DC. Like, literally nobody made an effort on the first day. Likewise for Columbus, which seems ripe for someone to wake up and at least make a half-hearted attempt. Meanwhile, in New York City and LA, a few runners put in respectable Day 1 efforts of roughly a dozen laps each (and then <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/3137330\">one NYC individual upped that to 51 laps by Day 2, he appears legit</a>). One person in Chicago showed up too, with an equally good start of 20 laps of the segment on Day 1.</p>\n<p>However, for the folks in Denver, it began as all-out war on Day 1, and has escalated quickly since then. All of this is taking place at the home of the first Chipotle, and the segment in question is up/down a residential street (seen later in the post).</p>\n<p><img title=\"DenverChipotle.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/01/DenverChipotle.png\" width=\"719\" height=\"381\" /></p>\n<p>To begin this battle of stupidity, a duo of athletes ran together, <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/25978283?num_entries=10\">Andrew Berndt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/24807481\">Sam Werner</a>. Andrew logged 15km of nothingness sidewalk, while Sam did nearly 19km of repeats. Notably, though, neither of these guys just walked for hours. Instead, they made a legit workout out of it, including hitting the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10482740832/segments/3177419783388297094\">KOM/CR with a pace of 2:12/km</a> (3:30/mi), and an average pace of 4:20km/7:05mi ‚Äì of which is harder to do than you think given they simply went back and forth with average paces slower due to the 180* turns each time.</p>\n<p><img title=\"ChipotleDay1.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/01/ChipotleDay1.png\" width=\"504\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Andrew kept it simple with his activity naming, as well as the declaration ‚ÄúThat KOM ain‚Äôt going down‚Äù, which means‚Ä¶it‚Äôs certainly going down. This is Denver after all, with the greater metro area home to some of the fastest runners in America. However, the winner here isn‚Äôt about speed, it‚Äôs about sustained stupidity. There are no free burritos for the KOM. Instead, it‚Äôs all about the total quantity of times you run this segment:</p>\n<p><img title=\"ChipotleSegment.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/01/ChipotleSegment.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"437\" /></p>\n<p>And Andrew also correctly responded to questions from his concerned fanbase that, <em>‚Äú..it‚Äôs all about attempts for the year üåØ supply ‚Äî this was just an effort to assert some dominance on day 1!‚Äù.</em></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sam noted in the description of his upload that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I just need to do this like 500 more times to get free chipotle for a year! Honestly less boring than the track, given the mortal peril from drivers. 2x((5√ó200/0:15/200/400jog), 400 hard). All at mile pace effort, though distances were probably a bit short</p></blockquote>\n<p>I noticed that on Day 2, <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10489473016\">Andrew decided to make loops out of it</a>, wrapping around Chipotle seen above, rather than going up/down the same street. This adds a<a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10485699421\"> bit of mileage for the extra half-block at each end, but avoids having to do 180* stops each set.</a> Albeit, the segment does include car dodging across one quiet residential street.</p>\n<p>Another slate of fast runners made their intentions known as well, including <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/3944898\">Mark Maguire</a>, who was actually the first person to lay down some serious segment mileage, including both initial Local Legend and a new CR/KOM. Beyond that, <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10483048672\">he even did a TrainerRoad</a> workout and titled it appropriately:</p>\n<p><img title=\"TrainerRoad.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/01/TrainerRoad.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the early bird lost his Local Legend status, and currently sits in <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/challenges/Chipotle-Denver-Segment\">3rd place with 34 attempts</a>. However, I‚Äôm concerned that Mark appears to be a triathlete. He got a 2,500m swim in yesterday, but followed it up with only 4KM of walking laps on the Chipotle Segment. So while he clearly has the athleticism to be in the running, his multi-sport abilities are currently a liability in this competition.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve then got Garret clocking up a mere 7 reps on their first day. However, <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10482240820/overview\">his description threatened to do 110-mile</a> weeks for the rest of the month, if that‚Äôs what it takes.</p>\n<p><img title=\"GarretThreats.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/01/GarretThreats.png\" width=\"719\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Just so we‚Äôre clear Garre: At the current rate, it does indeed appear that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take. One of the commenters on his post accurately surmised that ‚ÄúChipotle don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôve done‚Ä¶‚Äù. And the following day, Garret got distracted running 24KM of non-burrito mileage. He might be a DNF already, or, he could spring back into things ‚Äì only time will tell.</p>\n<p>Thus at the moment, it appears Sam and Andrew are ready to duke it out. Yesterday, Sam commented after his ‚ÄúTruly hoping the 49 in 2 days deters anyone from trying!‚Äù. But he didn‚Äôt learn anything from Andrew‚Äôs KOM declaration, and Andrew himself took out Sam, now sitting at 63 segments. Also, he had time afterwards to create some custom logo-work for this effort. Maybe he‚Äôll create t-shirts too.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Andrew61Segments.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/01/Andrew61Segments.png\" width=\"510\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>This could end up being an incredibly fascinating challenge. When you‚Äôve got at a smattering of clearly very capable runners all vying for a year‚Äôs worth of free Chipotle, shit‚Äôs gonna get real. I mean, both the literal and figurative ways. Any bets on the ultimate winning number of repeats?</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, over on Team Free Guac, you can unlock that achievement with far less pain than running a gazillion loops of a random street in Denver. To do that <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/challenges/4164\">you‚Äôve gotta register for this challenge here</a>, then upload two things a week to Strava. From there, the first 75,000 people to redeem the code in February get a side of free guac.</p>\n<p>But obviously, and far more importantly, I‚Äôll circle back at the end of the challenge to see just how many laps these folks did.</p>\n<p>With that ‚Äì thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"1752c05f2909e4bb9f43da8daddd23ff6b5f9a69c1ea9a95e5f5d8818908da0c","category":"Cycling"}
