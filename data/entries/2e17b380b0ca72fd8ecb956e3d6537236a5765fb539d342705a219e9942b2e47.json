This suit (joined by 16 other attorneys general, mostly of blue states) has a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-lawsuit-against-apple-monopolizing\">political element to it</a>, in the sense of trying to send a message that your government is looking out for your rights and protecting you from big, bad tech companies.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when that collides with a product that has extremely high customer satisfaction ratings? Those of us in the know are well aware of all the ways that Apple plays hardball, and understand that the company is so powerful that really the only way it will be convinced to change its ways is under threat of government intervention. But will American iPhone users feel like the government is on their side, in taking on an American tech giant that makes a product they actually enjoy using?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/21/snell-us-vs-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2e17b380b0ca72fd8ecb956e3d6537236a5765fb539d342705a219e9942b2e47","category":"Tech"}
