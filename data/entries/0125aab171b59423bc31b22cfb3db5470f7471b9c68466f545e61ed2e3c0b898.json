Built around a common battery platform (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/\">which used to be called Ultium</a>), the midsize SUV has been on sale for about three years now, and for model year 2026, there's a new version available, the first Cadillac EV to wear the V-series badge.</p>\n<p>\"V-Series captures the spirit of Cadillac, embodying our relentless pursuit of engineering excellence through our racing and production vehicles,\" said John Roth, vice president of Global Cadillac. \"LYRIQ-V takes this commitment a step further in the EV era, pushing our performance pedigree of V-Series to new heights with a powerful, personalized and high-tech driving experience that fits perfectly into our customers' lives,\" Roth said.</p>\n<p>As with other Cadillac V-series cars, you can expect a much higher power output than the base models. In this case, that's a hefty 615 hp (459 kW) and 650 lb-ft (880 Nm)â€”not quite double the output of the single-motor Lyriq we drove back in 2023. The Lyriq-V uses a pair of motors to achieve that output, powered by the same 102 kWh battery pack as in the normal Lyriq.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/cadillac-gives-the-lyriq-a-race-car-inspired-glow-up/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/cadillac-gives-the-lyriq-a-race-car-inspired-glow-up/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
