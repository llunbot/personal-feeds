With plenty of thoughtful updates and details, could the Ripley get much better? The short answer is yes, but <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/spencerjharding/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=ee450503-e3ff-46ce-8225-df1295082e72\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer</a> might be the only person who isn’t happy about the straight top tube…</em></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-44.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.ibiscycles.com/bikes/ripley\"> Ibis Ripley</a> has been through many iterations, in its carbon form as well as its aluminum <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ibis-ripley-af-review/\" target=\"_blank\">AF</a> version, evolving from what used to be called a long-travel XC bike to the unfortunately-named “downcountry” – and now, finally, I hope that we can leave that nomenclature in the past. The newest Ripley is a great all-around trail bike. Sporting 10 mm more suspension front and back from the previous generation and geometry that makes it ride like a longer travel bike, the Ripley transcends its past and blossoms into a new era.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering, didn’t Travis already review the longer travel <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ibis-ripmo-v3-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Ripmo</a>? That is true, he did, and the Ripley and Ripmo share the same front triangle, so what could be so different? Travis is very keen on his reach staying close to 500 mm, and thus he reviewed a size large Ripmo. I, on the other hand, have been craving longer and longer top tubes, and when I saw the new Ripley’s XL frame had a whopping 540 mm reach, I was intrigued. Please read Travis’ <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ibis-ripmo-v3-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">review;</a> he is a master at explaining tech and suspension in a way that I am not. Travis loved the Ripmo and said he would highly recommend it to fellow riders, and I will echo that.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: I found the Ripley to be every bit as great as Travis found the Ripmo, but I wanted to touch the outer limits of a rideable reach measurement. I found a few issues that have since been addressed, making the Ripley even harder to find fault with.</p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$5,000-$8,200 ($7,800 as reviewed, with Deore XT build and upgraded Industry 9 carbon wheels )</li>\n<li>Full carbon frame and rear triangle</li>\n<li>DW Link suspension</li>\n<li>Weight: 29 lb 12 oz (XL as reviewed, no pedals)</li>\n<li>Shares the same frame as Ripmo, which can be swapped by changing the linkage</li>\n<li>Updated travel: 140 mm front/130 rear</li>\n<li>Downtube storage</li>\n<li>New extra medium size</li>\n<li>Lifetime warranty</li>\n<li>29″ wheels or 29″/27.5″ via flip chip</li>\n<li>Fits full-size 26oz water bottle in all sizes except small</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-15.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-15.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-16.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-16.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-18.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-18.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Frame Details</h3>\n<p>The elephant in the room is that lack of a swooping top tube on the latest Ripley. People were complaining about the swoopy TT in my Ripley AF review and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ibis-dv9-hardtail-29er-review/\" target=\"_blank\">DV9 review</a>. While I can accept the accusations of the swoop being ugly, that swoop provides for extra framebag space, which was one of the main selling points for my purchasing and still owning my Ripley AF. The straight top tube looks better, but it comes at a cost for using a framebag.</p>\n<p>Keeping in step with the times, Ibis has added downtube storage to the Ripley. The door latch is simple and easy to use. I stuffed my OneUp pump into one of the provided Cotopaxi bags and proceeded to jam a full-size butyl tube in the remaining space. I never heard a rattle or felt anything move during the months of reviewing the bike. The space is ample for storing occasionally-needed items and maybe, just maybe, that makes up for the small loss of framebag storage.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Luckily, Ibis shirked conventions by opting to not allow <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/headset-cable-routing/\" target=\"_blank\">headset cable routing</a>. I’m still very much in favor of either hiding everything or being totally external. The Ripley stays right in the middle with standard internal routing that most have come to expect. The frame has full sleeving for the internal routing, making the operation simple and clean, with one exception: the BikeYoke Revive uses a proprietary 3 mm housing, rather than the standard 4 mm shift housing that many droppers use. The 1 mm difference causes the dropper post housing to rattle in the frame, creating a distracting noise in an otherwise masterfully crafted quiet experience. Turns out I wasn’t the only one with this issue, and Ibis has swapped back to standard 4 mm housing moving forward.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-21.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-21.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-29.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-29.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Ripley has a flip chip to allow a mullet setup with a 27.5″ wheel in the rear. The chip allows for zero compromise in geometry, to which I say bravo, this is how it should be. While I did not get a chance to try a slightly smaller wheel, this being a very large and long XL frame, I was tempted more than ever to try such a setup.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-24.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Ibis also updated the upper linkage on this latest iteration. Gone is the large clevis link and the pivot has been moved in front of the seat tube. I used to regularly crunch errant rocks flung onto the “loam shelf” of my Ripley AF, making me hesitant to consider a carbon upgrade. With the new linkage design and protective flap over the lower linkage, there is much less chance of rocks getting stuck and crunched in the linkage. Nonetheless, I still had a few small rocks find their way into the new linkage, producing heartbreaking crunching noises as the rock was ground against the frame. I’m still a bit hesitant about carbon for full suspension due to this, but the Ripley churned up the rocks with no damage to the frame.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Ripley frame features well-executed padding all around the drivetrain to keep any errant chain slap from being noisy. The bevels on the curves of the frames are beautifully scalloped. The matte Green Flash paint scheme sparkles in an understated (rather than ostentatious) gleam. It is a darn good lookin’ bike, ’nuff said.</p>\n<h3>Build Spec</h3>\n<p>I have praised Ibis’ build specs in the past for putting money where it matters and not offering bikes with low-end “take off” or “throw away” parts. This Ripley, at $7,800, offers spec as solid as can be. The Deore XT level build I got to review sits dead center between Deore on the low end and SRAM XO AXS on the high end. It has been a while since I got to ride a review bike with cable-actuated shifting, which is a sentence I never imagined I would write.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-14.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-14.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-26.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-26.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-26.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-26.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-34.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Deore XT is just solid. It works great. The brakes stop predictably and modulate in line with the great experience I have come to expect from Shimano hydraulic brakes.

The 35 mm stem works especially well with the long reach of the Ripley, and it is also available in a 50 mm length for those that might need it. The Blackbird bars have a cool trick where the end of the bars are threaded to allow for inserts to change the bar width. Each insert is 25 mm long, allowing for either a 750 mm or 800 mm bar width. That might be too large a jump if you are very specific about your bar width, but I guess one could cut down the inserts. If you need narrower than 750, I would recommend a different bar. I find 800 mm to be a bit narrow for my taste and with the inserts there is no safe way to extend the bars so I was stuck at 800. It’s a cool idea if you might sway between a narrow bar for certain trails, then back to a wider bar for another. Both widths are too narrow for me, so I just left it at 800 mm.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-28.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-28.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-30.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-30.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The fitment of the dropper post on my review Ripley gave me the most issues, as I already mentioned the rattling 3 mm housing. After talking to the head of engineering, all of my issues have been seen and addressed. I got a review bike where the dropper tunnel was molded too long and did not allow for full insertion. I have been told that this issue has been resolved and the 213 mm droppers fit fully inserted in both the XL and L frames. Fitment and rattling not withstanding, the BikeYoke Revive is one of the nicest and most reliable dropper posts I’ve been lucky enough to use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The upgraded wheelset on this bike is perfection; Industry Nine Classic Hydra hubs laced with j-bend spokes to Ibis S35 carbon rims. This wheelset has insane engagement, wide 35 mm internals for big tires, and the strength (and warranty) of carbon rims. No notes.</p>\n<p>The Ripley comes with a mix of Maxxis tires with EXO casings; a DHR II on the front (to no one’s surprise), but a Rekon on the rear wheel, to my surprise. The Rekon is a great tire, but I would count it more on the XC/bikepacking end of the spectrum. It has been an extremely dry winter here in Tucson, so trails are even more dusty and loose than normal. I found the Rekon trying to cling to what little traction was available multiple times. The Rekon would be the kind of spec I would have expected on an earlier version of the Ripley, but not this much rowdier modern iteration. I had no flats, punctures, or issues with either tire, but I would have liked a bit more bite out of a rear tire for how I was riding the Ripley.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-9.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-20.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-20.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Full Fox Factory shocks get a double thumbs up from me.

Large 29er wheels, long/low/slack geo, and an XL frame all led to a sizeable bike that was tough to navigate through techy uphills. This remains true for the latest Ripley, though the steepening of the seat tube helps considerably. The incredible engagement of the I9 Hydra hubs also helps in this department; while the sheer length of the bike can be hard to manage in tight corners, the advances in hub engagement and the steep seat tube make for greater climbing ability.</p>\n<p>The new Ripley also sees an increase of 10 mm in the rear travel from previous models, up from 120 to 130 mm. The DW-Link suspension is famed for its balance as a suspension platform. With the jump to 130 mm travel, I have felt a slight increase in bob from pedal input on long climbs, which I was able to remedy by increasing the firmness of the Open setting on the shock.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-31.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I am as satisfied with the current DW-Link as I was years ago, it is a simple and elegant suspension design that still holds up to modern standards.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-43.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Descending</h3>\n<p>With the suspension increasing from 130 to 140 mm on the latest iteration, a slacker head tube angle, and longer wheelbase/reach, you know the new Ripley is gonna descend above its class. That same slight pedal bob I mentioned in the previous section translates to better small bump compliance overall. The much longer top tube lent itself to a more planted feeling than my experience on the previous generation, but not so much that I found it lacking in playfulness. The Ripley still wants to be a jibby, playful bike, it’s just got a bit more margin for error when you start goofin’ too hard. The only sacrifice is the how easy the bike is to manual, with the bars getting even farther from the saddle, the leverage needed to get the front wheel off the ground is getting increasingly harder.</p>\n<p>I kept pushing the Ripley and it just soaked everything up without any hint of a harsh bottom out. I used all the travel on this bike throughout my testing; drops, rocks, chunder gardens – you name it, the Ripley can hang. In short; big bike go fast, ride goooood!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Peak of Geometry Inflation</h3>\n<p>Have we reached the peak of geometry inflation? Companies seem to be settling into a new normal for bike geo and I’m not seeing much progression outside of the (now) established norms. Barring some change in suspension offset or another parts standard, I don’t know what the “next big thing” will be in bike geo.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.40%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.40%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.40%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.40%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.52%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.52%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.52%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-02-27-at-8.24.52%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The XL Ripley is an outlier with its 540 mm reach, which was one of the main reasons I wanted to review it. Reach is a very inaccurate number to base much of anything on, but it has become a guiding light for bike sizing as of late. It is a number I look to for my interest in a bike. After spending some time on the very large and long Esker Smokey, I wanted to see how far I could go with these large frames and numbers.</p>\n<p>To start, Ibis recommends being 6’2″ at the low end of the XL sizing; since I am 6’1″, please take all this sizing stuff with a grain of salt. I already mentioned the dropper post insertion being a bit of an issue (this has been resolved by Ibis), and I’ll own that I got an oversized bike for this review, I just had to touch the edge of reach sizing. In spite of my oversizing I found the reach of the Ripley to be manageable and downright enjoyable, but I don’t crave anything longer. The long reach encouraged me to really be over the front wheel and pumping into obstacles that I would normally avoid. We don’t have a lot of wide open no brake descents around here in Tucson, but we do have plenty of techy, rocky, old skool chunder, and for that I value front center over all to keep me from going ass over tea kettle. The long reach and resultant wheelbase kept me feeling secure in the steep and loose sections and pumping through the chunder confidently.</p>\n<p>I will take this opportunity to renew my sole complaint about almost every bike I ride these days: the head tube is too short. The stack height is too low for a bike that supposedly fits people up to 6’7″. With the dropper post slammed and the stem reasonably high on the steerer, there is still saddle to bar drop even with me being 1″ shorter than the recommended height. I’m finding this sizing issue more and more unacceptable. I guess I’ll keep putting 50mm+ riser bars on everything…</p>\n<p>Ibis has spent a lot of effort and time to keep the ride feel consistent across the large range of sizes (including the new extra medium) by having <a href=\"https://www.ibiscycles.com/tech/ibis-geometry-story\" target=\"_blank\">“size specific everything”</a> and I do believe that deserves praise.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-41.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-41.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-41.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-41.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-39.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-39.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Ibis_Ripley_V5_Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Downcountry is Dead</h3>\n<p>“Short” travel bikes are great these days, and the Ripley proves that you don’t need a big bike to ride just about anything. Yeah, it is not a park laps bike… but it doesn’t need to be. Let’s allow downcountry to die. Cross country (XC) bikes are getting longer travel and speccing larger tires, yet they are still cross country bikes. We needed a tweener name for bikes between XC and Trail for a brief moment in time, now let’s lay it to rest. It was always a horrible name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows how good a “short” travel bike can ride</li>\n<li>Sterling spec except the dropper post</li>\n<li>Downtube storage is quiet and works well</li>\n<li>Longer travel moves the frame out of the long travel XC category</li>\n<li>Great frame details, even with a straight top tube</li>\n<li>Able to run 27.5″ or 29″ rear wheel without geometry compromises</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Carbon is expensive, hopefully we get an aluminum (AF) version in the future</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ibis-ripley-v5-review-downcountry-is-dead/\">Ibis Ripley V5 Review: Downcountry is Dead</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f1b6cb01bf38f8f3c2f4e4938831c6b1b3cccc54d5ed1e4ea647e537e12f3bd4","category":"Cycling"}
