If you buy your iPhone outright every year or two, you can usually recoup a good amount of the new cost by selling your old model every time you upgrade to a new one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re in the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program\">iPhone Upgrade Program</a>, you might have an older iPhone languishing in a drawer somewhere unused. Here’s what you need to know about selling or trading in your old iPhone for top dollar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get an old iPhone ready for sale</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has a list of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201351&amp;xcust=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">what to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your old iPhone</a> which is worth a look, and we also cover <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671481/how-to-reset-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">How to wipe and reset an iPhone</a>. We recommend that you should check those guides out, but here’s our own advice for making sure you get the most value for a used iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Take good care of it</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably goes without saying, but your iPhone’s condition plays a huge part in its value. So keep it in a case, use a screen protector, and generally try to keep it in great shape. If your phone shows some wear and tear, you’ll still be able to sell it, you’ll just get a little less. Also, holding onto the original box and including the charger (if it came with one) and cable also helps squeeze a little more value out of your sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Save your data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you get rid of your old iPhone, make sure all the data is backed up and ready to transfer to your new one. A backup to iCloud or the Finder (or iTunes if you are on a PC) is the most convenient way to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/434754/iphone-setup-tips-transfer-data.html\">sync all the data to your new iPhone</a>, and another option is to sync directly from the old to the new iPhone. But because an iPhone backup is pretty self-contained, you may also want to separately make sure your photos are synced to Google Photos, iCloud Photos, or another <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231363/the-best-cloud-storage-services-for-apple-users-2.html\">cloud storage solution</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 6\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Michael Simon/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unpair your Apple Watch</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an Apple Watch, you should make sure it’s backed up so you can unpair it from your old iPhone and sync it with your new one.

The nuclear option here is <em>Erase All Content and Settings</em>; if you’re selling or giving away your phone, this is what you want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be prompted to turn off Find My iPhone and sign out of iCloud if you haven’t already—otherwise iOS’s Activation Lock will prevent the phone’s next owner from activating it. Confirm that you want to erase all the data, and your phone will be securely wiped and restored to factory settings. It’ll go through an update and you’ll be met with a “Hello” screen just like you were when you first set it up. Turn it off and say goodbye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover this in more detail here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671481/how-to-reset-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">How to reset an iPhone</a>.

Note that you need to be connected to Wi-Fi or Cellular before you can wipe the iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to sell your iPhone online</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is deciding where you are going to sell your iPhone. You should start your research at third-party buyback sites. You’ll get an idea of what your phone in its current condition is worth, and then can either take that offer or try to directly sell your phone to another person yourself on Craigslist or eBay. You might want to mention you’re selling your phone on social media like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram first, to see if a friend or associate wants it—you’ll feel better dealing with someone you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buyback sites almost never give you as much money as a direct sale to another person would, but they’re much safer and easier. Sometimes the hassle of a direct sale to another person isn’t worth a little extra money, and you just want to quickly, easily, and safely get a reasonable price for your old phone. That’s where these sites come in. There are lots of buyback sites, but these are some of the biggest and most highly recommended: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>BackMarket </h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18275&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/buyback/home\" target=\"_blank\">BackMarket</a> buys and sells used iPhones and other products. You can get up to $1,017 for an iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB unlocked in good condition, for example. A prepaid shipping label is provided so you can ship your iPhone off to them within 21 days of your quote. The quote is dependent on the iPhone matching the description you have given. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are in the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25205&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.backmarket.co.uk/en-gb/buyback/home\" target=\"_blank\">U.K. BackMarket</a> will also offer you money for your used iPhone. In this case, an iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB unlocked in good condition could get you £634.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Decluttr </h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.decluttr.com/start-selling/\">Decluttr</a> is simple and fast and tells you upfront how much your iPhone is worth, then lets you lock in that price for up to 28 days. If you want to sell you just print out your free label and drop it off with UPS. Once they get it and inspect it to make sure it’s in the condition you stated, they pay you via PayPal or direct deposit the following day. If the condition is not as described, DeCluttr will make a new offer. If that offer isn’t acceptable, they will return the phone free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decluttr buys and sells lots of stuff, including tablets, laptops, wearables, and more. So you can get rid of lots of old gear this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K. Decluttr is known as <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5792&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.musicmagpie.co.uk/start-selling/\" target=\"_blank\">Music Magpie</a>, and they will also buy used equipment from you. Here our iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB unlocked could make us £680. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iphone-12-mini.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 12 mini\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iphone-12-mini.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iphone-12-mini.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iphone-12-mini.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iphone-12-mini.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iphone-12-mini.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iphone-12-mini.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://unsplash.com/photos/YixWSz9TK7M&amp;xcust=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Dennis Cortés/Unsplash</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gazelle</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.gazelle.com&amp;xcust=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Gazelle</a> buys and sells preowned smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other gadgets. They’ll give you an online quote for your item, and then send you a box to ship it to them for free. You can receive payment as a check, via PayPal, or in the form of an Amazon gift card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offer is good for 30 days, and Gazelle will make you a new offer if the item is in worse condition than you described. If you decide not to take the new offer, they’ll send your gadget back, but you pay for the return shipping. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Swappa</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://swappa.com&amp;xcust=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Swappa</a> works a little differently than most other buyback sites. It’s actually a marketplace where you sell directly to other customers—Swappa just verifies the listings, handles the payments (using PayPal), and organizes the shipping to reduce fraud. Swappa collects its fees from the buyer’s end, but the price the buyer actually sees has that fee as well as shipping included. The seller pays for shipping, and you’re on your own to package the item securely, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swappa lists a price range for what has sold recently on its site. You’ll sometimes be able to get more from a sale on Swappa, but selling directly to other people, even with Swappa’s protections in place, always assumes a little more risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670952/how-to-buy-second-hand-refurbished-iphone.html\">Where to buy a second-hand or refurbished iPhone</a> for more options where you might be able to sell it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K. you can also sell your iPhone at places like <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://uk.webuy.com/search/?categoryIds=844&amp;categoryName=iphones&amp;xcust=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CeX</a>,  <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.envirofone.com/en-gb/sell/apple/iphone/search&amp;xcust=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Envirofone</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://webuyanyphone.com/sell-my-apple&amp;xcust=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">We Buy Any Phone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trade in your iPhone for store credit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another convenient approach is to turn in your old iPhone to the Apple Store, Amazon, Best Buy, or Walmart, where they’ll give you a gift card. You might not get quite as much, but these stores also take phones in worse condition than your typical buyer would expect. The big-box stores, for example, will give you a small gift card for an iPhone with a broken screen, while an Apple store will generally just recycle it for you. Sometimes these stores have preorder or launch-day deals as well, so keep your eyes open for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Apple</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-230803-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in\">Apple store’s</a> online quote service is simple, fast, and generally offers pretty good prices for your used Apple gear.

It’s a very simple process, though it can take a couple of weeks before your item gets to Amazon and is inspected, so don’t expect a credit in your Amazon account immediately.

While this can be the most profitable route, it also could be the biggest headache and assumes the most risk. Scammers are everywhere! Follow these tips to help you sell your iPhone to someone else directly:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Only sell locally, never ship your iPhone to the buyer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Only accept cash. Do not take a check, money order, Western Union, or any other form of payment. PayPal is not safe for individual sellers—buyers can dispute the transaction and PayPal almost always sides with them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check out the buyer. Is this a one-off account with no other purchases or ratings? Do they have a social media presence? Are they trying to take the conversation off FaceBook or OfferUp to text messaging right away? These are all red flags!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Meet somewhere public and safe. Many police stations have “Safe Trade Zones” or “Internet Exchange Locations” specifically set up for buyers and sellers to meet. Banks are also a good option. Go inside, don’t handle your business out in the parking lot.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>See and inspect the buyer’s money before you hand over your phone. Check for counterfeit bills or the old “stack of paper in a bank envelope” trick.</li>\n</ol>\n\niOS, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cc8715f86e0f98ebd37234a168330bd092df79a34d14661966539bda72ac2352","category":"Apple"}
