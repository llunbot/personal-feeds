The new PRO Vibe Aero bar and stem aim to fix that by keeping the two components separate, as long as you like narrow handlebars…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2.jpg\" alt=\"pro vibe aero handlebar and stem shown on a bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2.jpg 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The PRO Vibe Aero Handlebar has a flat top section with a slight forward sweep leading to a raised section where the drops meet it. They have an anti-slip coating on the tops, so you can shorten the bar tape and keep them as slim as possible to cheat the wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shifter/brake lever clamping area is angled inward slightly to help you get into a narrower, more aero position when riding on the hoods. The three width options measure just 37mm, 39mm, and 41mm wide here. Weights from 240g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"986\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"pro vibe aero handlebar shown from various angles.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-297x114.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-1536x591.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-120x46.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-768x296.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-and-stem-stealth-cockpit-3-2048x789.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the drops flare out 10º, adding width and wrist clearance when you’re riding low. Reach and drop are size specific:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>37mm – 126mm drop / 77mm reach</li>\n\n\n\n<li>39mm – 128mm drop / 79mm reach</li>\n\n\n\n<li>41mm – 129mm drop / 81mm reach</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem.jpg\" alt=\"pro vibe aero handlebar and stem shown closeup mounted on a bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-vibe-aero-stem-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has internal routing for electronic wires and brake hoses, with ports to feed them directly into the new Vibe Aero Stem, which comes in 80-130mm lengths and has -17º rise. From there, you can route it through compatible headsets and frames for a full stealth look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The handlebar has removable fairings next to the stem, letting you add clip-on aero bars or 3rd party computer mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PRO Stealth Superlight saddle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle.jpg\"><img width=\"2476\" height=\"1580\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle.jpg 2476w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle-297x190.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle-1536x980.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle-768x490.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pro-stealth-superlight-130g-road-bike-saddle-2048x1307.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their lightest road saddle gets a new one-piece carbon shell-and-rails base, plus a few tweaks to the center cut out design, to bring the weight down to just 130g. That’s 15g less than the prior model, without giving up comfort while you’re in your aero riding position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It keeps their “Stealth” design, with a large center channel and wide nose, and tops it with a lightweight-yet-dense EVA foam and PU cover to protect it. Available in 142mm and 152mm widths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pro-bikegear.com\" target=\"_blank\">PRO-bikegear.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-vibe-aero-handlebar-stem-2024/\">PRO Vibe Aero Cockpit Keeps you Stealth, but Comfortable</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9376b1c3efced08f884ef82dd581fa4ebc44eb8fc63b2bf8a30a3930806e9012","category":"Cycling"}
