This guide highlights all of the new additions in the ‌iOS 15‌ Health app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-health-app-overview.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Walking Steadiness</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWalking Steadiness is a new health metric that uses data culled from the ‌iPhone‌ to provide insight into a person's risk of falling down.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-walking-steadiness-health-app.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt uses algorithms that assess balance, strength, and gait, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and walking asymmetry data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌iPhone‌ users are able to opt in to receive a notification when walking steadiness risk is high. The feature also offers up curated exercises to improve walking steadiness.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Lab Result Improvements</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nLab results imported into the Health app from a healthcare provider now include much more information on what the lab tests for, the result received, what the result received means, and how the result compares to prior tests.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-health-app-labs.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt provides a clear visual on whether a lab result is normal or out of range so you can see at a glance if something is off. Lab highlights are shown in the health summary, and important labs can be pinned for quick access.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>COVID-19 Vaccines and Test Results</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n‌iOS 15‌ supports digital storage of COVID-19 vaccination records. Healthcare providers or states can offer a QR code that ‌iPhone‌ users can scan to upload their vaccination records to the Health app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-covid-vaccine-results.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCOVID-19 test results are also supported.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Blood Glucose Highlights</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nUsers who monitor their blood glucose levels can receive highlights that display blood glucose during sleep and during exercise. Apple has added interactive charts to make it easier for users to view and analyze their blood glucose data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Health Trends</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Health app, the Trend feature analyzes shared data and provides details at a glance on how health metrics are progressing, such as heart rate and activity level. In ‌iOS 15‌, users can opt to receive notifications when a new trend is detected in health data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-health-app-trend-info.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Sharing Features</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iOS 15‌ Health app adds multiple sharing options for sharing your health data with your family members. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Share Health Data</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nHealth data can be shared with others starting in ‌iOS 15‌, so family members can exchange health info or a child can better care for an elderly parent. ‌iPhone‌ users can choose specific health data to share, including heart health, activity, labs, vitals, medical ID, cycle tracking, research studies, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-health-app-start-sharing-interface.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen data is shared, only a summary of each topic trend is shared rather than each data point. So, for example, the person who is seeing shared data with will see an overall heart rate summary if heart rate information is shared, but not all heart rate data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-health-app-sharing-details.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nData that's shared shows up in the Health app of the other person so it's quick and easy to access. Whenever updated health information is available, the person who is seeing shared data will receive a notification to view it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-health-app-shared-data-options.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nHealth trend information is also shared when health data is shared, and there's a built-in Messages feature for discussing health changes and metrics.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-health-sharing-trends.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Share Notifications</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nApple will send notifications when shared health info is updated, but notifications are also sent for high heart rate and irregular heart rhythms, so if an elderly parent has an emergency, their caretaker can be notified right away to get them help.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNotifications can also be sent for significant changes in shared data categories, such as a large decline in activity or sleep, which is useful for lending extra assistance to those who need it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Share Health Data with Doctors</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nDoctor's offices and hospitals that participate in Apple's Health Records feature can sign up to be able to access patient data. From there, patients can choose to share their data with their doctors, and data is viewable in a dashboard in the health provider's health records system.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-health-app-sharing-doctor.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is opt-in and participating medical facilities need to use both Health Records and the data sharing features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Guide Feedback</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nHave questions about the Health app features in ‌iOS 15‌, know of a feature we left out, or want to offer feedback on this guide? <a href=\"mailto:guides@macrumors.com\">Send us an email here</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-and-fitness/\">health and fitness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">health</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-health-app/\">What's New With the Health App in iOS 15: Data Sharing, Lab Result Improvements, COVID Vaccine Records and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-new-with-the-health-app-in-ios-15-data-sharing-lab-result-improvements-covid-vaccine-records-and-more.2308958/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LbN9ncaU4OU:5Eg8nr9yvzo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LbN9ncaU4OU:5Eg8nr9yvzo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LbN9ncaU4OU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40385a886610cc93fbb551add0c0391533e4f6895cf56a0a374e11663aa51953","category":"Apple"}
