The tape on your handlebar is quite literally where your hands connect to the bars, serving as a critical contact point between you and your machine and one that can greatly impact your comfort and control. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most bikes’ original handlebar tape is chosen for its low cost, but a well-chosen and high-quality roll will maximize control and comfort while refreshing your bike’s appearance and amplifying its style. While it won’t transform your riding abilities, the right tape can improve performance by providing the desired grip and vibration-dampening characteristics. And like anything else in cycling, handlebar tape comes in a vast array of materials, constructions, thicknesses, surface textures, prices, and color/pattern options to suit varying needs and preferences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most riders, once they find a tape they like, they tend to stick to it, pun intended. That said, if it’s been a while since you tried something new, there may be something better that utilizes more advanced materials and offers a nicer feel. But with hundreds of options to choose from, finding the best handlebar tape can be a challenge. To help, we gathered 15 of the best and most popular handlebar tapes on the market to test and compare. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of testing, we’ve chosen our favorites with our top recommendations listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are all quality options that we feel are worthy of consideration.

Super Sticky Kush</a> tape may have a somewhat misleading name since it isn’t especially “sticky” or “cushy”, but it’s nonetheless our favorite bar tape available at the moment. The Polyurethane surface feels more grippy than sticky, and this feeling remains consistent whether riding in dry conditions, or with sweat and rain in the mix. Rather than being “kushy” the Super Sticky Kush has more of a firm and moderately damped feel that translates to excellent handlebar control and road feedback. The PU top layer is also formulated to resist sweat, harsh climates, and UV rays, helping it resist degrading over time.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the surface, Super Sticky Kush Star Fade Tape features a <em>Kush Foam</em> mid-layer to enhance shock absorption, adding control on downhills, in corners, and on rough roads. We were seriously impressed with Super Sticky Kush’s ability to let through just the right amount of feedback on any road surface. Ripping corners on smooth roads, we could feel every wrinkle in the pavement, and on weathered surfaces, our hands felt suspended just enough to avoid any discomfort.</p><p></p><p>The backing of Super Sticky Kush is also not particularly sticky. This lack of adhesion is a good thing, though, because it means that the tape can be easily removed and re-wrapped, and won’t leave a nasty candy-cane pattern of foam stuck to your bars when the time comes to replace it. Additionally, this tape is super easy to wrap, with just the right balance of stretch and structure to forgive less-than-perfect wrapping technique, but also wrap and hold flat against the handlebars for a uniform surface and consistent feel. It can be pulled extremely tight for maximum road feel, or with moderate tension for some added cushioning.</p><p></p><p>Supacaz has an unmistakable look that forgoes text in favor of an intricate star graphic that is embossed into the surface. The <em>Star Fade</em> pattern we tested is subtle but classy, with just a hint of oil-slick coloring (or several other options) that glimmers in the right lighting, and fades from the tip of the drop section to a flat black as the bars bend upward toward the hoods. It’s a fun but mature aesthetic that adds visual depth to the handlebar without pulling away too much attention from the rest of the bike. Aluminum Star Plugz are anodized and feature the Supacaz logo laser etched into the surface, and the screw into the handlebar tips and expand to ensure Super Sticky Kush stays put. </p><p></p><p>At $45, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsupacaz-super-sticky-kush-star-fade-tape%2Fp%2F216829%3Fcolor%3D361293-216829%26searchText%3D25522-3260\">Supacaz Super Sticky Kush</a> tape is a premium option with top-notch performance and is designed to last for thousands of miles.

The Road version we tested has a smooth polyurethane surface embossed with the Service Course logo that provides great grip in all conditions and has a nice clean look that we think most riders will appreciate.</p><p></p><p>The Zipp Service Course road tape delivers excellent grip, cushioning, and control, for the demanding high-mileage and high-speed racer, or casual weekend enthusiast. The Service Course tape lies perfectly flat, complimenting the sleek lines of your carbon fiber aero super bike, or your classic steel all-rounder. We’ve also had the chance to test this tape on some stock gravel builds and it has performed just as well on rough gravel roads thanks to its great blend of grip and cushioning from the foam backing. </p><p></p><p>Available in classic color options of red, white, and black, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fzipp-service-course-bar-tape\">Zipp Service Course – Road</a> is a high-performance upgrade for your handlebars that will give you the confidence to attack and push it to the limit. At $27, it is priced lower than many tapes that it outperforms and outlasts. Even if it’s never been to a service course, your bike knows you care when you choose Zipp Service Course Handlebar Tape. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fzipp-service-course-bar-tape\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005QSK380/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebartape-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tRunner-Up Best Handlebar Tape\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-nastro-cuscino-bar-tape\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSilca Nastro Cuscino 2.5\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$50.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Polyurethane, EVA Foam</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2.5mm (also comes in 3.75mm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length per roll</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>not specified</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Red, Cyan Blue, Grey, Neon Pink, White</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1196\" height=\"797\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino.jpeg 1196w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Damps without excess bulk</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hard-wearing</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Crash-replacement discount</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Patience is required to wrap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Utilizing advanced EVA Foam, similar to that used in the tires of Formula One cars, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-nastro-cuscino-bar-tape\">Silca’s Nastro Cuscino 2.5mm</a> bar tape damps as well as other bar tapes that are 3.5mm thick, but avoids adding the excessive bulk that limits useful feedback and handlebar control. </p><p></p><p>Nastro Cuscino is not a stretchy tape, so a firm grip and attention to detail are needed to wrap this tape in a tidy spiral. Thankfully, Silca provides a butterfly-shaped piece that covers the clamp of the brake levers, meaning you won’t need to contort the tape all that much around the tight bend behind the hoods. Silca also included a handsome aluminum end plug with their logo laser etched, for a classy and secure finish at the end of the handlebar.</p><p></p><p>Once wrapped, Nastro Cuscino is a beautiful addition to the cockpit area, laying flat along the handlebar, and displaying a unique embossed pattern with no branding. Not only does the pattern look great, but it also enhances grip in the most extreme situations, dispatching sweat and rainwater to help you stay safe and in perfect control. Damping is excellent and hits the sweet spot of taking the edge off low and mid-frequency bumps while tuning high-frequency buzz just enough to preserve useful feedback in corners and at high speeds. </p><p></p><p>At $50, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-nastro-cuscino-bar-tape\">Silca Nastro Cuscino</a> is the most expensive tape we tested but does come with a 1-year crash replacement discount, meaning that in the event of a crash, Silca will discount a replacement roll down to $35. We suspect that once you experience the refined ride quality it offers, the cost will be quickly forgotten.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-nastro-cuscino-bar-tape\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCKXHRDT/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebartape-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tMost Comfortable Handlebar Tape\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F222805%2Fenve-handlebar-tape\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tENVE Handlebar Tape\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$40.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Polyurethane with vibration damping silicone backer strip</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>3mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length per roll</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2,500mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black Grey, White</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1254\" height=\"836\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape.jpeg 1254w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enve-handlebar-tape-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to wrap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Cushy and grippy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Long enough for super wide bars</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Limited color options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderately expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F222805%2Fenve-handlebar-tape\">ENVE Handlebar Tape</a> is one of the most technically advanced tapes available and is thoughtfully designed to maximize comfort, control, and style while being easy to wrap and hard-wearing. </p><p></p><p>Comfort is delivered through a pairing of 3mm thickness along with a silicone backing layer. This tape is ready for the roughest roads and prioritizes cushy comfort over direct feedback making it a good option for Allroad and gravel riding as well. While there is some variability in how thick some tape feels relative to its labeled thickness, we can confirm that ENVE Handlebar Tape adds significant girth to the handlebar, and it wraps every bit of 3mm thick. </p><p></p><p>Stretch is plentiful, making ENVE Handlebar tape a breeze to wrap around any shaped bar, from a traditional round affair to the most aggressively profiled aero shapes on the market. It’s also quite long at 2,500mm per roll, which means it’s long enough to wrap handlebars up to 50cm. Have bars with aero tops that are meant to be left exposed?

This is an especially smart choice for bikes that are ridden in rain or extreme heat, as the “soft touch” surface is highly effective at absorbing moisture while retaining a pleasant feel and providing total control. </p><p></p><p>The Tempo Bondcush 3mm Soft tape is available in 5 colors, but to our eye looks best in black, since the grain of the Softouch material is oriented in different ways along the spiral wrap, and gives the handlebars a luxurious and classic appearance. Wrapping is fairly straightforward, although this isn’t an especially stretchy tape. It does like to spiral and lay flat, so with moderate grip pressure and generous amounts of overlap, we were able to achieve a tidy wrap with little effort.</p><p></p><p>When Tempo Bondcush tape is exposed to heavy perspiration, hosing off the handlebars and patting them dry with a towel after your ride will help preserve the edges of the tape. Acids in sweat can cause the edges of Tempo Bondcush to peel and crack if left unchecked for too long. If this tape has an Achilles’ heel, this is it. Because the soft touch material is so absorptive, it needs to be cleaned regularly, otherwise, it will degrade. It should also not be left in direct sunlight for too long, as it can dry out, lose its relaxing feel, and eventually crack.</p><p></p><p>At $45, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Ffizik-tempo-bondcush-soft-handlebar-tape-black-3mm-thick-f1804001%2Fp986796\">Fizik Tempo Bondcush 3mm Soft</a> is a premium handlebar tape that offers brilliant performance in wet conditions, and a uniquely pleasant feel when dry.

Simply put, it doesn’t stretch…like, at all. That said, once we found the correct level of tension during our first pass, Wraptor Wrap became more easily managed, and after that, wrapping the other side of the bar was a breeze. Once muscled into place, it was abundantly clear that the short period of struggle was well worth it, as our handlebar looked positively regal and felt ready for any condition imaginable. </p><p></p><p>Arundel offsets the embossed logos on only one edge of the Wraptor Wrap, which means you can orient the overlap of the tape to hide or expose the logos. Unlike most other branding, we love the old-world-inspired typeface of Arundel and feel that on the rich matte polyurethane rubber surface, the embossed text adds a bit of depth and class to the Wraptor Wrap when left exposed. </p><p></p><p>On the road, it’s easy to feel why this tape is named after a bird of prey. The grip is unwavering, even in sopping wet conditions, and in dry, Wraptor Wrap offers a supple, effortless grab for perfect control of the bars. To its credit, Wraptor Wrap feels much thinner and more direct than its 3.3mm width would suggest it might. While some other tapes this thick end up blunting road feedback to a fault, Wraptor Wrap filters out the low and mid-frequency vibrations and translates high-frequency buzz into a coherent, palatable stream of usable sensation. </p><p></p><p>This is classic bar tape for classy bikes. It’s not particularly light, and it’s also not flimsy disposable junk that’s meant to wear out quickly so it needs to be replaced. <a href=\"https://www.arundelbike.com/product/wraptor-wrap/\">Wraptor Wrap</a> will enhance not only the look but also compliment the ride quality of a well-built road machine. At just $27.95, it’s surprisingly inexpensive when compared to many other options that don’t match its performance. Just don’t try to wrap it when you’re tired. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.arundelbike.com/product/wraptor-wrap/\">Check Price at Arundel</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tAnother Good Value Handlebar Tape\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Ffsa-powertouch-bar-tape-yellow-187-0002000650%2Fp510612\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFSA PowerTouch Handlebar Tape\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$33.20</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hybrid Cork</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>3mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, White, Pink, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSA-Powertouch.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"673\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSA-Powertouch.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSA-Powertouch.jpeg 673w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSA-Powertouch-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSA-Powertouch-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Grippy texture</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent performance in wet conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No adhesive for easy removal and re-wrappings</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>None</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Ffsa-powertouch-bar-tape-yellow-187-0002000650%2Fp510612\">FSA’s PowerTouch Handlebar Tape</a> is a comfortable, grippy tape that’s all about restoring your bike’s appearance and feel, with minimal fuss.

When it’s time to replace PowerTouch, or if it needs to be re-wrapped, it comes off cleanly, without tearing or leaving residue on your bars. </p><p></p><p>Out on the road, PowerTouch performed brilliantly, with plenty of damping, and a less bulky feel than expected from a 3mm tape. The subtle dimpled texture provided a secure and comfortable grip during sprints, and helped us keep our hands, wrists, and forearms relaxed on rough sections of road. </p><p></p><p>At $33, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Ffsa-powertouch-bar-tape-yellow-187-0002000650%2Fp510612\">FSA PowerTouch</a> is a relatively affordable option that competes with tapes that are 20% more expensive and should last just as long, assuming it’s wrapped nicely and kept clean. If your bar tape has seen better days, replace it with FSA Powertouch and enjoy the restorative benefits of this modern high-performance offering.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Ffsa-powertouch-bar-tape-yellow-187-0002000650%2Fp510612\">Check Price at Performance Bike</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5SIJPT/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebartape-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tRon's Favorite Handlebar Tape\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fcamp-and-go-slow-western-rattler-bar-tape-10107.htm\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCamp and Go Slow Western Rattler Bar Tape\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$44.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Nylon blend with 1.5mm foam backing</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1.9mm (measured)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length per roll</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>3,300mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Western (brown) or Eastern (green) Rattler colors</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1173\" height=\"782\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape.jpeg 1173w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Camp-and-Go-Slow-Western-Rattler-Bar-Tape-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Distinctive looks</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to unwrap and rewrap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Cleans up nicely with soap and water</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super durable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comes in a reusable bag</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderately expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Doesn't come with bar plugs or finishing tape</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Staff writer Ron Frazelle claims the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fcamp-and-go-slow-western-rattler-bar-tape-10107.htm\">Camp and Go Slow Western Rattler Bar Tape</a> is “The. Best. Bar. Tape. Ever.” In fact, he liked it so much that he even included it in his <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-2023-frazelles-fun-faves-for-the-year/\">2023 Editor’s Choice list</a>. That’s incredibly high praise from a man who has ridden A LOT of bikes and used A LOT of different bar tapes in his day. </p><p></p><p>The Camp and Go Slow Western Rattler is a bit of an outlier compared to most of the other products in this review. This is primarily due to the unique styling with the Western (brown) or Eastern (green) Rattler diamond pattern and the texture of the “woven” nylon blend surface. Beneath the nylon surface is a 1.5mm foam backing, creating a tape that’s 1.9mm thick according to our calipers. It comes in two 3,300mm long rolls, which is more than enough for the widest bars, leaving plenty of extra for creating something like a matching chainstay protector on your handmade frame with a custom build. </p><p></p><p>The woven nylon surface texture is comfortable and feels great on bare hands and is extra grippy with gloves, and the 1.5mm foam backing offers a light amount of cushioning. It isn’t super stretchy, but it’s still fairly easy to wrap and rewrap numerous times if you need. The woven texture does get dirty from sweat and grime, but it cleans up nicely and easily with soap and water when it needs a refresh. And, based on Ron’s long-term testing, it seems to be one of the most durable options around.</p><p></p><p>It comes in a nice reusable bag, and while it doesn’t come with finishing tape or end plugs, you probably already have some electrical tape and old plugs at home. At $44, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fcamp-and-go-slow-western-rattler-bar-tape-10107.htm\">Camp and Go Slow Western Rattler Bar Tape</a> is on the more expensive side but we feel it’s got the longevity, and the style, to justify the asking price. Coming from a brand with a name like Camp and Go Slow, this bar tape isn’t aimed at racers, instead, it’s meant for those who want to enjoy the ride and have their bike look awesome while doing it. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=25977&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angrycatfishbicycle.com%2Fproduct%2Fcamp-and-go-slow-western-rattler-bar-tape-10107.htm\">Check Price at Angry Catfish Bicycle</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best of the Rest</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tClassic and Affordable\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcinelli-cork-tape\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCinelli Cork Ribbon Bar Tape\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$20.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Natural cork, Synthetic Foam</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>not specified</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length per roll</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\"fits bars up to 46cm\"</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, White, Blue, Denim, Yellow, Orange, Red, Grey, Light Blue, Natural, Blue Prince, Pink Jersey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1231\" height=\"821\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon.jpeg 1231w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cinelli-Cork-Ribbon-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easiest to wrap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Classic looks</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Doesn't like to lay perfectly flat</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Cork/foam can tear more easily</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcinelli-cork-tape\">Cinelli’s Cork Ribbon Handlebar Tape</a> is a traditional bar tape that gives any bike a bit of vintage styling and a traditional feel at the front end. A mix of natural cork and synthetic foam allows Cinelli Cork Ribbon to perform in all conditions, whether it’s absorbing sweat or rain, or insulating against cold.</p><p></p><p>Due to its seemingly endless stretch, Cinelli Cork Ribbon easily hugs the curves of any handlebar and can be wrapped tightly to provide firm, direct feedback, or more softly to enhance vibration-damping characteristics. The backing is super sticky, so once it’s on the bar, there’s no need to worry about it losing tension. This is by far the easiest tape to wrap in our test group, assuming you get it right the first time. </p><p></p><p>Grip is accomplished by friction on the surface of the Cinelli Cork Ribbon, thanks to tiny pores and the texture of the material. It doesn’t have a tacky, grippy feel like more contemporary tape, but rather a rougher, friction feel. It also doesn’t like to lay especially flat, even if it’s wrapped extra tight. Whether the wavy surface is pleasing or not is just a matter of personal taste, but it’s a feature of the Cinelli Cork Ribbon. </p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcinelli-cork-tape\">Cinelli Cork Ribbon</a> is available in a variety of classic colors that will complement or contrast any color scheme out there. At just $20, it’s an inexpensive way to rejuvenate your bike for the upcoming season and beyond. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Skins DSP Bar Tape</a> is a stretchy, tacky, and hard-wearing tape that’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lizard-skins-dsp-v2-bar-tape-fattens-up-with-new-4-6mm-thickness-in-four-colors/\">available in four thicknesses</a>, from super thin 1.8mm, 2.5mm, and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F199808%2Flizard-skins-dsp-bar-tape-32-mm\">3.2mm</a>, to the chunky <a

version</a> to cater to those with varying needs and preferences. Thinner widths offer super low weight, flatter surface, firmer feel, and ultimate feedback and control, while thicker widths protect hands from rough road surfaces, with a thick, squishy wrap that tunes out road buzz and helps you stay relaxed on long rides. </p><p></p><p>We tested the 2.5mm thickness of the DSP Bar Tape which has a tacky and compliant feel, with a subtle cross-hatched texture to increase friction for enhanced grip. We found that the DSP Bar Tape can feel a bit slick in the presence of rain and sweat, but sheds excess moisture well and returns to its super grippy feel quickly. </p><p></p><p>Wrapping instructions for DSP state that it should not be stretched, but we disagree with this, based on our experience of wrapping it dozens of times over the years. Despite its slightly delicate and flexible feel, Lizard Skins DSP is hard-wearing tape. We’ve never ripped it by stretching it hard when wrapping, nor seen it rip while installed, even after many thousands of miles of service. To finish the wrap, Lizard Skins now provides solid thread-in handlebar plugs with every roll of DSP Bar Tape.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F199807%2Flizard-skins-dsp-bar-tape-25-mm\">Lizard Skins DSP Bar Tape</a> is available in a whopping 16 color options, many of which perfectly coordinate with iconic bike brand colors, so you can be sure to find one that suits your aesthetic. At $45, Lizard Skins DSP is one of the most expensive models available but offers a rare blend of low weight, super-comfortable grip, and hard-wearing durability that have made it one of the most popular bar tapes on the market for many years.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F199807%2Flizard-skins-dsp-bar-tape-25-mm\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X5YJ2T7/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebartape-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fergon-bt-allroad-bar-tape\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tErgon BT Allroad\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$37.95</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>EVA foam, Polyurethane</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2.5mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length per roll</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2,100mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Merlot Red, White Speed, Wilderness Green, Space Blue</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1238\" height=\"825\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad.jpeg 1238w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ergon-BT-allroad-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Customizable wrapping options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Nicely damped </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to wrap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderately expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fergon-bt-allroad-bar-tape\">Ergon BT Allroad</a> tape is 2.5mm thick and made with EVA foam and an anti-slip polyurethane surface, designed to ensure maximum comfort and control on all roads, paved or not. </p><p></p><p>The printed surface pattern not only adds visual depth to the Ergon BT Allroad Tape, but also doubles as a wrapping guide, showing how much overlap is ideal for a firm, neutral, or extra cushy feel.

This flashy tape offers a stellar blend of precise control, all-conditions grip, and long-term durability. </p><p></p><p>Large HiFi logos are embossed in gold on the otherwise black surface, adding tactile and visual texture to your handlebar. The Precision Premium Bar Tape is fun to wrap, not only because the HiFi logo stacks up nicely as it spirals around the bar, but because this tape lays perfectly flat regardless of how much overlap is applied to each layer. It’s not a super stretchy tape but is pliable enough that you won’t be straining to make it behave. </p><p></p><p>The HiFi Premium Bar Tape measures 2mm thick with our calipers and therefore offers a nicely balanced level of cushion with minimal bulk. We also loved how seamless this tape felt along the entire surface of the bar, regardless of hand position. In both wet and dry, with and without gloves, the HiFi Bar Tape performed perfectly and kept us perfectly in tune with the front end of our bike. </p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QC367XH/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebartape-20\">HiFi Precision Handlebar Tape</a> comes with custom locking bar end plugs that finish off the tape job for a super clean and matching look, plus they can be used for future wrapping when it’s time to replace your tape. At $30, this is an affordable tape that is a no-brainer if you’re already running HiFi wheels, but can also be an eye-catching upgrade to any road bike that costs less than many similar options. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QC367XH/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebartape-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Ffi-zik-vento-microtex-tacky-bar-tape\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFizik Vento Microtex Tacky\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$35.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Microtex</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length per roll</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2,350mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Solid: White, Black, Red, Celeste Bianchi, Lilia Fluo, Yellow Fluo, Pink Fluo, Orange Fluo.

The tacky finish adds a sticky non-slip surface for a secure hold in all weather conditions, with or without gloves. </p><p></p><p>The Vento Microtex Tacky Bar Tape is available in seven <em>Bi-color</em> gradient-fade options that will coordinate with any bike for a race-ready and contemporary look as well as eight solid colors ranging from subdued to super bright. This impressive color range means there’s something to suit every preference and likely match any color theme.</p><p></p><p>Wrapping the Microtex Tacky Bi-Color bar tape requires care if you want the color gradient sections to match each other. Overlap less, or pull more tightly on one side, and the color gradient will extend closer to the hood, for example. Simply keeping the wrap tidy and flat is easy, however. With a reasonable level of adhesive applied to the backing, it is also easy to remove and re-apply if needed.</p><p></p><p>Out on the road, we were amazed by how much road feel was transmitted through the Vento Microtex Tacky tape.

It’s a thinner tape that prioritizes grip and feedback from the road over cushioning on rough surfaces. Gecko Grip easily fends off sweat so it can be wiped clean with a wet rag easily after any ride. By taking the time to gently clean Gecko Grip with water and mild soap, you can prevent it from drying out and help it last as long as possible. It’s a tape that feels dramatically better with just a little bit of care and attention. </p><p></p><p>Gecko grip has an interesting texture embossed into the surface, with a continuous grip pattern punctuated with the Arundel script at the edge of the wrap. Placing the script near the edge gives a choice in whether to display the branding or hide it, depending on which way the tape is oriented as it spirals the bar. As mentioned above in our description of the Wrator Wrap, we enjoy the old-world-inspired typeface of Arundel and chose to leave it exposed for what we think is a classy look. </p><p></p><p>We found that the ventilated polyurethane surface and dimpled texture provided a grip that we’d describe as natural, comfortable, and balanced, without any excess friction or sticky sensation in both wet and dry conditions. Being one of the thinner tapes we tested, however, it doesn’t provide lots of vibration-dampening, instead, it has a relatively direct feel that’s best for those riders who enjoy a bit of feedback from the front of the bike and tend to ride smoother surfaces most frequently.</p><p></p><p>Available in 6 classic colors, it’s easy to coordinate <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-gecko-grip-bar-tape\">Arundel Gecko Grip</a> with most bikes’ color schemes. The affordable price of only $22.95 is also one of the least expensive we tested and lines up with the tremendous value Arundel provides in everything they make. If you’re looking for a reasonably priced tape that provides a better grip than classic cork for a similar cost, check out Arundel Gecko Grip.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Farundel-gecko-grip-bar-tape\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006M4RHW2/?tag=brbggearbikinghandlebartape-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Feaston-microfiber-handlebar-tape\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEaston Microfiber Tape\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$30.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Microfiber, anti-shock foam</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Thickness</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>not specified</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length per roll</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>not specified</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Color options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Blue, Green, Red, White, Yellow</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1513\" height=\"1009\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Handlebar Tape of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape.jpeg 1513w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-Tape-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Grippy texture</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Durable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to wrap</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good dampening</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Gel adhesive isn't that sticky (pro or con depending on preference)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Easton makes some of the most comfortable handlebars out there, so it makes perfect sense to apply their expertise in this part of the bike the actual point of contact with the hands.

cycling very seriously and we are fortunate to get to spend lots of time riding bikes and trying different products. Spending as much time riding as we do, we’ve learned that the touchpoints on our bikes are of critical importance when it comes to our comfort. And in the case of handlebar tape, it also plays a major role in our control. As such, we’re always looking for and testing out the best products that can enhance our experience and improve our performance on the bike, handlebar tape included. And, this isn’t a list we’ve just thrown together, instead, we’ve actually tested all of these bar tapes ourselves to see how they perform in the real world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our handlebar tape buyer’s guide, we leaned on the expertise of Bennett Shane to test the majority of the options in this review and sprinkled in a couple of options that are favorites of our staff writers. Bennett is a committed road, and sometimes gravel, cyclist who lives in the Portland, OR area and rides year-round for fun, fitness, and product testing. While he has a racing background, Bennett has shifted his focus in recent years to personal challenges, vertical goals, and long rides through the countryside and mountains of the Pacific Northwest. With over two decades of riding experience, Bennett is very meticulous about bike setup and maintenance and takes pleasure in dialing in his cockpit to perfection with perfectly wrapped handlebar tape. He’s also spent years working for numerous prominent brands in the cycling industry and has an uncanny depth of knowledge and experience using, or at least tinkering with, nearly every product on the market. Spending as much time riding as he does, Bennett deeply understands the importance of the touch points on his bicycles and the role they play in his comfort, control, and enjoyment on every ride. Additionally, Bennett has contributed to our buyer’s guide of the best <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-saddle/\">road bike saddles</a>, bib tights, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-shoe-covers/\">cycling shoe covers</a>, road bike tires, and several other categories of accessories and gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of these handlebar tapes were tested by Bennett over the course of several months during the fall and early winter in the Pacific Northwest. Each tape was wrapped on the handlebars of one of his road machines, ranging from carbon superbikes to boutique steel custom builds, and ridden for hundreds of miles in the wildly variable weather of the PNW. In the home workshop, we analyzed the ease of wrapping each tape, and on the road, we considered the grip (gloved and gloveless) in both wet and dry conditions, feedback, cushioning, thickness, and the overall feel of each tape while riding in the real world. Tapes that were not tested by Bennett were tested by one of our staff writers and used for several months or more. After extensive testing, we compiled this list of our favorites and those that excel in specific ways compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bennett Shane testing handlebar tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bennett-Shane-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Review author Bennett Shane spent months testing the best handlebar tapes on the market, seen here riding with the Supacaz Super Sticky Kush.

So many, that figuring out what you need can be confusing and downright frustrating. It’s important to consider what you want from a handlebar tape, whether that’s cushioning, a super direct/high feedback feel, wet weather grip, or even a fun and funky style. There are lots of variables to consider in choosing tape including thickness, surface texture, stretch, color or pattern options, and, of course, cost. And, comfort on the bike doesn’t stop at the handlebar, so it’s important to consider other contact points like a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-saddle/\">quality saddle</a>, well-fitting <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">bib shorts</a>, and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">right pair of road bike shoes</a> too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape.jpeg\" alt=\"A closer look at the Cinelli Cork Ribbon handlebar tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cork-bar-tape-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Handlebar tapes come in a wide range of materials and textures. Cinelli’s Cork Ribbon tape has been around for decades and has a decidedly classic look and feel. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Material/Texture</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While handlebar tape comes in rolls and often has sticky backing, “tape” is a bit of a misnomer since we are talking about a multi-layered wrap designed to provide grip and cushioning with only the minimal adhesive properties needed to stay secure once it is tightly wrapped. Traditionally, bar tapes were made of leather, cloth, or simple cork-infused foam. Other options used gel inserts to provide cushioning, but tended to be quite heavy. Like all things in the bike world, handlebar tapes have undergone steady marginal improvements over the years and are now being touted as performance upgrades, with claims of reducing rider fatigue. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape.jpeg\" alt=\"The Zipp Service Course bar tape wrapped on a handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zipp-bar-tape-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Many modern tapes feature foam cushioning with different surfaces like polyurethane, often embossed with a logo or texture, as seen on the Zipp Service Course bar tape.

Each tape will have a surface texture inherent to the material, like Microfiber/synthetic leather, polyurethane, or Microtex, or that has been added during the manufacturing process. Different materials, textured or not, provide varying levels of grip or tackiness for gloved or gloveless hands and in wet or dry conditions. Textures can add tactility and grip, and for riders who tend to perspire or who ride in wet conditions, more texture usually can’t hurt. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding with the Fizik Tempo Bondcush 3mm Soft handlebar tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Bondcush-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Fizik’s Tempo Bondcush 3mm Soft handlebar tape adds a little girth to the bar, some nice cushioning, and has a soft, perforated surface that adds texture and has great grip in wet conditions or with sweaty hands.

These days, you can find handlebar tapes in thicknesses ranging from around 1.5mm up to roughly 5mm, with the vast majority of tapes falling between around 2mm and 3.5mm. Some tapes are even offered in several thicknesses, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F199807%2Flizard-skins-dsp-bar-tape-25-mm\">Lizard Skins DSP</a> which comes in 1.8mm, 2.5mm, 3.2mm, and 4.6mm, so you can choose which is best for your needs. What works best for you typically depends on the size of your hands, the type of riding you do, the surfaces you encounter, and how much (or little) cushioning you like. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Lizard Skins DSP Bar Tape wrapped on a handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lizard-Skins-DSP-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>The ever-popular Lizard Skins DSP bar tape comes in 4 thickness options so riders can choose what works best for their needs. We tested it in the 2.5mm thickness. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the thicker the tape, the more cushioning and vibration-dampening it provides. Most tapes have a cushioning layer of foam that is largely responsible for its thickness, and the more there is, the more it can absorb road buzz and vibration over rough surfaces. Of course, thickness isn’t the only determining factor, as the density of said foam also plays a role in its cushioning capabilities. And, given recent advancements in foam technology, modern bar tapes can provide enhanced cushioning without adding excessive thickness, thus offering riders nicely balanced levels of comfort and control with thinner tapes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1.jpeg\" alt=\"The Silca Nastro Cuscino bar tape wrapped on a handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Silca-Nastro-Cuscino-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>We loved the 2.5mm thickness of the Silca Nastro Cuscino tape tested for our average-sized hands and its balanced properties of grip, cushioning, and control. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tape thickness also impacts the effective diameter of the handlebar, making it adaptable for riders with different-sized hands. Riders with larger hands, for example, may prefer the feel and control provided by using a thicker tape that makes the handlebar fit more proportionally in their hands. Likewise, riders with smaller hands may find that a thinner tape helps them grip the handlebar and therefore control the front end of the bike a bit more easily. This mostly comes down to rider preference. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber.jpeg\" alt=\"Easton Microfiber tape wrapped on a handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Easton-Microfiber-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>The stretch of a handlebar tape, or lack thereof, impacts how easy it to wrap around tight bends and trickier areas like the hoods. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stretch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Handlebar tapes have varying levels of stretch depending mostly on the materials and construction. Tapes with more stretch are typically a bit more forgiving during the wrapping process and make it a bit easier to get around tight bends and the hoods whereas tapes with little to no stretch require a bit more care to wrap perfectly. Additionally, one can also alter the thickness and/or cushiness of a stretchy tape depending on how tightly you wrap it. The tighter you pull it, the thinner and less cushy it becomes, and vice versa.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision.jpeg\" alt=\"Close up view of the logo pattern of the HiFi Precision Premium handlebar tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HiFi-Precision-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Some handlebar tapes have cool patterns or logos that can lend a bit of flair to your cockpit.

Whether you’re looking for something subdued and classy or bright and flashy, there are options to suit virtually every taste and match any build. Some tapes come in only a few color options, while others come in a vast array of colors and/or patterns to choose from. While we wouldn’t necessarily recommend choosing a handlebar tape based solely on the color, you should be able to find something that meets both your performance needs and style too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding with the Supacaz Super Sticky Kush bar tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Supacaz-Sticky-Kush-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>While expensive, the Supacaz Super Sticky Kush tape adds a subtle pop of color in the drops and performs well enough that it’s one of our favorite all-around bar tapes. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Value</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bar tapes have increased significantly in cost recently, with most rolls costing over $30 and some upwards of $50. Tapes at the more expensive end of the spectrum, like the Supacaz, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-nastro-cuscino-bar-tape\">Silca Nastro Cuscino</a>, and Lizard Sins DSP, typically will provide low weight and bulk, supreme comfort, and hard-wearing durability. Mid-price point tapes can also provide all three of these but often lack in one of these areas. The least expensive tapes, like <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikinghandlebartape&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fcinelli-cork-tape\">Cinelli Cork Ribbon</a>, can perform well but may degrade faster, either by tearing, compressing, or losing stickiness due to surface erosion, but they are affordable to replace. Of course, regularly cleaning most tapes with mild soap and water will greatly extend their lifespan and usability. Depending on how much you ride, it’s reasonable to expect to get a full season, or possibly several, out of your handlebar tape, even with less expensive options. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Hand on the Fizik Tempo Bondcush Soft handlebar tape.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tempo-Bondcush-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Whatever handlebar tape you choose, a fresh wrap can have your bike looking and feeling like new.

There isn’t really any single handlebar tape that will be the perfect option for every single rider. Consider what you want from your handlebar tape and factors like material, thickness, cushioning, price, and even color, and you should be able to narrow down the options to find a good choice. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Can I use these handlebar tapes on my gravel bike?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Any of the handlebar tapes we tested can be used on gravel bikes, or any bike with a drop bar for that matter. Generally speaking, however, many gravel riders will opt for tapes that provide a good level of cushioning to take the edge off of the impacts and high-frequency vibrations experienced on gravel roads. Again, whether you’re riding pavement, gravel, or both, the right tape generally comes down to balancing your personal preferences for comfort and control.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Thick or thin handlebar tape, which is better?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Riders typically choose the thickness of their bar tape based on personal preference. As mentioned above, you can change the effective diameter of your handlebar with different thicknesses of bar tape to get a more proportional fit for the size of your hands. The feel of the bars is another factor that influences this choice as some riders want the super precise feel that a thinner tape can provide, while others may prefer the enhanced comfort that a thicker tape offers. We typically gravitate toward handlebar tapes that provide the best balance of control, grip, and cushioning, and these tend to be in the 2.5mm to 3mm thick range.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why are some of these handlebar tapes so expensive?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>With prices of the models we tested ranging from $20 to $50, bar tape is one of the least expensive things you can buy in cycling, but it’s fair to wonder what makes some tapes so much more expensive than others. The least expensive handlebar tapes, like the Cinelli Cork Ribbon, for example, have the simplest material and construction, so it stands to reason that a basic roll of cork/foam costs less. As materials and constructions get more advanced, however, the price goes up as well. Once you start bonding layers together and adding embossed, textured patterns and logos, it makes sense that some tapes are a bit more expensive. In our testing, we’ve also found that the more expensive options tend to provide the highest level of performance. These higher-end tapes also seem to be a bit more durable in our experience, making the price a little easier to justify. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>I’ve never replaced my own handlebar tape before, how do I do it?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Wrapping your handlebars is among the easier tasks in cycling, but if you’ve never done it before, it can be a little tricky. If you’re not the DIY type, that’s okay too, your local bike shop will be happy to take care of it for you. If you are willing to take it upon yourself, there are lots of helpful articles and videos online that explain it well and show you how it’s done. It would take a separate short article to explain how to do it properly, so we’ll skip the quick and dirty explanation here and hopefully bring you a “how-to” article in the near future.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I know when to replace my handlebar tape?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Like any consumable part on a bike, your handlebar tape will wear out eventually and needs to be replaced. The rate at which this happens varies depending on how much you ride, the conditions you ride in, and how well you maintain your tape. Fortunately, it’s fairly inexpensive compared to other bike parts, so keeping your bike’s handlebar looking and feeling fresh is relatively easy on the wallet. Over time, the foam can get compressed and the tape surface degrades from friction and sweat. A crash or even your bike tipping over can also cause premature damage to your handlebar tape. Signs that your handlebar tape has reached the end of its usable lifespan include rips, tears, abrasion, or the edges of the tape curling. If your cushy tape no longer feels cushy or you notice the texture of your tape is worn away or the grip is reduced, those are also indicators of worn-out tape. Some tapes may also get loose as they stretch out over time, a sure sign that it’s ready for fresh wrap. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I clean and maintain my handlebar tape?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>If you’ve ever ridden with white or lightly colored handlebar tape, then you know it gets dirty pretty quickly. Since it’s in constant contact with our hands, gloved or not, it takes a fair amount of abuse in the form of friction, sweat, dust, rain, and road spray. Taking a little time to clean your handlebar tape every once in a while can not only help keep it looking fresh but also help to extend its lifespan. Removing the buildup of sweat and road grime also makes it feel nicer on the hands. Most tapes, especially those with smooth or less porous surfaces, can be wiped clean fairly easily with mild soap and water and a towel.
