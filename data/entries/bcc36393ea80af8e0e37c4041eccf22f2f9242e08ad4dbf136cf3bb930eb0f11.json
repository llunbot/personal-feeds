{"title":"Jason Snell on US v. Apple","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/u-s-versus-apple-a-first-reaction/","date":1711048291000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors, with a first take I found myself nodding my head in agreement with throughout:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For me, the most unexpected part of the document was the DoJ’s \nexplanation that Apple’s success as a company largely stems from… \nthe DoJ itself. It points out that Apple’s resurgence early in \nthis century was due to the release of the iPod, which only became \na hit when it arrived on Windows. The DoJ argues that the iPod’s \npresence on Windows was only due to Microsoft being under a \nconsent decree from the DoJ for monopolistic behavior. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t know enough about the specifics of the Microsoft consent \ndecree to weigh in on the idea that an unconstrained Microsoft \nwould have made it impossible for Apple to make the iPod \ncompatible with Windows. It’s a pretty big hypothetical, and I’m \nskeptical, but I’m impressed that the DoJ would try to place its \ncurrent case within the larger DoJ Connected Universe. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t think you have to be a lawyer to argue that this is a nonsensical claim. Microsoft played all sorts of hardball with Windows’s licensing to PC makers back in the 1990s, but nothing they did would have ever stopped Apple from making iTunes for Windows and allowing iTunes for Windows to manage an iPod connected over USB. That’s one thing Windows (and DOS before it) always was: open to the third-party software. iTunes, to my recollection, was always software that users downloaded and installed themselves. iTunes was not pre-installed on PCs and thus subject to Microsoft’s licensing shenanigans (e.g. the way Microsoft used licensing discounts to discourage PC makers from shipping computers with Netscape pre-installed).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What strikes me most about this document is that people… <em>like</em> \nusing the iPhone? This suit (joined by 16 other attorneys general, \nmostly of blue states) has a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-lawsuit-against-apple-monopolizing\">political element to \nit</a>, \nin the sense of trying to send a message that your government is \nlooking out for your rights and protecting you from big, bad tech \ncompanies. </p>\n\n<p>What happens when that collides with a product that has extremely \nhigh customer satisfaction ratings? Those of us in the know are \nwell aware of all the ways that Apple plays hardball, and \nunderstand that the company is so powerful that really the only \nway it will be convinced to change its ways is under threat of \ngovernment intervention. But will American iPhone users feel like \nthe government is on their side, in taking on an American tech \ngiant that makes a product they actually enjoy using? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wonder very much about this too. The biggest US antitrust case in my lifetime was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System\">the breakup of Ma Bell</a>, a.k.a. AT&amp;T Classic. The “phone company” was universally reviled at the time, if only for the exorbitant long-distance phone call rates they charged. Ma Bell was both unpopular <em>and</em> inarguably a monopoly — the Bell system was the <em>only</em> way to place telephone calls.</p>\n\n<p>I think the public, by and large, was ambivalent about Microsoft’s monopoly abuse in the 1990s. But Apple is popular, the iPhone in particular. And many of the complaints lodged by the DOJ regarding the iPhone are the very things that make it popular.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/21/snell-us-vs-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bcc36393ea80af8e0e37c4041eccf22f2f9242e08ad4dbf136cf3bb930eb0f11","category":"Tech"}
