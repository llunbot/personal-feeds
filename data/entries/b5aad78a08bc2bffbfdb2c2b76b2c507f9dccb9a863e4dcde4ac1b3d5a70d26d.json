The presumed launch date has always been Google I/O, and that's <a href=\"https://io.google/2024/\">officially set</a> for May 14. Although the Pixel 8a recently <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/03/18/google-pixel-8a-fcc/\">hit the Federal Communications Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1750020625132085631\">the box</a> has leaked, and <a href=\"https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/google-pixel-8a-exclusive-first-look/\">renders</a> have been out since October, we haven't really talked specs.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1649570662292357120\">ever-reliable</a> Kamila Wojciechowska has a new article for <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8a-specs-exclusive-3426314/\">Android Authority</a> detailing some specs for the upcoming device. Apparently, there are some big upgrades planned. The Pixel 7a took a big jump to a 90 Hz display, and the Pixel 8a is encroaching even more into flagship territory with a 120 Hz display. Wojciechowska's source says the Pixel 8a display will be a 6.1-inch, 120 Hz, 2400Ã—1080 OLED panel with an improved 1,400 nits brightness. The display's 120 Hz screen will not only make the phone more competitive here; it will also be a big deal for the Pixel line's recent expansion into India, where 120 Hz is <a href=\"https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/best-phone-under-35000\">the norm</a> at this price range.</p>\n<p>The report says to expect the same camera loadout as the Pixel 7a, along with the newer Google Tensor G3 chip, just like the other Pixel 8 phones. Google doesn't mention it on the spec sheet, but Wojciechowska says internally there is a small difference: It's the same silicon on the A-series, but Google goes with a cheaper, hotter silicon packaging method. So expect some thermal differences.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011487#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011487&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b5aad78a08bc2bffbfdb2c2b76b2c507f9dccb9a863e4dcde4ac1b3d5a70d26d","category":"Tech"}
