Some people have observed strict social distancing, happily went into lockdown when case counts got high, and got a vaccine as soon as it became available. Others were nearly the opposite, protesting any public health measures and refusing the vaccine. And a whole lot of the population ended up somewhere between the two extremes.</p>\n<p>Obviously, for a complex response like that, multiple factors are probably in play, untangling them can be difficult. For example, conservatives in the US have received anti-vaccine messages from their political leaders, but that's coming on top of a long-term trend of mistrust toward scientific information.</p>\n<p>This week, however, a bit of data has come out that does a fairly good job of untangling those complications. One study indicates that skepticism toward scientific information appears to be linked to whether people followed lockdown instructions from health authorities. And a survey indicates that people are more likely to try untested \"cures\" for COVID-19 if they watch right-wing news sources.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804000#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804000&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aaf11e5d4d1fe75059e8a32ec20eae25593e2ee6d2ddd43fbb8901845829c04c","category":"Tech"}
