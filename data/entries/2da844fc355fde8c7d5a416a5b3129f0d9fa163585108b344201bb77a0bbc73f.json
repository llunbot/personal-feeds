We do not store or share this information.</blockquote>Based on this fine print, <em>MacRumors</em> discovered a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/connected-cards/\">legal document on Apple's website</a> explicitly mentioning that the Connected Cards feature will eventually be available to U.S. residents, with personal data to be processed by Apple Processing LLC:<blockquote>If you are in the United States, Connected Cards is provided by Apple Processing LLC; if you are in the United Kingdom, Connected Cards is provided by Apple Payment Services Ltd (together, \"Apple\").</blockquote>It's unclear when Connected Cards will launch in the U.S., or which banks will participate in the country. In the U.K., the feature relies on the country's open banking framework, but it's unclear how it would work stateside. Earlier this year, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it expected to <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/laying-the-foundation-for-open-banking-in-the-united-states/\">finalize an open banking rule in 2024</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple is working on expanding the new \"Connected Cards\" feature in iOS 17.1 to the US via \"Apple Processing LLC\"<br /><br />As found in the code: You permit Apple (Apple Payments Services Ltd (UK) or Apple Processing LLC (US)) to consolidate your account information and provide it to you. <a href=\"https://t.co/t8QxSWa3dL\">pic.twitter.com/t8QxSWa3dL</a></p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1707956080628687258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-wallet-connected-cards-feature-in-us/\">Apple Wallet's New Bank Account Feature Likely to Expand to U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wallets-new-bank-account-feature-likely-to-expand-to-u-s.2405603/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2da844fc355fde8c7d5a416a5b3129f0d9fa163585108b344201bb77a0bbc73f","category":"Apple"}
