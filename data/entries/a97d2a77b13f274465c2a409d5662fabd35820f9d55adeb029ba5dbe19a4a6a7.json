While there’s no branding to be seen on the jockey wheels, it seems likely these are from the brand, which we have approached for comment.</p>\n<p>Whoever makes the jockey wheels, Sagan is clearly convinced there’s an advantage to using them over stock Shimano options – perhaps the narrow-wide profile could improve chain retention over the rough cobbled sections that form part of the Belgium course? We’ll update this story once we get confirmation.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/Peter-Sagans-2021-road-cycling-world-champinonships-Specialized-Tarmac-SL7-10-67d2119.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Sagan has opted for Roval Rapide CLX wheels. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i></i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/Peter-Sagans-2021-road-cycling-world-champinonships-Specialized-Tarmac-SL7-11-ac76929.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>With 26mm wide Specialized Turbo Cotton tyres.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i></i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The bike is specced with a pair of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/roval-rapide-alpinist-clx-wheelset/\">Roval Rapide CLX</a> wheels and 26mm-wide Specialized Turbo Cotton clinchers.
