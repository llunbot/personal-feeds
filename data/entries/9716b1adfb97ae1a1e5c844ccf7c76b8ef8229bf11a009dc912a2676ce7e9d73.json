Locking items up, though, inconveniences shoppers because an employee has to be summoned to retrieve items for customers. CVS Health's chief technology officer Tilak Mandadi told <em>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> that people \"really, really dislike locked cabinets,\" which is why the chain is testing a new procedure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCVS shoppers who have the CVS app (with CVS account), activate Bluetooth, and connect to in-store Wi-Fi can unlock locked product cabinets with an ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCVS is testing the smartphone-based product unlocking in three of its retail locations, but it will soon be expanded to 10 to 15 stores. If the trial is successful, CVS plans to roll it out to all retail locations.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cvs/\">CVS</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/cvs-tests-smartphone-cabinet-unlocking/\">CVS Tests Letting iPhone Users Unlock Product Cabinets Without an Employee</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cvs-tests-letting-iphone-users-unlock-product-cabinets-without-an-employee.2448285/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9716b1adfb97ae1a1e5c844ccf7c76b8ef8229bf11a009dc912a2676ce7e9d73","category":"Apple"}
