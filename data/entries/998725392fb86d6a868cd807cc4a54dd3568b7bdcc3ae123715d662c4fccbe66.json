They keep a landline for emergencies because their only Internet service is satellite, and cellular service in the area is poor. Appel said they pay $41 a month for CenturyLink phone service.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink phone service became spotty and intermittent around January 20 when winter storms hit the area and then went out completely on January 27, Appel told us. She contacted Ars nearly two months after the outage began, desperate for a fix because her various chats with CenturyLink customer service led nowhere.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020483#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020483&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"998725392fb86d6a868cd807cc4a54dd3568b7bdcc3ae123715d662c4fccbe66","category":"Tech"}
