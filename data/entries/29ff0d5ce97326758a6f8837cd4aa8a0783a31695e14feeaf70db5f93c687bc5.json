The cases are across 29 states, but most are in or near Texas, where a massive outbreak continues to mushroom in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.</p>\n<p>On April 24, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tallied <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\">884 cases across the country</a>. Today, the Texas health department updated its outbreak total, <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025\">adding 22 cases</a> to its last count from Tuesday. That brings the national total to at least 906 confirmed cases. Most of the cases are in unvaccinated children and teens.</p>\n<p>Overall, Texas has identified 664 cases since late January. Of those, 64 patients have been hospitalized, and two unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying medical conditions have died of the disease.
