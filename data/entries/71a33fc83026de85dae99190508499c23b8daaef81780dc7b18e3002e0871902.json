And always following in the peloton’s wake were the cohorts of race photographers, jostling for position with rivals and braving extreme conditions to get the shots – the images that bring home the pain, the joy, the beauty and brutality of <em>La Corsa Rosa</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>British photographer Chris Auld is a veteran of Grand Tour photography and knows exactly what it’s like to blast around Italy for three weeks on the trail of the <em>maglia rosa</em>. For Auld, the Giro captures the essence of Grand Tour racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s a proper European cycling experience,’ he tells <em>Cyclist</em>. ‘It’s the most authentic Grand Tour to watch and it’s a lot more accessible than the Tour de France. Plus, it’s easier to get around and the roadsides aren’t busy with tourists. The majority of people watching the race are Italian. They’re so passionate about cycling. The locals make sure to come out in their thousands and wait by the roadside to cheer the riders for those milliseconds when they rush by.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Waiting for the prey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Photography is for the patient. There’s a lot of research, scouting and instinct that goes into framing a shot. This usually happens hours before the pros arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Some of my colleagues will plan everything ahead of time,’ Auld says. ‘But it doesn’t always work. Planning can come to nothing if you turn up and someone has erected a huge banner in the way of your carefully pre-planned shot. Races never consult photographers, so we have to be flexible. I prefer to wing it. I just like to drive the course, find a shot, get it, and only then figure out where to go next. We work in pairs – one of us drives, the other navigates.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grand Tours offer 21 days of material, but those photographers who aren’t following the race on an official moto only have a few chances to catch the riders along the route each day, and so resilience is a key asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘All too often we leave a stage disappointed for one reason or another – sometimes that’s our fault, sometimes it’s because things didn’t unfold as we wanted. We beat ourselves up over not getting the right shots, regretting those hours spent waiting on the roadside. You can’t let that get to your head, though. You have to dust yourself down and move on to the next stage.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Giro d’Italia 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>The ride that goes wrong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giro does a good line in chaos. Despite all the careful organisation, the nature of Grand Tour racing means something is bound to go wrong at some point, especially when the Giro heads towards the northern Italian peaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 16 of the 2024 edition renewed the yearly administrative standoff in the face of extreme Alpine weather. This came as no shock to the photographers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Every year the race organisers decide to go over the highest mountain and it all goes pear-shaped. When this happens, you’ve got no information whatsoever, and the organisation is very economical with what they tell you,’ says Auld. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We didn’t even shoot the start of the stage because of the torrential rain. We were sat in a cafe waiting for information to come through. Some colleagues up the road told us that the Stelvio had been closed. Then we got a message to say the riders would go over the Mortirolo instead. This couldn’t happen because it was shut for roadworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We spent the whole day driving about and all we got was Pogačar’s finishing line shot. Twelve hours of work for one shot.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Capturing the boy prince</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Through snow, rain and sunshine, photographers played a crucial role in memorialising Tadej Pogačar’s unstoppable Giro. Along the way, the UAE Team Emirates leader clinched six stage wins, the mountains classification and the overall crown. A more dominant Grand Tour performance you’re unlikely to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Auld envies the Slovenian’s ease: ‘You rarely see a pain face from Pogačar,’ he says. ‘Even when he’s digging deep, it’s not written all over his face, which is a shame as we like to see a bit of pain. But he’s great at showboating at the finish. That’s gold for us. It’s deflating when riders just stop their bike computer as they cross the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Looking back at the pictures, you truly realise his dominance. When it was happening in front of me on the road, I didn’t feel as though I was capturing cycling history. But I reckon when I look back in time, I will.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Picture in pink: Giro d’Italia 2024 gallery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Main image: ‘We were driving along the Ligurian coast ahead of the peloton on Stage 5, and I could see an elevated road to our right. I knew there was a good shot to be had up there. Photographers like me don’t have helicopters, so this was a rare chance to get up above the race and capture the peloton with a wide view of the town and sea in the background.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Giro d'Italia 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/giro-2024-photography-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘At the final presentation one of my photographer colleagues asked Pogačar to kiss the trophy,’ says Giro photographer Chris Auld. ‘“I’m not doing that.” he said.
