Left or right? Left or right? The question circles my mind like a roulette ball as I race down the descent towards a fork in the road. Which option will my mental ball land on? There’s no prize, only the difference in distance that I will have remaining before I get to the finish line. Going left leaves me with 90km, right with 155km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sane choice seems obvious, especially given that I’ve already amassed 145km, not to mention the fact that the string of riders ahead of me are all heading left. Yet as I reach the junction moments later, something inside compels me to turn right, reasoning that I’ve already gambled once today, so I may as well go all-in now for the full route of Croatia’s premier sportive, the Istria 300.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hardknott-pass\">Why the Hardknott Pass is the hardest climb in England</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/asturias-spain-cycling\">A grande day out: Asturias, Spain Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/slaying-the-beast-sveti-jure-big-ride\">Slaying the Beast: Croatia Big Ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The first gamble was my bike choice.

The first part of the sportive is neutralised as we roll slowly through the old town, but as soon as the race organiser’s car pulls to one side there’s a cacophony of gear changes and a group of riders shoots past me in a blur of carbon and brightly coloured Lycra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to worry; I tell myself that these are obviously the elite riders duking it out for overall victory, an argument bolstered by the fact former Paris-Roubaix winner Sonny Colbrelli and his Bahrain Victorious teammate Fran Miholjević are among their ranks.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"609\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-04-970x609.jpg\" alt=\"Istria 300 sportive review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-04-970x609.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-04-300x188.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-04-768x482.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-04-750x471.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-04-1140x715.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A minute later and another wave of riders comes past me. Suddenly my choice of bike doesn’t seem so cunning. I’m painfully aware that I’m already putting out more watts than I’d like at this early stage in proceedings, and I’m still being dropped like a bad smell. The tail rider of the group bids me good luck before heading up the road and out of sight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the frantic start the pace eventually settles, mercifully allowing me to attach myself to the back of a small pack spearheaded by four efficient-looking Austrians intent on tapping out a steady rhythm. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Istria 300 sportive review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>With the Rasa Gulf in the background, the riders head towards Brovinje at the most southern tip of the route.</figcaption><figcaption>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The opening 30km rises gradually upwards past little villages yet to shake off the chill dawn air, the road picking its way through immaculately tended vineyards and olive groves packed with gnarled trees. In cafes, a few locals sit drinking their early-morning espressos, almost all of them puffing on cigarettes, the smoke lingering in the air as we glide past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon the road drops away on a fast, sweeping descent around a series of lazy switchbacks, revealing a swathe of green as we head away from the coast and into the forested interior. The sun peeks over the horizon and brings a welcome warmth to the morning, which also serves to make sweat appear on my brow as we hit yet another short climb. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Istria 300 sportive review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>From the most southerly tip of the route, the road heads north and descends to Ravni with the Rijeka Gulf as the backdrop.</figcaption><figcaption>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to imagine that a route whose highest point is only 460m above sea level can contain so much climbing, but I’m beginning to understand that there will be no killer blow on today’s ride. It will be death by a thousand cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Of dragons and pigs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our hitherto organised little group quickly splinters as gradients reach double digits, each of us grinding to the top at our own pace, quickly forgetting the camaraderie that saw us through the previous kilometres.

When the road finally emerges through the foliage it does so in dramatic fashion, opening out onto views across the Adriatic Sea, sunlight sparkling off its surface.

It’s here I take my second gamble. In going for the full route I cut away the safety net of riding in a group; it’s now me and the lonely road ahead. A series of calculations runs through my head, all aimed at answering one question. Will I make the time cut?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For long periods I never doubt it, my average speed still on the right side of 25kmh. What those calculations fail to include is the nature of the road ahead, one that very quickly turns from benign to sadistic. It was foolish of me to think that the additional 2,000m of ascent contained in the full route would come easily. The climbing that came earlier in the day pales against the inclines that I now face, the road rising sharply in a series of unrelenting ramps.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Istria 300 sportive review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-11.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Passing through the village of Livade before the final climb up to Oprtalj.</figcaption><figcaption>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Recent rains have done little to help the quality of minor country lanes that are littered with debris and dirt. Now I am genuinely thankful for being on a gravel bike, especially when I sail past two riders pushing their bikes through a particularly treacherous section of rutted road buried under a thick layer of mud. They quickly catch back up and the three of us form a trio for a short time: a Welshman, a Portuguese and a German. It should be the setup for a politically incorrect joke, but there’s not much smiling going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead it’s another climb, another energy-sapping effort to zigzag up steep gradients. The old, fortified town of Motovun comes into view, its whitewashed buildings perched atop a hill, and I know that once we’re past it the subsequent descent will bring us to the foot of the final big climb of the day.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Istria 300 sportive review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12-750x1124.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-12.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The route snakes under the main road near Dolenja Vas on the northeastern tip of the route.</figcaption><figcaption>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s a climb I rode earlier in the week to test it out, and I remember thinking that it wasn’t too bad – a steady 5km effort – but now, with 235km in my legs, I’m dreading it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haul myself upwards from the valley floor through a forest famed for its truffles, the delicacy that forms a part of the pasta feed station at the top of the climb.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"655\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13-655x970.jpg\" alt=\"Istria 300 sportive review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13-655x970.jpg 655w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13-202x300.jpg 202w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13-768x1138.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13-1037x1536.jpg 1037w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13-750x1111.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13-1140x1689.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-13.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Grinding to the top of one of the day’s hardest climbs above Lake Butoniga.</figcaption><figcaption>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sadly there’s no such luxury for me, as my latest calculations put me behind the time cut, a fact confirmed by the ominous arrival of the broom wagon. I’m given the choice of getting in but I’m not prepared to accept defeat so easily. I grab a handful of gels from a table and set off in search of the finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Racing the darkness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s now not only a race to beat the time cut, but the impending darkness. When I started the ride – 11 and a half hours ago – I hadn’t ever imagined still being on the course so late in the day and had set off without lights, another little gamble that’s now coming back to haunt me. Eventually I accept I’m not going to make up the time and won’t make it before the 12-hour time cut.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Istria 300 sportive review\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/sportive-143-istria-14.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The sun is about to set on both the day and our hopes of making it home before the time cut.</figcaption><figcaption>Gavin Kaps/Osprey Imagery</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On one hand I’m disappointed after exerting so much effort; on the other I’m relieved I can back off the pace and enjoy the final kilometres of a route that has left me both cursing at its savagery and in awe of its beauty.

There are direct flights from the UK with the major airlines, although some (Ryanair) don’t fly there in October, and others (British Airways) don’t go direct once the summer season ends. Easyjet still flies direct during October. From the airport, it’s a 45-minute drive to Poreč, or around 2.5 hours by public transport.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Istria 300 is partnered with hotel chain Valamar (<a href=\"https://www.valamar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">valamar.com</a>), which offers discounts for entrants to the event. Valamar has a number of hotels, resorts and campsites in the region, and its Diamant Hotel &amp; Residence (where we stayed – very nice it was too) has bike storage and servicing facilities, is a ten-minute walk to the centre of Poreč, and will provide an early breakfast on the day of the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 143 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/istria-300-sportive-croatia-cycling\">The rest is Istria: Riding the Istria 300, Croatia’s biggest sportive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3841cf40fd417c3b9d38374586ac7994ce0d9c5e328bee089517d25127baca1a","category":"Cycling"}
