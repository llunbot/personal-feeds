We’re in the home stretch now, however, and we’ve got a pretty robust launch on the way. Our webshop is still technically down, although our existing product is live on <a href=\"https://www.theproscloset.com/collections/radavist\" target=\"_blank\">The Pro’s Closet</a>, and our portal will be redesigned this week. We’ve got shirts, bottles, stem caps, and more on the way. We’re hoping it’ll be live the first week of December and we’ll be sure to get your order out ASAP since all of our goods are being fulfilled in Colorado by The Pro’s Closet’s staff.</p>\n<p>Keep your eyes peeled here for an announcement shortly!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/11/a-sneak-peek-at-our-winter-drop/\">A Sneak Peek At Our Winter Drop</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"8a645ab4d7d8af76ef3f9eec148394b9eb5f0e74e8448b79f88f4f15279d397f","category":"Cycling"}
