And gearboxes have definitely been a trend for decades. I remember Greg Minnaar racing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_RN-01_G-cross\" target=\"_blank\">Honda RN-01</a> years before Bikerumor even started geeking out on bikes. But more recent refinement of Pinion’s gearboxes and Gates’ centerline belts have boosted gravity bike development, giving design engineers the freedom to better tune weight distribution &amp; suspension performance, not to mention eliminating vulnerable derailleurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2025, Gates has officially partnered with four elite DH race teams – Aon racing Gamux bikes, Atherton Racing on their own prototype frames, Intense Factory Racing also on their own prototypes, and MS-Racing now on the Zerode below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the biggest crop yet of teams at the elite level racing gearbox &amp; belt-drive transmissions, and thus the best chance a rider for one of these teams to grab that bonus €100k prize from Gates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 4 gearbox bikes of the 2025 UCI DH World Cup</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><em>Gamux Sego</em></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023-edited.webp\" alt=\"gamux sego gearbox belt drive prototype dh bike raced fort william bds 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023-edited.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023-edited-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023-edited-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023-edited-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023-edited-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gamux-sego-gearbox-belt-driven-downhill-bike-cnc-machined-raced-at-fort-william-british-downhill-series-2023-edited-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo Jessie-May Morgan/Bikerumor)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we caught up with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/think-you-can-win-a-dh-world-cup-gatesll-give-you-e100k-if-you-do-it-with-a-belt-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">Gates-backed prize purse</a> last spring when it was pretty much only the CNC-machined alloy <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gamux-sego-gearbox-dh-prototype-belt-driven/\" target=\"_blank\">Gamux Sego</a> with bonded-in carbon infill (<em>above</em>) that we saw on the elite DH circuit. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><em>Atherton A.200.G</em></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_YouTube-story_complete-bike.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_YouTube-story_complete-bike.webp\" alt=\"Atherton A.200.G prototype gearbox DH bike, YouTube story update, complete bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_YouTube-story_complete-bike.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_YouTube-story_complete-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_YouTube-story_complete-bike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_YouTube-story_complete-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atherton-Bike-A-200-G-DH-prototype-3D-printed-titanium-and-carbon-gearbox-downhill-mountain-bike_YouTube-story_complete-bike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Atherton Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But since then, we’ve also seen a teaser of Atherton’s new carbon &amp; 3D-printed titanium <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/atherton-bike-a200g-prototype-3d-printed-gearbox-dh-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">A.200.G prototype</a> gearbox bike.

There’s also some conventional old school internal cable routing to get things out of the way simply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most likely, we’d expect the MS Racing team to kit their Zerode G3 out with the latest Smart.Shift gearbox. There seems to be a lot of interest from the top DH teams on its ability to shift instantly and effortlessly in all conditions, and it’s a premium option on Zerode’s commercial models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zerode G3 – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail.webp\" alt=\"Zerode G3 200mm alloy DH gearbox, belt-drive downhill bike, Pinion SmartShift\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Zerode-G3-DH_production-200mm-aluminum-mullet-gearbox-downhill-race-mountain-bike_Pinion-SmartShift-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zerode G3 is probably the most available gearbox DH bike out there at the moment, with 3 standard sizes and 3 finishes on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Origin frameset with frame, shock &amp; full drivetrain sells for NZ$6000 (plus tax where applicable) / 4950€.
