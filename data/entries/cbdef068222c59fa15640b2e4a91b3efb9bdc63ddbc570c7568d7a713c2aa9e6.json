In our Mac buying guide, you’ll find everything you need to know about the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, iMac, Mac Pro and Mac Studio, with expert buying advice to help you choose the machine (and configuration) that’s right for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple makes six different types of Mac: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, iMac, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, but within each of those categories there are variations in the size, specs and features, so things can get pretty complicated. That’s where this guide comes in, helping you make the right decision.

The transition began with the introduction of the M1 in November 2020, followed by the M1 Pro, M1 Max and M1 Ultra, then the M2 in June 2022, the M2 Pro and M2 Max in January 2023, the M2 Ultra in June 2023 and the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max in October 2023. Since June 2023 every Mac Apple sells uses Apple’s own chips rather than Intel processors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are yet to upgrade your Intel Mac to one powered by Apple’s silicon it is time to do so. If you are concerned that a must-have app doesn’t run on an M-series Mac, consider finding a new app because the performance gains are tremendous. For example, in our tests we found that the M3 iMac is faster than the fastest iMac Pro with an 18-core Intel Xeon processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information see our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670873/which-mac-processor-apple-processor-comparison-m1-vs-intel.html\">Mac processor comparison where we compare M1, M2 &amp; M3 vs Intel</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Every Mac Apple sells</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below we’ll take you through each Mac that is currently available from Apple, to give you an overview of what’s on offer and what you’ve got to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13-inch MacBook Air, M2 (13.6-inch 2022) &amp; M1 (13.3-inch 2020) \t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1246\" height=\"868\" alt=\"13-inch MacBook Air, M2 (13.6-inch 2022) &amp; M1 (13.3-inch 2020) \" src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4350835_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,099 (WAS $1,199)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FUS1661174.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-219909-6-782218-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$887.4 at  Adorama</a><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6509644/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-782218-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$949 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-MacBook-Air-M2-chip-13-6-inch-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Midnight/1804436227&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-782218-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1049 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The MacBook Air is Apple’s most affordable laptop, designed with portability in mind. There are currently three versions of the MacBook Air available from Apple: an 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 chip, a 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip, and a 15-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip. We will start with the 13-inch models and discuss the 15-inch MacBook Air below. </p>\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air was introduced in July 2022 with a brand new look and a 13.6-inch screen. There is also a slightly smaller 13.3-inch MacBook Air with M1 which launched back in November 2020 and Apple still sells (for now). The newer MacBook Air is only $100/$100 more than the M1 model and is well worth the upgrade. For more information about how these two models compare read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/784743/m2-macbook-air-vs-m1-design-performance-price.html\">MacBook Air M2 vs M1</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The MacBook Air is ideal for the budget-conscious. It’s also for anyone who is always on the go, doesn’t want to be bogged down by a regular-size laptop, and needs a computer that’s more versatile than an iPad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the MacBook Air cost? </strong>Prices start at $999/£999 for the MacBook Air M1 and $1,099/£1,149 for the MacBook Air M2 (which had a price drop from $1,199/£1,249). </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The M1 MacBook Air has one fewer GPU core and supports less Unified Memory (RAM) than the M2 model, which can support 8GB, 16GB or 24GB Unified Memory. We recommend that you get as much RAM as you can afford as a build-to-order option when you purchase the Mac as we don’t think 8GB is really sufficient. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M1 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 256GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, $999/£999</li>\n\n<li>Apple M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 256GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, $1,099/£1,149 </li>\n\n<li>Apple M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, $1,399/£1,449</li>\n\n<li>Additional options for M2 model: 16GB or 24GB unified memory.

The M1 MacBook Air only offers two Thunderbolt/USB 4 connectors, so one of these will have to be utilized for charging. If you want to connect USB-A devices, you need either a USB-C to USB adapter, like Apple’s <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-219909-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\">$19</a> / <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-219909-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ1M2ZM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">£19</a> one, or a USB-C hub that has USB-A ports. See our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668462/best-usb-c-hubs-and-adapters-for-mac-2022.html\">best USB-C hubs and adapters</a>. If you want to plug in more than one external display officially you can’t – but we know a workaround, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">How to connect two or more external displays to an M1, M2 or M3 MacBook</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The MacBook Air has built-in Wi-Fi for connecting to a network. It also provides built-in Bluetooth for wirelessly connecting a mouse or other peripherals. If you want to connect to an ethernet network, you need an adapter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> The M2 provides performance that is leaps and bounds faster than the Intel processors that were previously found in the MacBook Air, and Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/243654/gl30-instant-digital-camera.html\">claims</a> an 18 percent total CPU improvement over the M1, and a 35 percent improvement in graphics speed. It’s plenty fast enough for general purpose use. But because it doesn’t have a fan to keep the computer cool, it may throttle down its speed during long processing sessions, such as video editing or compiling code, for which the MacBook Pro with it’s fan is a better choice. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The MacBook Air is a great affordable laptop for someone who does general-purpose work and moves around a lot, such as a student or a self-employed person. You can’t easily upgrade the storage or memory after purchase, so you should buy the model with the largest amount of storage you can afford. We do advise that if you can afford to you should <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1483183/ssd-speeds-m2-macbook-pro-mac-mini.html\">avoid the entry-level models due to slower SSDs</a>, but that may not be an issue if the kind of work you do doesn’t require a lot of writing to the hard drive. </p>\n\n<p>Our only suggestion right now would be to wait, if you can, for Apple to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 version of the MacBook Air</a>, which we expect will happen in spring 2024. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 13-inch MacBook Air (M2, 2022) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 15-inch MacBook Air (M2, 2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" alt=\"Apple 15-inch MacBook Air (M2, 2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Apple-MacBook-Air-15in-02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $1,299\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6534603/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-1944104-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1049 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7686169?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$1,049.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmqkr3.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-219909-6-1944104-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1244 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The 15-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip joined the range about a year after Apple launched the 13-inch MacBook Air. If features the same processor, but gains a bigger screen and a six-speaker system vs four speakers. Surprisingly, battery life isn’t better on the 15-inch, despite the bigger battery.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The 15-inch MacBook Air is ideal for anyone who wants a big-screen laptop without having to spend a fortune. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models cost considerably more than the 15-inch MacBook Air does, although not quite as much as was the case before Apple introduced the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro in place of the 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro. It’s a great choice for anyone who is always on the go due to its lightweight design.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the MacBook Air cost? </strong>There are two standard configurations starting at $1,299/£1,399. You can pay another $200/£200 for twice as much storage. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The specifications of the M2 Macs are the same (although there are some differences in terms of audio, with the larger model featuring more speakers and obviously a larger screen).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 256GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, $1,299/£1,399.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, $1,499/£1,599.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options for M2 model: 16GB or 24GB unified memory.

Our recommendation is to up the amount of RAM (Unified Memory) when you buy it as you can’t update it later and we think 8GB isn’t really enough. If you can afford to you should also avoid the 256GB SSD model because that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1483183/ssd-speeds-m2-macbook-pro-mac-mini.html\">SSD is known to be slower</a>, but that may not be an issue if the kind of work you do doesn’t involve writing to the drive often. If you took that advice the MacBook Air would cost $1,699/£1,799, which is $100/£100 more than the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro which comes with the same 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 512GB SSD. The 16GB Unified Memory update would add another $200/£200 to that price.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1945548/15-inch-macbook-air-vs-14-inch-pro-design-specs-price.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 15-inch MacBook Air (M2, 2023) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M3, late 2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" alt=\"Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M3, late 2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Macbook-Pro-14-M3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6534640/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-2121023-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1449 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5JV268?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$1,449.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Pro-14-in-M3-chip-8C-CPU-10C-GPU-512GB-8GB-Silver-Fall-2023-MR7J3LL-A/5131587496&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-2121023-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1509 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> In October 2023 Apple discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro and replaced it in the lineup with an M3 version of the 14-inch MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro isn’t just bigger than the one it replaced, the 14-inch MacBook’s HDR ProMotion display is significantly better than the 13-inch model’s. It also offers twice the storage, HDMI, SDXC slot, better battery life, and a newer design. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip is for a more demanding user than the MacBook Air. Its main benefit is the design allows for better cooling, which means that if you push the machine it won’t slow down to avoid overheating. However, there are other MacBook Pro available from Apple (including a 16-inch model) that offer faster processors, so if you really need a powerful machine one of those might be more suitable–we’ll discuss the M3 Pro and M3 Max models below. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 14-inch MacBook Pro cost?</strong> The entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,599/£1,699. There’s another model available with twice the storage (1TB) for $200/£200 more. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M3 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, SDXDC, HDMI, $1,599/£1,699.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 1TB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, SDXDC, HDMI, $1,799/£1,899.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options for M3 model: 16GB or 24GB unified memory. Up to 2TB storage</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are display specifications?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a native resolution of 3,024×1,964 and 1,000 nits brighness, 1600 nits peak, 600 nits SDR brightness,and ProMotion for adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz. </li>\n\n<li>The notch at the top of the display conceals the FaceTime 1080p camera. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless connectivity. The late-2023 models offer Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.3, which is an improvement on the predecessor. </p>\n\n<p>The choice of ports is also an improvement on the predecessor: Apple includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports that are compatible with USB-C (if you have wired devices that aren’t USB-C or are an older version of Thunderbolt, you’ll need an adapter, we have a separate <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229045/thunderbolt-3-adapter-m1-imac-macbook-pro-mac-mini-usb-displayport-hdmi-ethernet.html\">MacBook Pro Thunderbolt adapter guide</a> to help you decide which ones you’ll need). The 14-inch MacBook Pro also come with an HDMI port for connecting an external display or projector, and an SDXC Card slot for plugging in memory cards from cameras, audio recorders, and other devices. The HDMI port also supports multichannel audio output. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The M3 version of the 14-inch MacBook Pro will currently outperform the MacBook Air, but once the MacBook Air gains the M3 chip expect the performance gap to close. However, as we said above, even with the same chip you can expect more out of the MacBook Pro just because it features a fan for cooling (the MacBook Air doesn’t have the space for this). If you need a really powerful Mac then you should look to the M3 Pro or even the M3 Max.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The bad news is that although the 14-inch MacBook Pro now starts at the lower price of $1,599/£1,699 (versus $1,999/£2,149 for the M2 Pro model), is quite a bit higher than the $1,299/£1,349 price that the 13-inch MacBook Pro sold for. </p>\n\n<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro Apple used to sell was almost identically specced to the MacBook Air, and for a very similar price. But now the 14-inch MacBook Pro starts $500/£550 more than the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air, which is a huge leap. Although, as we explained above, if you spec the MacBook Air to better match the MacBook Pro–increasing the RAM being our top tip– the gap isn’t as wide.  </p>\n\n<p>The MacBook Pro now has a better screen, better battery life, and other benefits. It is also a chip generation ahead of the MacBook Air, but that is unlikely to be the case for long. So if budget is what is important to you, save your money and buy a MacBook Air–but wait until the M3 model arrives. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14-inch MacBook Pro, M3 Pro &amp; M3 Max (late 2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" alt=\"14-inch MacBook Pro, M3 Pro &amp; M3 Max (late 2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Macbook-Pro-14-M3_2273.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5LN355?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$1,799.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6534616/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-2121030-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1849 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmrx63ll.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-219909-6-2121030-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1999 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro or Ms Max was introduced in October 2023 (less than a year after the M2 Pro and M2 Max models arrived in January 2023). This is one of Apple’s top-of-the-line laptops, the other being the 16-inch MacBook Pro. There’s not a huge difference between the specs on offer–both offer the M3 Max as a processor option–but the 14-inch MacBook Pro is cheaper than the 16-inch. If you want a laptop that can handle any task you throw at it—and you don’t have a constraining budget—you want one of these laptops.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> When Apple called these “Pro” laptops, they weren’t kidding around. If your work is very demanding processing power, these laptops are happy to handle it. Work in pro-level software all the time? Get a 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro. With either the M3 Pro or M3 Max processor, they’re the fastest laptops Apple has ever created.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 14-inch MacBook Pro cost? </strong>There are three configurations starting at $1,999/£2,099 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 Pro with 11-core CPU, 14-core GPU, 18GB unified memory and 512GB SSD, and $2,399/£2,499 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU, 18GB unified memory and 1TB SSD. The third option is the M3 Max version with 14-core CPU, 30-core GPU, 36GB memory and 1TB SSD, that costs $3,199/£3,299. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> Here are the standard configurations for the 14-inch MacBook Pro</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M3 Pro SoC with 18GB of memory, a 11-core CPU, 14-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, 70W power adapter</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 Pro SoC with 18GB of memory, a 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 1TB SSD, 96W power adapter</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 Max SoC with 36GB of memory, a 14-core CPU, 30-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 1TB SSD, 96W power adapter</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: M3 Max SoC with 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 36GB, 48GB, 96GB or 128GB unified memory. Up to 8TB SSD. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compared to the M2 Pro and M2 Max models these newer Macs have more memory as standard (18GB vs 16GB, 36GB vs 32GB), but one fewer GPU core. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are display specifications?</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display hasn’t changed from its native resolution of 3,024×1,964, 254 pixels per inch, 1,600 nits of maximum brightness and 1,000 nits for HDR content, but it now offers 600 nits for standard content, up from 500. You’ll also get 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio, and ProMotion support with a refresh rate up to 120Hz.</li>\n\n<li>The notch at the top of the display conceals the FaceTime 1080p camera, which is an improvement over the 720p camera in the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and previous MacBook Pros. The notch does not affect the available screen area—the work area is a 16-by-10 space, while the screen surrounding the notch is considered extra space and is used to display the menu bar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> The 14-inch MacBook Pro has Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connectivity. </p>\n\n<p>As for its ports, Apple includes three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports that are compatible with USB-C. If you have a Thunderbolt device, you can plug it directly into the laptop. The same goes for any USB-C device. However, if you have wired devices that aren’t USB-C or are an older version of Thunderbolt, you’ll need an adapter. We have a separate  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229045/thunderbolt-3-adapter-m1-imac-macbook-pro-mac-mini-usb-displayport-hdmi-ethernet.html\">MacBook Pro Thunderbolt adapter guide</a> to help you decide which ones you’ll need. </p>\n\n<p>These laptops also come with an HDMI port for connecting an external display or projector, and an SDXC Card slot for plugging in memory cards from cameras, audio recorders, and other devices. The HDMI port in the 2023 model supports multichannel audio output. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I charge the laptop?</strong> Apple has equipped the 14-inch and 16-inch laptops with MagSafe, a magnetic connector that breaks away with a good tug. It’s a nice safety feature, but you can also charge using the Thunderbolt port, too. </p>\n\n<p>The fast charging feature allows the laptop to go from no charge to 50 percent in 30 minutes, but you need to have the proper power adapter to do this. It won’t work with the 70W adapter that comes with the $1,999 MacBook Pro. The 14-inch models need to use the 96W adapter (which is a $20/£10 upgrade) and can do fast charging through MagSafe or a Thunderbolt port.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> Apple built the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with pro users in mind and it shows in the performance. Now that Apple has introduced the M3 Pro and M3 Max you can enjoy the fastest Mac laptops Apple has ever made, in fact the M3 Pro chips have been the M2 Max chips in our geekbench tests, although when it comes to graphics prowess the Max will always beat the Pro.  So if you need the fastest then you’ll want to upgrade to the M3 Max. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The only reason not to buy the 14-inch M3 Pro or M3 Max MacBook Pro would be if you saw a good deal on the M2 Pro/M2 Max version–we’ve been seeing some <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">excellent deals and price cuts</a> on the older models. Our other advice would be that if you are considering the 14-inch MacBook Pro because you need a powerful Mac then, ignore the $1,999/£2,099 model in favor of the $2,399/£2,499 model which has more CPU and GPU cores. If you don’t need 1TB storage, save money by adding the M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU as a build-to-order option to the $1,999/£2,099 model for an additional $200/£200, bringing the price to $2,199/£2,299. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t16-inch MacBook Pro, M2 Pro &amp; M2 Max (2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" alt=\"16-inch MacBook Pro, M2 Pro &amp; M2 Max (2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-left-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$2,499\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6534619/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-2121048-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$2299 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5KXTND?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$2,299.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Pro-16-in-M3-Pro-chip-12C-CPU-18C-GPU-512GB-18GB-Silver-Fall-2023-MRW43LL-A/5164866893&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-2121048-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$2344 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The 16-inch MacBook Pro, like the 14-inch model above, was updated in October 2023. It offers a similar set of specs and configuration options as the 14-inch MacBook Pro (above), but it has a higher price, a bigger screen and better battery life. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> This is Apple’s largest “Pro” laptop and it’s designed for people who need a portable Mac to do work that demands extreme processing power. You could save some money by opting for the 14-inch MacBook Pro, but if you need a big screen on your laptop this is the Mac for you. You’ll also benefit from longer battery life. Configured with the M3 Max this is the fastest and most powerful laptop Apple has ever created. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the 16-inch MacBook Pro cost? </strong>There are four standard configurations starting at $2,499/£2,599 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Pro with 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU and 18GB RAM, 512GB SSD; $2,899/£2,999 for the MacBook Pro M3 Pro with 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU, 36GB RAM, and 512TB SSD; $3,499/£3,599 for the MacBook Pro M3 Max with 14-core CPU, 38-core GPU, 36GB RAM, and 1TB SSD; and  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> Here are the standard configurations for the 16-inch MacBook Pro introduced in 2023.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M3 Pro SoC with 12-core CPU, a 18-core GPU, 18GB Unified Memory, 512GB SSD, 140W power adapter, $2,499/£2,599.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 Pro SoC with 12-core CPU, a 18-core GPU, 36GB Unified Memory, 512GB SSD, 140W power adapter, $2,899/£2,999.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 Max SoC with 14-core CPU, 30-core GPU, 36GB Unified Memory, 1TB SSD, 140W power adapter,  $3,499/£3,599.</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 Max SoC with 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB Unified Memory, 1TB SSD, 140W power adapter,  $3,999/£4,099.</li>\n\n<li>Additional options:  48GB, 64GB, 94GB or 128GB unified memory. Up to 8TB SSD. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are display specifications?</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a native resolution of 3,456×2,234, 1,600 nits of maximum brightness and 1,000 nits for HDR content, but it now offers 600 nits for standard content, up from 500. You’ll also get 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio, and ProMotion support with a refresh rate up to 120Hz.</li>\n\n<li>The notch at the top of the display conceals the FaceTime 1080p camera, which is an improvement over the 720p camera in the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and previous MacBook Pros. The notch does not affect the available screen area—the work area is a 16-by-10 space, while the screen surrounding the notch is considered extra space and is used to display the menu bar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> The 16-inch MacBook Pro has Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connectivity. </p>\n\n<p>As for its ports, Apple includes three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports that are compatible with USB-C. If you have a Thunderbolt device, you can plug it directly into the laptop. The same goes for any USB-C device. However, if you have wired devices that aren’t USB-C or are an older version of Thunderbolt, you’ll need an adapter. We have a separate \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229045/thunderbolt-3-adapter-m1-imac-macbook-pro-mac-mini-usb-displayport-hdmi-ethernet.html\">MacBook Pro Thunderbolt adapter guide</a> to help you decide which ones you’ll need. Unfortunately, be prepared to shell out a good amount of extra cash.</p>\n\n<p>These laptops also come with an HDMI 2.0 port for connecting an external display or projector, and an SDXC Card slot for plugging in memory cards from cameras, audio recorders, and other devices. The HDMI port supports multichannel audio output. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I charge the laptop?</strong> Apple has equipped the 14-inch and 16-inch laptops with MagSafe, a magnetic connector that breaks away with a good tug. It’s a nice safety feature, but you can also charge using the Thunderbolt port, too. </p>\n\n<p>The fast charging feature allows the laptop to go from no charge to 50 percent in 30 minutes, but you need to have the proper power adapter to do this. Fast charging does not work through Thunderbolt or with an adapter with lower wattage, so you’ll need the 140W power adapter that is included in the box for this. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> The 16-inch MacBook Pro models were built with pro users in mind so you can expect excellent performance. Your software will be able to take full advantage of the CPU’s multiple cores. If you are a professional, you’ll benefit from the M3 Pro or M3 Max. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The M3 Pro and Max launched in October 2023, so don’t expect an update until the end of 2024, maybe early 2025. As above, look out for deals on the M2 Pro and M2 Max models: we’ve seen some <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">excellent deals and price cuts</a> on these models which while not as powerful are still excellent machines. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMac mini, M2 &amp; M2 Pro (2023) \t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Mac mini, M2 &amp; M2 Pro (2023) \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apple-mac-mini-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6427500/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-1475644-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$499 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHGHGXR?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$499.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-2023-Mac-Mini-Desktop-Computer-M2-chip-8-core-CPU-10-core-GPU-8GB-Unified-Memory-256GB-SSD-Storage-Gigabit-Ethernet-Works-iPhone-iPad/2808789687&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-1475644-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$584 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The Mac mini with M2 and a Mac mini with M2 Pro were introduced in January 2023. This is Apple’s smallest desktop Mac and offers a nice combination of speed and affordability – in fact since the 2023 model arrived it’s more affordable than ever, $100/£50 less than it was. It’s not only fast enough for general-purpose use, but its multi-core speed is quite good—if you use a professional app like a video editor, 3D software, or developer tools, the Mac mini can handle it, no problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> Because of its price and performance, the Mac mini is a great Mac for just about anybody. It makes for an ideal primary Mac for a home or small office. Professionals on a budget will be satisfied with the Mac mini. If you’re switching from a PC, you can use your PC’s keyboard and mouse with the Mac mini. The Mac mini is also ideal as a secondary Mac in your home, and it can integrate into your home entertainment center.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the Mac mini cost?</strong> There are three standard configurations starting at $599/£649 for the Mac mini M2 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 8GB unified memory and 256GB SSD, $799/£849 for the Mac mini M2 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 8GB unified memory and 512GB SSD, and $1,299/£1,399 for the Mac mini M2 Pro with 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 16GB unified memory and 512GB SSD. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> Apple sells three <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-219909-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini\">Mac mini models</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple 8-core M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 256GB SSD, $599/£649</li>\n\n<li>Apple 8-core M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, an 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, $799/£849</li>\n\n<li>Apple 10-core M2 Pro SoC with 16GB of memory, an 16-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, $1,299/£1399</li>\n\n<li>Additional options:  M2 Pro with 12-core CPU, 19-core GPU, 32GB unified memory. Up to 8TB SSD. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mac mini does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse, so you’ll have to provide your own, or you can customize your order to include these devices as extra-cost options.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> Like Apple’s other Macs, the Mac mini has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The $599 and $799 M2-based Mac minis have two Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports, while the M2 Pro-based Mac mini has four Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports. All Mac minis have two USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.0 port, a headphone jack, and a gigabit ethernet port.</p>\n\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671793/how-to-connect-an-external-monitor-to-your-mac.html\">connect a display</a>, you can use the HDMI port or a Thunderbolt port. You might have to buy an adapter if your display doesn’t have either HDMI or a port that can connect to Thunderbolt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it? </strong> The $599 and $799 M2-based Mac minis are very fast, and offer the best performance-to-price ratio of any Mac that Apple offers. The Mac mini with M2 Pro offers the same 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 16GB memory and 512GB storage that was found in the M2 Pro MacBook Pro for $1,299 rather than $1,999 which represented a huge saving and a great way to get a powerful Mac without spending a fortune. Now that Apple has updated the MacBook PRo with M3 Pro it’s only a matter of time before that chip makes its way to the Mac mini. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The Mac mini is an excellent machine for most Mac users—new or experienced, professional or general consumer. Plus the price is excellent: if you’re on a budget, it’s a great choice, especially if you already have a spare keyboard, mouse, and display. As we’ve already mentioned already, if you can afford to you should avoid the entry-level models due to slower SSDs. If you can, wait until spring 2024 for the M3 chip. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1479802/mac-mini-m2-pro-processor-design-memory-design.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Mac mini (M2, 2023) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 24-inch iMac (M3, 2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"3000\" height=\"1999\" alt=\"Apple 24-inch iMac (M3, 2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/m3-imac-orange-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299 base model\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-24-in-iMac-with-Retina-4-5K-Display-M3-chip-8C-CPU-8C-GPU-256GB-8GB-Pink-Fall-2023-MQRD3LL-A/5164268166&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-2137690-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1234 at  Walmart</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5BFRND?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$1,234.00 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmqrd3ll.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-219909-6-2137690-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1299 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Apple unveiled the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-219909-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac\">24-inch iMac</a> in April 2021 and then made us wait until October 2023 for the M3 version (with no M2 version ever launched). The resdesign in 2021 represented the first major update in more than a decade, with a cleaner design and a choice of bright colors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The iMac is great for both novices and demanding users. It can handle general-purpose and heavy-duty tasks equally well, although those after a replacement for a 27-inch IMac or iMac Pro might want to wait to see if the rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">iMac Pro</a> ever materializes, or settle for a Mac mini Pro (above) or Mac Studio (below). It’s ideal for someone who needs to buy a complete computer setup (keyboard, mouse or trackpad, and display) and wants to maximize workspace efficiency. The 24-inch iMac is a design icon that will look great in any office. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the iMac cost?</strong> Unfortunately, the iMac prices outside the U.S. went up in January 2023, making what was already an expensive machine even more expensive. Sadly Apple didn’t drop prices when the M3 iMac arrived so the three standard configurations still start at $1,299/£1,399 (was £1,249) for the entry-level model, $1,499/£1,599 (was £1,449) for the mid-range, and $1,699/£1,799 (was £1,649) for the top of the range. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> The 24-inch iMac uses Apple’s M3 chip, the same M3 that features in the 14-inch MacBook Pro. There are several configurations available as well as build-to-order options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M3 SoC with an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU; 8GB of memory; 256GB SSD, $1,299/£1,399</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 SoC with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU; 8GB of memory; 256GB SSD, $1,499/£1,599</li>\n\n<li>Apple M3 SoC with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU; 8GB of memory; 512GB SSD, $1,699/£1,799</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: 16GB or 24GB unified memory and up to 2TB SSD. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are the display specifications?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The 24-inch 4.5K Retina display has 11.3 million pixels and supports the P3 wide color gamut, over a billion colors, 500 nits of brightness, and True Tone. Apple treats the display with an anti-reflective coating to help with readability. The display hasn’t changed since the M1 model launched. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> The $1,299 24-inch iMac 24 has two Thunderbolt 3 ports that also work with USB-C devices. The $1,499 and $1,699 iMacs have two additional USB-C ports. If you have a USB-A device, you need to buy an adapter, such as Apple’s (<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-219909-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\">$19</a> / <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-219909-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ1M2ZM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">£19</a>). If you have multiple USB-A devices and other items, consider a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668894/best-thunderbolt-3-4-and-usb-c-docking-stations-for-macbook-pro-and-air.html\">Thunderbolt hub</a>. The 24-inch iMac also has a headphone jack on the side.</p>\n\n<p>The 24-inch iMac, unlike the older iMacs, does not have an SDXC slot. Once again, you’ll need an adapter, such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Reader-Memory-RS-MMC-Micro/dp/B07NW8RPYN?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Anker SD Card reader</a> ($17). However, it does have a super-cool magnetic power cord.</p>\n\n<p>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are built-in. Apple doesn’t put a gigabit ethernet port on the 24-inch iMac—instead, it’s on the power adapter. But that ethernet-equipped power adapter comes standard with the $1,499 and $1,699 models. It’s <em>not</em> included with the $1,299 model, but you can select it as an option at the point of purchase—and yes, that means you’ll have to pay extra for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?:</strong> Since the 24-inch iMac has the same M3 as the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, its speed is very similar. That means it’s fast, and it’s much faster than the M1 model it replaces–its even faster than the Intel-powered iMac Pro (discontinued some years ago). It’s got all the speed general consumers need, and it can handle pro applications with no problem. However, the $1,299 model has only one fan inside its body, while the $1,499 and $1,699 models have two fans. That means the high-priced models do a better job keeping the internals cool. The $1,299 model may need to slow down its performance on heavy-duty tasks in order to maintain a proper temperature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> Everything about the iMac was greatly improved with the 24-inch model, from the design to the display to its performance. More than two years on Apple finally got around to updating the chip from M1 to M3, which is great news. But, we hope rumors that Apple may launch an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">iMac Pro model</a> are true. If you are buying one the sweet spot is the $1,499/£1,599 model, which gets you more ports, Touch ID, and ethernet.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 24-inch iMac (M3, 2023)* review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMac Studio, M2 Max &amp; M2 Ultra (2023)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Mac Studio, M2 Max &amp; M2 Ultra (2023)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macstudiom2ultra.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The Mac Studio joined Apple’s Mac lineup in March 2022 and was updated in June 2023 when it gained the M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It’s a desktop “modular” Mac that’s more powerful (and more expensive) than the Mac mini and similarly speced to the Mac Pro, but lacking the Mac Pro’s expansion options.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The Mac Studio is for the user who wants the maximum processing power. It’s not the only powerful Mac available–the Mac Pro also runs on the M2 Ultra–but it is the cheapest way to get either the M2 Max or M2 Ultra chips. If you want the expansion options of the Mac Pro then you’ll want to look elsewhere, but the Mac Studio brings all the power usually reserved for the ultimate Mac in a small package. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the Mac Studio cost?</strong> There are two standard configurations starting at $1,999/£2,099 (was £1,999) for the Mac Studio M2 Max with 30-core GPU and 512GB SSD, and $3,999/£4,199 (was £3,999) for the Mac Studio M2 Ultra with 60-core GPU and 1TB SSD. There are also build to order options that include 76-core GPU, up to 192GB Unified Memory, and 8TB SSD. Fully maxed out a Mac Studio would cost $8,799/£8,999.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> The Mac Studio uses either the M2 Max or M2 Ultra processors. Apple offers two standard configurations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M2 Max SoC with a 12-core CPU, 30-core GPU, 32GB of memory, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, $1,999/£2,099</li>\n\n<li>Apple M2 Ultra SoC with a 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 64GB of memory, and a 32-core Neural Engine; 1TB SSD, $3,999/£4,199</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: M2 Ultra SoC with a 76-core GPU, up to 192GB unified memory and up to 8TB SSD. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mac Studio does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse, so you’ll have to provide your own, or you can customize your order to include these devices as extra-cost options. Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Studio Display</a> at the same time as the original Mac Studio, but it can be used with third-party displays, too. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Mac Studio has the following ports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>M2 Max: Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on back; two USB-C ports on front.</li>\n\n<li>M2 Ultra: Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on back; two Thunderbolt 4 ports on front.</li>\n\n<li>SDXC Card slot on front.</li>\n\n<li>Two USB-A ports.</li>\n\n<li>10Gb ethernet.</li>\n\n<li>HDMI 2.0.</li>\n\n<li>3.5 mm headphone jack (with advanced support for high-impedance headphones, a feature lacked by the M1-series models)</li>\n\n<li>802.11ax Wi-Fi 6E (was 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 in predecessor)</li>\n\n<li>Bluetooth 5.3 (was Bluetooth 5.0 in predecessor)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thunderbolt supports USB-C and USB-4. </p>\n\n<p>To connect to a network, you can use the built-in ethernet port, or you can use Wi-Fi, which comes standard.</p>\n\n<p>To connect a display, you can use the HDMI 2.0 port or the Thunderbolt ports. You might have to buy an adapter if your display doesn’t have either HDMI or a port that can connect to Thunderbolt. You can connect up to eight 4K displays, six 6K displays, or three 8K displays to the M2 Ultra. The M2 Max supports fewer displays.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> Despite the arrival of the M3 Max, the M2 Max Mac Studio is a very fast Mac at a very competitive price point. Once Apple adds the M3 Max as an option Its speed will be equal to that of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that feature the M3 Max, but even now it costs a fraction of the price: $1,999 compared to $3,199/£3,299 for the 14-inch and $3,599/£3,699 for the 16-inch, making it an excellent choice for anyone on a budget. </p>\n\n<p>Even with the arrival of the M3 Max, the M2 Ultra Mac Studio is Apple’s fastest chip, both in CPU and GPU speed. We expect that when the M3 Ultra arrives the speed gains will be great.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The Mac Studio is ideal for users who use processor- and graphics-intensive apps, such as media production, software development, graphics software, and more. If you find yourself spending a lot of time watching progress bars while you work, you’ll benefit from the power of the Mac Studio. The only question is whether you can wait until Apple upgrades the processors to M3 Max and M3 Ultra, which we anticipate happening around WWDC in June 2024. </p>\n\n<p>The only disadvantage is that the Mac Studio relies on external connections for expandability. If you want a pro-level Mac with the ability to swap expansion cards you should look at Apple silicon-based Mac Pro below.

It’s designed for professionals who need a powerful and flexible machine. Apple took its time to update the Mac Pro with its own silicon, but in June 2023, three and a half years after the previous update, the company finally came up with the goods. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The Mac Pro is designed for professionals who work with applications that use as many processing cores as possible—video-editing applications, image-editing software, 3D programs, audio editing, software developers, and the like.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does the Mac Pro cost?</strong> The Mac Pro starts at $6,999/£7,199 (which is up from the previous generation’s starting price of $5,999/£5,499). That’s for the Tower version, there is also a Rack mount version that starts at $7,499/£7,699. Those are the starting prices, you can choose various configuration options, such as the 76-core GPU and the 192GB unified memory and 8TB storage – just as with the Mac Studio. A fully specced out Mac Pro Tower costs $11,799/£11,999. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The specifications on offer are identical to the Mac Studio with M2 Ultra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple M2 Ultra SoC with a 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 64GB of memory, and a 32-core Neural Engine; 1TB SSD</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: M2 Ultra SoC with a 76-core GPU, up to 192GB unified memory and up to 8TB SSD. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Mac Pro has the following ports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>M2 Max: Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on back; two USB-C ports on front.</li>\n\n<li>M2 Ultra: Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on back; two Thunderbolt 4 ports on front.</li>\n\n<li>SDXC Card slot on front.</li>\n\n<li>Two USB-A ports.</li>\n\n<li>10Gb ethernet.</li>\n\n<li>HDMI 2.0.</li>\n\n<li>3.5 mm headphone jack (with advanced support for high-impedance headphones, a feature lacked by the M1-series models)</li>\n\n<li>802.11ax Wi-Fi 6E (was 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 in predecessor)</li>\n\n<li>Bluetooth 5.3 (was Bluetooth 5.0 in predecessor)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To connect a display, you can use the HDMI 2.0 port or the Thunderbolt ports. You might have to buy an adapter if your display doesn’t have either HDMI or a port that can connect to Thunderbolt. You can connect up to eight 4K displays, six 6K displays or three 8K displays. </p>\n\n<p>To connect external devices, the Mac Pro has eight Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, three USB-A ports, two HDMI ports, and Dual 10Gb Ethernet. But the real draw for creative pros will be the seven PCI Express expansion slots, one of which comes with an Apple I/O card installed. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> Apple says the 2023 Mac Pro is up to 3x faster than the previous-generation Intel-based model. With support for 192GB of unified memory, Apple says the Mac Pro supports “more memory than the most advanced workstation graphics cards, taking on demanding workloads other systems can’t even process.” Apple says that, like the M2 Ultra Mac Studio, the M2 Ultra Mac Pro can plan an “unprecedented 22 streams of 8K ProRes video.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> The Mac Pro provides the processing power that the most demanding users need. We’re talking about production environments, like TV and audio recording studios, animation houses, and software developers. If you feel like you can never have enough power, you’re probably the professional the Mac Pro is aimed at. But if you don’t need the expandability then the Mac Studio will probably be adequate. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re more of a “prosumer” than a professional—someone who is an expert Mac user, but doesn’t use high-end apps—the Mac Pro is overkill. You’re probably not going to be able to take advantage of what the Mac Pro has to offer.</p>\n\n<p>You just need to figure out whether you want to wait until June 2024, or possibly longer, for the M3 Ultra. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13-inch MacBook Pro, M2 (2022)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"13-inch MacBook Pro, M2 (2022)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/13inch-macbook-pro-2020.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6509654/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-782227-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1099 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-MacBook-Pro-M2-chip-13-inch-8GB-RAM-256GB-Touch-Bar-Silver/1000984396&amp;subid1=1-1-219909-6-782227-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1239 at  Walmart</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3C57XLR?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$1,259.93 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Apple no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Pro, but we’ll include it for now because it’s likely that stock will be available for some time to come.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The now discontinued 13-inch MacBook Pro features an M2 chip and was introduced in June 2022. This model comes with 10-core GPU and either 256GB SSD or 512GB SSD. The “Pro” in the MacBook Pro name is meant to signify that this is a Mac that’s designed for those who are more demanding than the Air user (whose main focus is on portability). However, when comparing the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro the differences were quite narrow. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for?</strong> The 13-inch MacBook Pro is for a more demanding user than the MacBook Air. We’ve always suggested that the 13-inch MacBook Pro would have been better described as a MacBook to better differentiate it from its larger siblings. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much did the 13-inch MacBook Pro cost</strong>: There were two configurations starting at $1,299/£1,349 for the MacBook Pro M2 with 256GB SSD and $1,499/£1,549 for the MacBook Pro M2 with 512GB SSD. You should look out for decent discounts on these models while they are still being sold by Apple resellers, or in <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-219909-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s refurbished store</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the specifications?</strong> Apple offered two standard configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple 8-core M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, a 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 256GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, was $1,299/£1,349</li>\n\n<li>Apple 8-core M2 SoC with 8GB of memory, a 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine; 512GB SSD, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, was $1,499/£1,549</li>\n\n<li>Additional options: 16GB or 24GB unified memory. Up to 2TB storage. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are display specifications?</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 13.3-inch Retina display had a native resolution of 2,560×1,600, and 500 nits brightness. The 14-inch MacBook Pro that replaces the 13-inch model has a much better display. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is the Touch Bar?</strong> The 13-inch MacBook Pro model was the only MacBook Pro to still include the Touch Bar interface at the top of the keyboard. Other Mac laptops used to have this feature, but it was only retained on the 13-inch model. Now it’s gone from the line-up, so if you want the Touch Bar which offers a strip of digital buttons and controls that change depending on the software you are using, you’ll need to get one before they sell out.  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229041/hands-on-the-macbook-pros-innovative-touch-bar-will-grab-you.html\">Learn more about the Touch Bar</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I connect stuff?</strong> The 13-inch MacBook Pro offered Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the wired connectivity you need to be concerned with. The 13-inch MacBook Pro has only two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports that are compatible with USB-C. If you have a Thunderbolt device, you can plug it directly into the laptop. The same goes for any USB-C device. However, if you have wired devices that aren’t USB-C or are an older version of Thunderbolt, you’ll need an adapter. We have a separate <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229045/thunderbolt-3-adapter-m1-imac-macbook-pro-mac-mini-usb-displayport-hdmi-ethernet.html\">MacBook Pro Thunderbolt adapter guide</a> to help you decide which ones you’ll need. Unfortunately, be prepared to shell out a good amount of extra cash.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How fast is it?</strong> The 13-inch MacBook Pro with M2 matched the M2-powered MacBook Air, which isn’t surprising as they have the same processor. But the MacBook Pro’s design lends itself to being better at keeping cool and maintaining its speed, while the thinner MacBook Air needs to throttle down for long processing tasks. When the MacBook Air is updated to the M3 the gap between these two machines will widen. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> If you see a 13-inch MacBook Pro on sale at a good price then you might be wondering whether to buy it. If you need a low-cost Mac that is capable to strenuous work then it is still a better option than the M2 MacBook Air. But, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 offers a significant speed boost over the older 13-inch model, not to mention the display improvements. That Mac has a much higher starting price than the 13-inch model did though. If your work mostly involves web surfing and other productivity tasks go for a MacBook Air. </p>\n\n<p>We compare all the MacBook Pro here:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/545699/macbook-pro-13-vs-14-16-inch-comparison-difference.html\">Which MacBook Pro: 14-inch vs 16-inch compared</a>.
