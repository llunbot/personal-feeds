The Meta-owned messaging app is extremely popular in Europe owing to its cross-platform compatibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn recent years Meta invested heavily in U.S. marketing campaigns, including high-visibility ad placements in Times Square and television spots emphasizing privacy and end-to-end encryption. A recent campaign featured the cast of the TV show \"Modern Family\" highlighting WhatsApp's cross-platform capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe milestone of 100 million users is particularly impressive given the competition from iMessage, which has been the preferred messaging service for many <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users due to its default, seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem. However, WhatsApp's ability to offer a unified messaging experience across different devices apparently resonates with a significant portion of the American population, especially in major cities like Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Seattle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhatsApp's milestone comes at a time when the ‌iPhone‌'s messaging landscape is poised for further changes. Apple is set to introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">Rich Communication Services (RCS)</a> in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> later this year, a move that should significantly enhance the functionality of messages sent between iPhones and Android devices. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a> offers features like high-quality media sharing, read receipts, and typing indicators, which could potentially reduce the need for third-party apps like WhatsApp for advanced messaging capabilities. However, it is notable that ‌RCS‌ does not offer end-to-end encryption – a key WhatsApp feature.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/\">United States</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/28/whatsapp-reaches-100-million-monthly-us-users/\">WhatsApp Reaches 100 Million Monthly Users in the United States</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-reaches-100-million-monthly-users-in-the-united-states.2432410/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"119b5d10f7a617ebda2f0a1f91811bd7b2c5b06a3c2c9f6373d3d4863689963c","category":"Apple"}
