As part of this project, the agency is seeking reusable, affordable transportation to the Moon and back. It conducted a competition for a human lander (HLS) and announced in April that it would <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/nasa-selects-spacex-as-its-sole-provider-for-a-lunar-lander/\">move forward with SpaceX</a> and its Starship proposal. NASA had wanted two providers for such a lander, but due to low appropriations from Congress, it could afford only one.</p>\n\n<p>Now, three months later, Bezos is offering to make up the difference out of his pocket. \"Blue Origin will bridge the HLS budgetary funding shortfall by waiving all payments in the current and next two government fiscal years up to $2B to get the program back on track right now,\" Bezos wrote. \"This offer is not a deferral but is an outright and permanent waiver of those payments. This offer provides time for government appropriation actions to catch up.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783050#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783050&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"652301841857a90bcd8224df40945f57d8ec65bfc899f8f80c5a2633b75ecc8b","category":"Tech"}
