The back glass is strengthened with an optimised dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a luxurious, textured matte finish.\"</blockquote>According to the Weibo-based leaker \"Fixed focus digital,\" who <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5821279480/Oc5UGclf7\">claims to have seen the iPhone 16 color scheme</a>, Apple will use the same process for the back glass on the new models, which could come in as many as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/iphone-16-plus-rumored-to-come-in-these-7-colors/\">seven colors this year</a> as opposed to five.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/all-the-rumored-iphone-16-colors/\">iPhone 16 Models Rumored to Come in These Colors</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nLate last month, <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6315816381/5017601013189904\">another Weibo source</a> suggested Apple could extend its dual-ion exchange glass process to the back of the iPhone 16 Pro, which is expected to have the same titanium frame as the iPhone 15 Pro. However, the source of today's leak does not mention the premium iPhone 16 models, and both Weibo accounts have yet to establish a track record for accurate Apple rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 16 series around its usual mid-September timeframe.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/iphone-16-color-infused-back-glass/\">iPhone 16 Again Rumored to Feature Color-Infused Back Glass</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-again-rumored-to-feature-color-infused-back-glass.2425185/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ee5db46adc53232f6800e6a7936374fc642a4443fce822542a114d783046280","category":"Apple"}
