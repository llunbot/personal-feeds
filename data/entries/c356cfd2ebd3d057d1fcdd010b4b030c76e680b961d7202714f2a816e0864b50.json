An obvious addition to their Morse bottle cage lineup, the new cargo cage is typically Wolf Tooth â€“ meaning well thought out and packed with versatility. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Morse Cargo Cage background\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_1-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Morse cages get their name from the dot-dash mounting pattern. The Cargo cage is no different with four different bolt-hole combinations for the standard 64mm bottle boss spacing. It will also fit on three-pack mounting, and offers up to 35mm of vertical adjustment thanks to the Morse pattern. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-BSE-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-BSE-Large-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Morse Cargo Cage close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-BSE-Large-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-BSE-Large-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-BSE-Large-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-BSE-Large-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-BSE-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For more versatility, the cage also has mounting holes on the left or right side of the cage which allows it to be mounted at an angle. WTC says this is great for forks that have mounting bolts on the front or back of the fork leg, and will even allow you to mount two cages next to each other in certain situations. The cages are made in Minnesota, USA from 5052 aluminum. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP-Large-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Morse Cargo Cage with cargo straps\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP-Large-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP-Large-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP-Large-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP-Large-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP_02-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP_02-Large-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Morse Cargo Cage with cargo straps mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP_02-Large-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP_02-Large-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP_02-Large-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP_02-Large-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MORSE-CARGO-STRP_02-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Morse Cargo Cage carrying bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_10-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Morse Cargo Cage for Nalgene bottle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wolf-Tooth_Morse-Cargo-Cage_7-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the bottle cage, WTC is introducing its own Cargo straps that will be sold with the cages or separately.
