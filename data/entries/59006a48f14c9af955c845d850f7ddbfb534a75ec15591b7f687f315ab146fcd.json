The iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, macOS 13.5.2, and watchOS 9.6.2 updates patch the flaws across all of Apple's platforms. As of this writing, no updates have been released for older versions like iOS 15 or macOS 12.</p>\n<p>The CVE-2023-41064 and CVE-2023-41061 flaws were <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/\">reported</a> by the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs &amp; Public Policy at the University of Toronto. Also dubbed \"BLASTPASS,\" Citizen Lab says that the bugs are serious because they can be exploited just by loading an image or attachment, which happens regularly in Safari, Messages, WhatsApp, and other first- and third-party apps. These bugs are also called \"zero-click\" or \"clickless\" vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Citizen Lab also said that the BLASTPASS bug was \"being used to deliver NSO Group’s <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/found-quite-possibly-the-most-sophisticated-android-espionage-app-ever/\">Pegasus mercenary spyware</a>,\" the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/clickless-exploits-from-israeli-firm-hacked-activists-fully-updated-iphones/\">latest</a> in a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/\">long line</a> of similar exploits that have been used to infect fully patched iOS and Android devices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966414#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966414&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"59006a48f14c9af955c845d850f7ddbfb534a75ec15591b7f687f315ab146fcd","category":"Tech"}
