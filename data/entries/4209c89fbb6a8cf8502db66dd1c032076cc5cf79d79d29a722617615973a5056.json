With its strong hydraulic ratio of 9mm at the pump piston to 14/17mm in the caliper, it bulldozes the brake oil into the four pistons with serious oomph – and brings you safely to a standstill when those unexpected obstacles jump out of nowhere. Heat-resistant hollow stainless steel pistons and Bionol brake oil prevent interrupting the flow during top-to-bottom runs with unnecessary cool-down breaks, unless you need one yourself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_C42-caliper.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_C42-caliper.webp\" alt=\"Trickstuff Piccola HD Titanium lightweight 4-piston MTB brakes, caliper\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_C42-caliper.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_C42-caliper-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_C42-caliper-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_C42-caliper-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_C42-caliper-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_lever.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_lever.webp\" alt=\"Trickstuff Piccola HD Titanium lightweight 4-piston MTB brakes, lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_lever.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_lever-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_lever-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_lever-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_lever-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>lightweight 4-piston brakes, made in Freiburg, Germany</li>\n\n\n\n<li>14mm &amp; 17mm diameter pistons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3D-printed titanium brake levers, with 2mm reach adjust</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CNC-machined, anodized aluminum pump &amp; caliper</li>\n\n\n\n<li>angled hose connection at the lever body (pump)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>adjustable banjo connection at the post mount caliper</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kevlar brake hoses</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bionol brake fluid</li>\n\n\n\n<li>14.5g 3D-printed titanium lever including 2 sealed bearings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>230g rear brake weight (includes pump, lever, caliper, pads, pad retaining bolt, safety clip &amp; clamp)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>212g front brake weight</li>\n\n\n\n<li>442g total brakeset weight</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trickstuff Piccola HD Titanium – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options.webp\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options.webp\" alt=\"Trickstuff Piccola HD Titanium lightweight 4-piston MTB brakes, color options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options-1536x768.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options-768x384.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trickstuff-Piccola-HD-Titanium-lightweight-4-piston-MTB-brakes_color-options-2048x1024.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Trickstuff Piccola HD Titanium are available now for 1100€ for the pair.
