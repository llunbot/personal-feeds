Nvidia announced it today as part of its pre-Gamescom presentations. The remaster will use RTX Remix, Nvidia's toolkit, for bringing ray-tracing to classic PC games. RTX Remix was previously announced using <em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</em> as an example; it seeks to give community modders and hobbyists the ability to do ray-tracing conversions for old games, but it's still only available to a few people.</p>\n<p>The people, in this case, are a group of modders from multiple community projects who have banded together under the name Orbifold Studios. The team includes modders who worked on VR <em>Half-Life 2</em> project <em>Project 17</em>, asset remastering project <em>Half-Life 2 Remade Assets</em>, total conversation mod <em>Raising the Bar: Redux,</em> and another VR mod simply called <em>Half-Life 2 VR</em>, among others.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962207#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962207&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6758279657a8080c6a514858a368e71c0c40991bffaa93cfffc55ed675377bee","category":"Tech"}
