This time the Amazon sale is dubbed Prime Big Deal Days and it will run from just after midnight Tuesday, October 8 to midnight Wednesday, October 9. In our experience you can get discounts on Macs all year round, but, some of the best Mac discounts fall during Amazon’s sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amazon <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/prime-day\">Prime Day</a> sale is a great time way to save some money when buying a new Mac. The October sale comes at a time when you might be thinking about your holiday shopping, plus with new Macs (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html\">MacBook Pro</a>) expected later in October, now could be a great time to pick up some bargains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you will find links to the different types of Mac desktops available on Amazon, so it will be easy to find the best deals. If you aren’t sure which Mac to buy read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/219909/best-mac.html\">Mac buying guide</a> where we compare every Mac and MacBook. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Macs picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 48 hours of Amazon October Prime Deals Day we will be tracking the sales, so be sure to check this page often as the deals change constantly.
