If you want to watch live, be there or be square. I am, I will admit, nervous — I am anything but a natural stage performer — but so very excited to be back in the big theater for the first time in four years. (!) It’s a beautiful space, and I do so enjoy meeting the readers and listeners who attend. The enthusiasm from the audience is always palpable, and so energizing. All year long, as I write and record podcasts, I <em>know</em> I have a big audience out there. But man, when I walk out on stage at the WWDC live show, I can <em>feel</em> it. It’s quite a thing.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t wait to see you there. Should be a good one this year, too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/23/tickets-for-the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2023\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1fd7a43cbcf1303432dd01bb4170c0e7790910f035d3ae76d03dced3f227ec47","category":"Tech"}
