If you are looking for discounts on other Apple gadgets we have gathered all the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/best-apple-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">best Apple deals for Cyber Monday</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook deals for Cyber Monday 2024: Our advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things to consider before you make a purchase. Apple released the newest M4 MacBook Pro models in late October 2024. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models bring new M4 chips, but they also offer more RAM than the previous generation. This means that when considering deals on older M3 Macs it is important to account for the fact that there may be less RAM in those models, especially since Apple usually charges $200/£200 to upgrade from 8GB to 16GB. Also M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBooks had less RAM previously, now they have 24GB RAM as standard, rather than 18GB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn’t only apply to the MacBook Pro. When the M4 MacBook Pro was introduced, Apple also doubled the RAM in the M3 MacBook Air from 8GB to 16GB as standard, effectively a $200/£200 price cut. So it is important to pay attention to how much RAM is included in an M3 MacBook Air, or you might not be getting the bargain you think you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best MacBook Pro deals for Cyber Monday

Rather, it gives away gift cards when you buy certain items. For <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Apple’s Black Friday deal</a> in 2024, it is giving gift cards with the MacBook Air purchases made on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.S. site</a> or <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.K. site</a>. Since they are so new, the M4 MacBook Pro models, Mac mini, and iMac aren’t included for 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>2024</strong></td><td><strong>2023</strong></td><td><strong>2022</strong></td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air</td><td>$200</td><td>$200</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>13-inch MacBook Air</td><td>$175</td><td>$175</td><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>13-inch MacBook Air (M2)</td><td>$150</td><td>$150</td><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini</td><td>–</td><td>$100</td><td>$100</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch &amp; 16-inch MacBook Pro</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>$250</td></tr><tr><td>iMac</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>$150</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Apple’s Black Friday/Cyber Monday offer worth it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to buy a MacBook Air in 2024 from Apple, taking advantage of Apple’s deal will mean you get a $200/£160 Apple Gift Card with purchases of the 15-inch MacBook Air (M3), a $175/£140 Apple Gift Card with a 13-inch MacBook Air (M3), and $150/£120 Apple Gift Card with a 13-inch MacBook Air (M2). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying from Apple means you are guaranteed to be buying the latest MacBook Air with 16GB RAM as standard, whereas other resellers may be clearing old stock with 8GB RAM. You then have a voucher to spend on other products from Apple – and since many of us have money going out on a monthly basis thanks to subscriptions, this could be a real saving where it matters.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\"> Get Apple's Cyber Monday offer (U.S.)</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/gifts/shopping-event\" target=\"_blank\"> Get Apple's Cyber Monday offer (U.K.)</a></div>\n\n\n<p>However, there are plenty of good deals to be found, as detailed above. Just make sure you are buying the 16GB RAM model or getting a reasonable discount if not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cyber Monday shopping tips</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We tend to find that the biggest savings are on older models, but be aware that these aren’t always the best value for money.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check the generation of the model that is discounted to make sure you know exactly what you are buying and what it’s really worth. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>We’ve seen resellers switch to selling refurbished or used when the stock of brand-new models run out, so check that the model discounted isn’t actually a used Mac and therefore not as good a deal as it might look. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>That’s not to say you should avoid refurb models – you just need to make sure that you aren’t buying refurb without knowing. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac deals aren’t limited to Black Friday. We see good deals all year round, so don’t feel pressured into buying during Black Friday. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to get Cyber Monday Mac deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many resellers offer Black Friday discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.adorama.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a> has 14 days of deals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> runs weeks of Black Friday sales.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy’s</a> Black Friday sale has started. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/holiday-shopping/deals\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a> has a Holiday Head Start sale. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals/black-friday\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart’s</a> Black Friday deals have already started.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.krcs.co.uk/black-friday/\" target=\"_blank\">KRCS</a> has already reduced Mac prices by 10%. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ao.com/deals?WT.ac=Homepage%7CHomepage%7CTakeover%7C1%7CBF23Overarching%7COffer\" target=\"_blank\">AO.com</a> has various Black Friday savings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/content/black-friday\" target=\"_blank\">Laptops Direct’s</a> Black Friday sale has started. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/blackfriday\" target=\"_blank\">eBuyer</a> has a Black Friday Early Access Sale with up to 45% off. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.very.co.uk/e/promo/black-friday-all-very.end?numProducts=100\" target=\"_blank\">Very</a>‘s Black Friday sales are underway.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/black-friday/c6000670128\" target=\"_blank\">John Lewis</a> is running Black Friday deals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/black-friday\" target=\"_blank\">Currys</a> has up to 40% off for Black Friday.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/events/black-friday\" target=\"_blank\">Argos</a> has a price promise that the prices won’t go any lower for Black Friday.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/blackfriday\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> has weeks of Black Friday sales.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cyber Monday 2024: Best deals for Apple products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Apple’s Cyber Monday 2024 sale</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375970/best-apple-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 Apple deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373696/best-mac-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 Mac Deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/best-macbook-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 MacBook deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1377158/best-airpods-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 AirPods deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1376743/best-apple-watch-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 Apple Watch deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/best-ipad-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 iPad deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-iphone-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 iPhone deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375200/best-mac-monitor-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 Mac monitor deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373771/best-mac-storage-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 SSD and external hard drive deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677125/best-apple-accessory-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Cyber Monday 2024 Apple accessory deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2531213/black-friday-deals-on-mac-thunderbolt-usb-c-docks-hubs.html\">Best Cyber Monday deals on Mac Thunderbolt and USB-C docks and hubs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2531982/black-friday-deals-on-iphone-and-macbook-chargers.html\">BestCyber Monday deals on iPhone and MacBook chargers</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2534419/best-black-friday-deals-on-magsafe-magnetic-wireless-chargers-and-power-banks.html\">Best Cyber Monday deals on MagSafe wireless chargers and power banks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>AMAZON LIGHTNING DEALS</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Check out these time-limited tech deals before they go.
