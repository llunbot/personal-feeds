An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.3 introduces a Stolen Device Protection feature that limits access to your private information in case someone obtains both your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and your passcode. When activated, it requires <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> identity verification to do things like accessing passwords in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, making purchases through Safari with saved payment credentials, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are also features that require verification <em>and</em> have a one-hour delay to access, such as changing an ‌Apple ID‌ passcode, an ‌iPhone‌ passcode, turning off <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>, and turning off ‌Face ID‌. More details can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/\">found in our article on Stolen Device Protection</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also adds <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/\">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> subscribers share playlists with others to build shared song lists. Collaborative playlists are simple to use, can be shared with a link, and support emoji reactions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, Apple pulled the second betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 after the updates caused devices to go into a perpetual boot loop. Apple did not re-release the second betas, but presumably the issue is fixed in the third betas. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release iOS 17.3 later in January.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-releases-ios-17-3-beta-3-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-betas-of-ios-17-3-and-ipados-17-3-to-developers.2415892/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35f9e006874ef6f900f17ce758fa93435e2c55753072c0fff6e50afd855b35a8","category":"Apple"}
