{"title":"Take That CIRP Survey on Apple Customer Device Ownership With a Giant Grain of Salt","link":"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/06/cirp-survey-ipad-popularity#update","date":1749255515000,"content":"\n<p>I posted this update a bit ago, but it’s worth making a separate post so you don’t miss it if you read the original post before I added the update:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It goes without saying that any consumer survey is only as good as\nthe surveyor. But CIRP, in particular, has posted some dubious\nones, to say the least. <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@lapcatsoftware/114638324316925437\">Jeff Johnson pointed out on Mastodon</a>\nthat back in 2023, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/09/apples-most-popular-mac/\">CIRP published a survey that claimed the Mac\nPro accounted for 43 percent</a> of all Mac desktop sales, with\nthe Mac Mini and Mac Studio each accounting for only 4 percent\neach. That’s just bananas. That’s not like <em>maybe wrong</em>, that’s\nnot <em>gotta be a little wrong</em>, that’s <em>how could anyone publish\nthis?</em> wrong. It’s hard to believe anything from CIRP after they\npublished that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/06/cirp-update\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9af68f4beaf722b4c392f9d6bbe33700c95896b3ed1648de60bed171a0c1d0ac","category":"Tech"}
