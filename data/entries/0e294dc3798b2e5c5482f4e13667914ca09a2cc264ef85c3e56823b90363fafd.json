(Throughout\nthe course of his presidency, Trump referred to flag officers as\n“my generals.”) According to Baker and Glasser, Kelly explained to\nTrump that German generals “tried to kill Hitler three times and\nalmost pulled it off.” This correction did not move Trump to\nreconsider his view: “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him,”\nthe president responded.</p>\n\n<p>This week, I asked Kelly about their exchange. He told me that\nwhen Trump raised the subject of “German generals,” Kelly\nresponded by asking, “‘Do you mean Bismarck’s generals?’” He went\non: “I mean, I knew he didn’t know who Bismarck was, or about the\nFranco-Prussian War. I said, ‘Do you mean the kaiser’s generals?\nSurely you can’t mean <em>Hitler’s</em> generals? And he said, ‘Yeah,\nyeah, Hitler’s generals.’ I explained to him that Rommel had to\ncommit suicide after taking part in a plot against Hitler.” Kelly\ntold me Trump was not acquainted with Rommel. [...]</p>\n\n<p>As president, Trump evinced extreme sensitivity to criticism from\nretired flag officers; at one point, he proposed calling back to\nactive duty Admiral William McRaven and General Stanley\nMcChrystal, two highly regarded Special Operations leaders who had\nbecome critical of Trump, so that they could be court-martialed.\nEsper, who was the defense secretary at the time, wrote in his\nmemoir that he and Milley talked Trump out of the plan. [...]\nTrump has responded incredulously when told that American military\npersonnel swear an oath to the Constitution, not to the president.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s no hope for the deep-MAGA derps who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/12/trump-racist-rhetoric-immigrants-00183537\">actually cheer this on</a>. Trump’s hope for another electoral victory, however, depends upon large swaths of conservative, or even just conservative-ish, voters who don’t take him seriously, who haven’t paid attention to all the red flags and evidence from his first term, and think he doesn’t mean what he says. He says a lot of crazy shit, yes, but when he talks about what he wants to do, he means it. There’s very little he said he wanted to do in his first term that he either didn’t do, or didn’t try to do.</p>\n\n<p>Goldberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On separate occasions in 2020, Trump held private conversations in\nthe White House with national-security officials about the George\nFloyd protests. “The Chinese generals would know what to do,” he\nsaid, according to former officials who described the\nconversations to me, referring to the leaders of the People’s\nLiberation Army, which carried out the Tiananmen Square massacre\nin 1989. (Pfeiffer denied that Trump said this.) Trump’s desire to\ndeploy U.S. troops against American citizens is well documented.\nDuring the nerve-racking period of social unrest following Floyd’s\ndeath, Trump asked Milley and Esper, a West Point graduate and\nformer infantry officer, if the Army could shoot protesters.\n“Trump seemed unable to think straight and calmly,” Esper wrote in\nhis memoir. “The protests and violence had him so enraged that he\nwas willing to send in active-duty forces to put down the\nprotesters. Worse yet, he suggested we shoot them. I wondered\nabout his sense of history, of propriety, and of his oath to the\nConstitution.” Esper told National Public Radio in 2022, “We\nreached that point in the conversation where he looked frankly at\nGeneral Milley, and said, ‘Can’t you just shoot them, just shoot\nthem in the legs or something?’” When defense officials argued\nagainst Trump’s desire, the president screamed, according to\nwitnesses, “You are all fucking losers!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s some hope our military leadership would resist such orders again. But there won’t be any civilian leaders like John Kelly or Mark Esper in a second Trump administration. It’d be sycophants all the way down.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/22/trump-hitler-generals\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0e294dc3798b2e5c5482f4e13667914ca09a2cc264ef85c3e56823b90363fafd","category":"Tech"}
