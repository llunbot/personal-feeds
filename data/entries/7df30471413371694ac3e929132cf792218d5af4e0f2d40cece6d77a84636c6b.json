NSO Group Complaint (PDF)","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Apple_v_NSO_Complaint_112321.pdf","date":1637714356000,"content":"\n<p>The opening paragraph:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Defendants are notorious hackers — amoral 21st century\nmercenaries who have created highly sophisticated\ncyber-surveillance machinery that invites routine and flagrant\nabuse. They design, develop, sell, deliver, deploy, operate, and\nmaintain offensive and destructive malware and spyware products\nand services that have been used to target, attack, and harm Apple\nusers, Apple products, and Apple. For their own commercial gain,\nthey enable their customers to abuse those products and services\nto target individuals including government officials, journalists,\nbusinesspeople, activists, academics, and even U.S. citizens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It gets more strident from there.</p>\n\n<p>I genuinely wonder what Apple’s goals are with this suit. Is it just to bring NSO Group’s activities to light? If this goes to trial, the testimony should really be something to see. How much in damages will Apple seek at trial? Enough to bankrupt to NSO Group?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/23/apple-v-nso-complaint\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7df30471413371694ac3e929132cf792218d5af4e0f2d40cece6d77a84636c6b","category":"Tech"}
