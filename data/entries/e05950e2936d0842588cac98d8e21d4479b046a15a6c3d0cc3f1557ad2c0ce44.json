When a new user signs up, the user will need to pay the fee, or wait for three months to be able to engage on the network. The updated language on the Twitter site:\r<br />\n<blockquote>New accounts are required to pay a small annual fee before you're able to post, like, bookmark, and reply. This is to reduce spam and create a better experience for everyone. You can still follow accounts and browse X for free.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThe text does not mention being able to post for free after three months, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1779939517278957714\">Musk confirmed</a> that \"write actions\" would be free after that time period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear how the policy will stop spam accounts and bots, as spammers will be able to pay the fee or simply create multiple accounts and wait to be able to post. Regular users, meanwhile, could be discouraged from using X due to the extra step and the fact that other social networks are free.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fee appears to be around $1, as it costs $1.75 NZD in New Zealand. The pay-for-access policy has not yet been implemented outside of New Zealand and the Philippines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMusk said that fake accounts also use up \"the available namespace\" limiting the \"good handles.\" X has freed up over a million usernames so far, and will \"free up tens of millions in the coming weeks.\"<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/x-small-fee-new-users/\">X May Charge New Users a 'Small Fee' to Post, Like and Reply</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/x-may-charge-new-users-a-small-fee-to-post-like-and-reply.2424255/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e05950e2936d0842588cac98d8e21d4479b046a15a6c3d0cc3f1557ad2c0ce44","category":"Apple"}
