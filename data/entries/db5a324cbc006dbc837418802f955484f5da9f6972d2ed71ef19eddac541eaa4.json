{"title":"iFixit Shares M4 Mac Mini Teardown","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/ifixit-m4-mac-mini-teardown/","date":1731441561000,"content":"Popular repair site iFixit today disassembled one of Apple's new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a> machines for a teardown video that gives us a more complete look at the inside of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nCompared to the prior version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, the M4 model is densely packed with little space between components, which is how Apple slimmed down the size so much. The ‌M4 Mac mini‌ measures in at 5x5 inches, down from 7.5x7.5 inches, a size reduction that makes a major difference.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe power supply module is a board that extends across the top of the case, a design that Apple has previously used for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>. The power supply normally takes up a lot of space, so that's how Apple shrunk it down without compromising performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the middle of the ‌Mac mini‌, there's a fan that works with the redesigned thermal management system of the machine to pull in air from the environment, circulate it through each level of the ‌Mac mini‌, and then vent it out through the bottom. Because the M4 Pro versions of the ‌Mac mini‌ need more cooling power, Apple equipped them with a larger copper heatsink than the heatsink in the standard ‌M4 Mac mini‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit is a little late to the ‌Mac mini‌ teardown, which means we have seen <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-teardown/\">prior videos</a> that provided some insight into the machine's internal components. We've already learned that the ‌Mac mini‌ has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/09/more-teardown-and-storage-upgrade/\">modular storage</a> that can technically be upgraded after purchase, and iFixit confirmed that. iFixit swapped a 512GB SSD from one ‌M4 Mac mini‌ to another ‌M4 Mac mini‌ that had a 256GB SSD, and the swap was successful.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M4 and M4 Pro ‌Mac mini‌ models use different NAND modules that aren't physically interchangeable, and iFixit was not able to use an M4 SSD in an M4 Pro ‌Mac mini‌, so users who plan to swap out their own storage will need to make sure to get the correct SSD for their device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRAM for the ‌Mac mini‌ is tightly integrated into the M4 chip inside and is not upgradeable after purchase, and the ports are also soldered, which can make replacement difficult.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit found other components in the ‌Mac mini‌ are simple to swap out, and the site gave the ‌Mac mini‌ a repairability score of 7 out of 10 thanks to the easy to remove components, swappable SSD, and the detailed repair manuals that Apple made available. iFixit says users could get at least a decade of use out of the ‌M4 Mac mini‌.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/ifixit-m4-mac-mini-teardown/\">iFixit Shares M4 Mac Mini Teardown</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-m4-mac-mini-teardown.2442793/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db5a324cbc006dbc837418802f955484f5da9f6972d2ed71ef19eddac541eaa4","category":"Apple"}
