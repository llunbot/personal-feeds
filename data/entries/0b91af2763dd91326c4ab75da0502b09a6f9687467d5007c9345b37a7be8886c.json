This was likely to be a conservative estimate, the group said, because of the secrecy around some of the deals.</p>\n<p>With three months still to go, 2021 already has the largest yearly tally since Good Jobs First began collecting the data in 2000, excluding incentives for non-logistics projects, such as filmmaking and office development, and the more than $750 million package Amazon was awarded in 2019 to build its “second” headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801593#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801593&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b91af2763dd91326c4ab75da0502b09a6f9687467d5007c9345b37a7be8886c","category":"Tech"}
