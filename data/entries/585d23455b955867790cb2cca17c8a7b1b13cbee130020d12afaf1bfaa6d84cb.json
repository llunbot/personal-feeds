But today it’s an even better value: <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-homepod-mini-midnight/6377594.p?skuId=6377594\">Best Buy is selling the HomePod mini for $80</a>, savings of $20. This HomePod mini rarely ever goes on sale, so if you’ve been waiting for a price drop to get one, now’s the time to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s compact smart speaker is a great way to bring Siri into your home—which is quite likely the main reason you’re looking into getting one of these—allowing the smart assistant to play music for you, set timers, look up things online, send messages, make calls, and so on, even when your iPhone is across the house. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you’re looking for an everyday music player, weather forecaster, simple question answerer, and light switch, it’ll work a bit better than one of the super-low-priced alternatives, especially if you’re already invested in the Apple universe,” <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234895/homepod-mini-review.html\">our review</a> reads. We gave the speaker a 3.5-star rating in our review, appreciating its design and size, decent audio, and excellent volume. We would have given it a higher score had similar speakers not been a lot more affordable—and this price cut helps out a lot there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So get Siri home with the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-homepod-mini-midnight/6377594.p?skuId=6377594\">HomePod mini for $80 at Best Buy</a>, an extremely rare discount.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-homepod-mini-midnight/6377594.p?skuId=6377594\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Best Buy</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"585d23455b955867790cb2cca17c8a7b1b13cbee130020d12afaf1bfaa6d84cb","category":"Apple"}
