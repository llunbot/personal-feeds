One of them is that Goldberg, a journalist\nwho Donald Trump loathes for his past reporting (remember the\n<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/\">“suckers and losers” piece</a>), somehow became the unintended\nrecipient of high-level, real-time military intelligence from\ninside his own inner circle. One wonders whether any heads will\nroll as a result of the whole matter. On Monday, Trump again made\nhis disdain for Goldberg known, blasting him at a press conference\nand absurdly claiming The Atlantic is “a magazine that is going\nout of business.”</p>\n\n<p>If anything, of course, publishing a story like the one Goldberg\ndid on Monday proves how strong the outlet currently is. That type\nof muscular journalism requires skill, strong leadership, and the\nbacking of a courageous publisher. I asked Goldberg about owner\nLaurene Powell Jobs’ role in the matter. He declined to comment\nspecifically on this particular story, but offered words of\npraise: “Laurene Powell Jobs is a stalwart and brave publisher at\na time when cowardice rules the day.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If it had been a Washington Post reporter who was inadvertently included on the Trump national security team’s Signal group chat, would they have run the story?
