With the chassis redesign, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus became the first iPhone models that can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/15/iphone-14-removable-back-glass/\">opened from both the front and back sides</a> of the device since the iPhone 4S in 2011. The internal redesign did not extend to the iPhone 14 Pro models, which can still only be opened from the display side, at least for authorized repairs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRemovable back glass would likely lead to significantly lower repair fees for iPhone 15 Pro models with cracked back glass for customers without AppleCare+ coverage. Apple's out-of-warranty fees for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus with back glass damage range from $169 to $199, compared to $499 to $549 for iPhone 14 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit's Kyle Wiens last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/19/ifixit-iphone-14-teardown/\">said</a> the iPhone 14 represented \"the most substantial iPhone redesign\" since the iPhone X given the increased repairability. He added that the changes were \"such a big deal that it should have been Apple's big announcementâ€”the iPhone has been redesigned from the inside out to make it easier to repair.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 15 lineup in September. Gurman reiterated that all of the devices will be equipped with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island, while he expects the Pro models to feature a titanium frame, thinner bezels around the display, a faster chip manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/ios-17-beta-action-button-iphone-15-pro/\">customizable Action button</a>, and more. He believes price increases are possible in some countries, at least for the Pro models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/30/iphone-15-pro-removable-back-glass/\">iPhone 15 Pro Said to Be 'Easier to Repair' Like iPhone 14 and 14 Plus</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-said-to-be-easier-to-repair-like-iphone-14-and-14-plus.2397278/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e31ef2c427720368e969b405cc53850579a4dc8a088354398f552223e024621","category":"Apple"}
