Those proceedings don't have the power to entirely halt the deal, as a source close to the merger proceedings <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/ftc-delays-could-send-microsoft-and-activision-back-to-the-bargaining-table/\">told Ars Technica in January</a>. By filing for a preliminary injunction, the FTC now aims to prevent the deal from going through before a July 18 deadline, potentially voiding the deal and sending the companies back to the bargaining table.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947211#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947211&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"869aee29cfa77ace9293414bd3aff26ed9b3bbf6392a3273d3d6b090706c14bf","category":"Tech"}
