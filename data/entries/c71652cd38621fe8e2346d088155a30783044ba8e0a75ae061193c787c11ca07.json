This appears to be the most specific measurement for the rumored device's display seen so far.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe next ‌iPad mini‌ has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/14/kuo-apple-glasses-2022-new-ipads-2020/\">repeatedly said</a> to feature a display in the region of eight to nine inches. The display analyst Ross Young <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/ipad-mini-6-display-design-info/\">suggested earlier this year</a> that the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ will feature a 8.3-inch display, matching this accessory listing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn 8.38-inch display would be a significant increase over the current ‌iPad mini‌'s 7.9-inch display, partly facilitated by a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">iPad Air-style design</a> with slimmer bezels and no Home Button.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-6-screen-protector-amazon-japan.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe screen protector was scheduled to go on sale on Wednesday, October 20. While the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ is expected to arrive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/sixth-generation-ipad-mini-this-fall/\">this fall</a>, there have been no more precise indications about when the updated device could launch. Some observers have speculated that it could arrive alongside <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/#whats_next_for_the_macbook_pro\">redesigned MacBook Pros</a> at an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/gurman-apple-second-event-new-macs-ipads/\">Apple event in October</a>, and the fact that this accessory was set to go on sale next month may give that claim greater credibility.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWednesday, October 20 mostly aligns with Tuesday, October 19 in the United States. Apple often hosts a special event in October to unveil new products and usually does so Tuesdays, so October 19 would not be an unreasonable guess for an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a> to launch the new ‌iPad mini‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor more on what to expect from the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6/\">see our dedicated guide</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6/\">iPad mini 6</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/ipad-mini-6-8-38-inch-display-and-october-launch/\">iPad Mini 6 May Feature 8.38-Inch Display and Launch in October</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-6-may-feature-8-38-inch-display-and-launch-in-october.2310690/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ICrdMlOU_44:5aZTyl33QyE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ICrdMlOU_44:5aZTyl33QyE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ICrdMlOU_44\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c71652cd38621fe8e2346d088155a30783044ba8e0a75ae061193c787c11ca07","category":"Apple"}
