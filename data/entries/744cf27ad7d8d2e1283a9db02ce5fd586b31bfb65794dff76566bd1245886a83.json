The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was designed for that purpose, although the physics community hoped (in vain thus far) to also discover exciting new physics.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041370#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041370&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"744cf27ad7d8d2e1283a9db02ce5fd586b31bfb65794dff76566bd1245886a83","category":"Tech"}
