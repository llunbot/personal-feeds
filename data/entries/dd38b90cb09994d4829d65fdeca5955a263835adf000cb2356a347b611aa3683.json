During the four-minute video, Intel attempted to paint Apple consumers as oblivious to \"innovations\" made by companies besides Apple, including \"touch screen\" laptops.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nContinuing its streak, yesterday, the official Intel account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intel/status/1448672444936564736?s=20\">tweeted out</a>, \"Confessions of former Mac users. What made you #GoPC?\" Instead of former Mac users engaging with the tweet on reasons they switched to PC, the tweet instead includes replies of current Mac users poking fun at Intel's \"desperate\" marketing attempts. One comment reads, \"Just admit it: you're just pissed that Apple ditched you and designed a way better processor by themselves.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><p></p><blockquote><p>(1/5) Confessions of former Mac users. What made you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoPC</a>? <br />✨ a thread ✨</p>— Intel (@intel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intel/status/1448672444936564736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <p></p></div>\r\n<br />\r\nOther replies include Apple users trolling Intel, with one stating \"You're not invited\" with a picture of the upcoming \"Unleashed\" event invitation. One reply, in Intel's defense, says that Apple is \"a low performance luxury brand with overpriced hardware and a lesser ecosystem because its closed.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIronically, while Intel goes on the defense, Apple still sells Mac computers powered by Intel processors. After Monday's \"Unleashed\" event, the higher-end MacBook Pro will no longer be Intel-based and will officially switch to Apple silicon, but other Macs such as the 27-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a> still feature Intel processors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple officially embarked on its transition to Apple silicon in November of last year, and the company is expected to fully move all of its Mac computers away from Intel next year. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/intel-tweet-for-mac-users-backfires/\">Intel Tweet Asking Why Former Mac Users Switched to PC Backfires</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/intel-tweet-asking-why-former-mac-users-switched-to-pc-backfires.2317056/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OspIJ7-uKP0:8dj2CyFENC8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OspIJ7-uKP0:8dj2CyFENC8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/OspIJ7-uKP0\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dd38b90cb09994d4829d65fdeca5955a263835adf000cb2356a347b611aa3683","category":"Apple"}
