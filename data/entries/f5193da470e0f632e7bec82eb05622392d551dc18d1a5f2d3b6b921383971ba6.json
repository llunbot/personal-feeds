The chips AMD is announcing today use up to eight Zen 4 CPU cores and RDNA 3-based integrated GPUs (either a Radeon 780M with 12 compute units, or Radeon 760M or 740M GPUs with 8 or 4 CUs). The chips are manufactured using the same 4 nm TSMC process as the 7040 series.</p>\n<p>There's also an AI-accelerating neural processing unit (NPU) that AMD claims is about 1.4 times faster than the one in the Ryzen 7040 series in large language models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/\">Llama 2</a> and <a href=\"https://onnx.ai/index.html\">ONNX</a> vision models. Both NPUs are based on the same XDNA architecture and have the same amount of processing hardware—AMD says that the AI performance improvements come mostly from higher clock speeds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989054#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989054&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f5193da470e0f632e7bec82eb05622392d551dc18d1a5f2d3b6b921383971ba6","category":"Tech"}
