The journey should be continuous in one direction and go either east to west or west to east, and the total distance travelled (including flights, ferries, etc) should exceed the length of the equator, 40,175km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do it with a full support crew in attendance, or just on your own with a credit card and a phrase book. Some people are looking to break a speed record, while others spend years taking in all the world has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how you plan to do it, one thing that every fledgling round-the-world cyclist needs is some insight into what it’s actually like. Luckily, we have four riders who have been there before, and are happy to share their experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nick Sanders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rode around the world twice in 1981 and 1985 and set the original record.

What I really appreciated about the whole trip was the simplicity of it. You don’t have any complex social relationships to deal with – you are simply on your bike finding somewhere to sleep, eat and then ride from A to B.

It’s definitely a privileged thing to do no matter what your budget is.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mark Beaumont <strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fastest person to cycle around the world supported, in 79 days</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"So you want to ride around the world?\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/ride-around-the-world-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p> ‘I’ve cycled around the world twice, unsupported when I was 23 years old, and then when I was 35 fully supported, both times for the record.
