The original plan was for it to open in 2021, but the global health crisis and economic uncertainty reportedly forced Apple to delay it. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also building a second, smaller store in the capital, New Delhi, with the possibility of further stores popping up in malls and shopping districts across India as Apple makes retail a large part of its presence in the country.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the past, CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives have remarked on the importance of India, which is home to the world's second biggest smartphone market. In 2020 Apple opened its online store in India, offering Indian customers a way to purchase products directly from Apple without having to go through an authorized premium reseller. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also been working to build out a manufacturing supply chain in the country, and in an indication of the country's perceived importance as a production hub, Apple shifted iPhone 14 assembly from China to India in the weeks following its release.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/\">Retail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/apple-bkc-retail-store-coming-soon/\">Apple BKC Retail Store in Mumbai 'Coming Soon,' Says Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-bkc-retail-store-in-mumbai-coming-soon-says-apple.2385951/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b63886af372fe05d525acfeb121f43b6741a73421dc757af9b296de52a3111b","category":"Apple"}
