Despite briefly crashing on the entry to the Orchies sector of cobbles, she fought back and broke away on pretty much the only incline on the course with 25km remaining. She soon caught Lidl-Trek’s lone leader Emma Norsgaard before riding clear on Camphin-en-Pévèle and never looking back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approaching the velodrome, Ferrand-Prévot had over a minute on the chasers. As she celebrated her victory, a butterfly took flight over her shoulder. That’s now a second cobblestone on the mantlepiece to go alongside partner Dylan van Baarle’s from 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind, EF Education-Oatly’s Letizia Borghesi broke clear of the chasing group to finish second and Lorena Wiebes just edged out Ferrand-Prévot’s Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Marianne Vos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her victory, 15-time world champion Ferrand-Prévot became the first French winner of the women’s race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following day Mathieu van der Poel rode to a third consecutive Paris-Roubaix win, becoming only the third man in history to achieve the feat and the second since Francesco Moser, who won from 1978 to 1980. After a flurry of attacks starting from just before the Arenberg – plus an untimely puncture for Mads Pedersen, Van der Poel formed a lead group alongside teammate Jasper Philipsen, who finished second to Van der Poel in both 2023 and 2024, and debutant Tadej Pogačar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly not happy to be with two Alpecin-Deceuninck riders, Pogačar turned on the afterburners and dropped Philipsen, but soon came unstuck heading into a corner too hot, leaving him needing a bike change and allowing Van der Poel to go clear for the final 38km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time the flying Dutchman approached the Vélodrome André-Pétrieux, he had amassed an advantage of over a minute – more than enough to celebrate his third cobblestone with a now-obligatory bike lift. Pogačar held on to finish second while Pedersen won the sprint for third ahead of Wout van Aert.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-1-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Misfortune</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In what was a hotly anticipated debut for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\">Pogačar</a>, he didn’t disappoint. He was constantly active near the head of the race and was the only match for Van der Poel. Yet with no elevation standing between them and the velodrome, it would’ve been a tough ask to drop the defending champion. He tried and tried at Milan-San Remo last month but couldn’t crack him on the Cipressa or the Poggio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was a question of how Pogačar could win knowing he’d likely be outsprinted if they came to the finish together. Ultimately he came into a corner too fast and came off the bike. He’d get within 15 seconds before the elastic snapped. To make matters worse, his €300k Richard Mille watch looked to have caused some bleeding on his wrist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar battled on valiantly to place second and managed to crack a smile upon reaching the velodrome. Second on your first attempt is nothing to sniff at. He’ll be back.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mathieu-van-der-poel-paris-roubaix-2025-canyon-aeroad\">Pro bike: Mathieu van der Poel’s Paris-Roubaix 2025 Canyon Aeroad</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-2025-gallery\">MVDthreePeat: The best photos from Paris-Roubaix 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-femmes-gallery-2025\">French Revolution: The best photos from Paris-Roubaix Femmes 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2025: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Fighters</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-2209284111-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Billy Ceusters/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The early breakaway in the women’s race comprised of Winspace-Orange Seal’s Aurela Nerlo and Liv-AlUla-Jayco’s Quinty Ton, who fought hard but finished 70th and 43rd. Ellen van Dijk tried the Lizzie Deignan method and got her head in the wind early after sector 16. She looked very strong over the cobbles but was ultimately reeled back in and finished 20th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotte Kopecky was animating the second half of proceedings, hoping to write her name in the history books as the first woman to complete <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-roubaix\">the Flanders-Roubaix double</a>. But it was not to be. She couldn’t make a gap stick and did a lot of work for teammate Lorena Wiebes before hitting the wall with around 3km to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Darlington Dynamo Matthew Brennan has been <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-gent-wevelgem\">having a incredible neo-pro season</a> with two impressive wins at the Volta a Catalunya and a late-call up for a debut at Paris-Roubaix. He was given the go ahead to go for his own result with team leader Wout van Aert struggling, and the 19-year-old put in an impressive performance before falling away to place 44th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last woman to finish inside the time limit was Ceratizit’s Petra Zsankó, 16 minutes down, while Oier Lazkano was the last official finisher in the men’s race, almost 22 minutes behind Van der Poel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Disruptors</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1169\" height=\"2011\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1.webp 1169w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1-174x300.webp 174w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1-564x970.webp 564w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1-768x1321.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1-893x1536.webp 893w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1-750x1290.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GoWc3_gWIAA8Xt1-1140x1961.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Cat Ferguson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Paris-Roubaix was marred by bad fan behaviour. First on the receiving end was Movistar’s Cat Ferguson, who crashed hard on sector 15. She tried to carry on but later abandoned, revealing a spectator had stepped out onto the course and into her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few weeks after being spat at during E3 Saxo Classic, Van der Poel had a bottle thrown at him on sector eight, which he later described as like being hit in the face ‘by a stone’. Fortunately he was able to stay upright and the fan has since turned himself in to Belgian police.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-high-low\">Pro Log: The highs and lows of Paris-Roubaix</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9212acd63df01619838e41b0288dcca91ef12d4efbd0763dae61b76019b126c2","category":"Cycling"}
