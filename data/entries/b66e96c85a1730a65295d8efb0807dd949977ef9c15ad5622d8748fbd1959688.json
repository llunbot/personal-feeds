As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/03/darkness-rises-in-an-age-of-light-in-first-trailer-for-star-wars-the-acolyte/\">previously reported</a>, a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the Galactic Republic and its Jedi masters symbolized the epitome of enlightenment and peace. Then came the inevitable downfall and outbreak of war as the Sith, who embraced the Dark Side of the Force, came to power. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)\"><em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em></a> will explore those final days of the Republic as the seeds of its destruction were sown.</p>\n<p>The eight-episode series was created by Leslye Headland. It's set at the end of the High Republic Era, about a century before the events of <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. Apparently Headland rather cheekily pitched <em>The Acolyte</em> as \"<em>Frozen</em> meets <em>Kill Bill</em>.\" She drew on <em>wuxia</em> martial arts films for inspiration, much like George Lucas was originally inspired by Westerns and the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa. Per the official premise:</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>In <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em>, an investigation into a shocking crime spree pits a respected Jedi Master (Lee Jung-jae) against a dangerous warrior from his past (Amandla Stenberg). As more clues emerge, they travel down a dark path where sinister forces reveal all is not what it seems…<i></i></p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to Lee (best known from<em> Squid Game</em>) and Stenberg (Rue in <em>The Hunger Games</em>), the cast includes Manny Jacinto (Jason on <em>The Good Place</em>) as a former smuggler named Qimir; Dafne Keen (<em>Logan</em>,<em> His Dark Materials</em>) as a young Jedi named Jecki Lon; Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity in <em>The Matrix</em> trilogy) as a Jedi master named Indara; Jodie Turner-Smith (<em>After Yang</em>) as Mother Aniseya, who leads a coven of witches; Rebecca Henderson (<em>Russian Doll</em>) as a Jedi knight named Vernestra Rwoh; and Charlie Bennet (<em>Russian Doll</em>) as a Jedi named Yord Fandar.</p>\n<p>In addition, Abigail Thorn plays Ensign Eurus, while Joonas Suotamo plays a Wookiee Jedi master named Kelnacca. Suotamo portrayed Chewbacca in the sequel trilogy of films (Episodes VII-IX) and in <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>. Also appearing in as-yet-undisclosed roles are Dean-Charles Chapman, Amy Tsang, and Margarita Levieva.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The first trailer dropped in March, in which we saw young padawans in training; Indara battling a mysterious masked figure; learned that somebody is out there killing Jedi; and were told that there is a growing sense of darkness. This latest trailer reinforces those themes. The assassin, Mae (Stenberg), once trained with Master Sol (Lee), and he thinks he should be the one to bring her in—although Master Vernestra correctly suspects Mae's killings are a small part a larger plan, i.e, the eventual return of the Sith.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022021#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022021&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b66e96c85a1730a65295d8efb0807dd949977ef9c15ad5622d8748fbd1959688","category":"Tech"}
