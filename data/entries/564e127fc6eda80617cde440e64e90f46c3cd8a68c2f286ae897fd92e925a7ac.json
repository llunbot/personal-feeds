That sensation may be familiar to those who bought the AirPods Pro earlier this year, then saw a USB-C version roll out alongside the iPhone 15 in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news for remorseful buyers is that the headphones themselves aren’t different; they’re still the 2nd-gen model. It’s just the case that’s been updated to replace the Lightning port with USB-C (alongside MagSafe wireless charging, as on the previous case). And better still, Apple has now–as spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/24000010/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-case-now-available&amp;xcust=1-1-2172042-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">The Verge</a>–started selling that updated case on its own, without the annoyance of another pair of AirPods Pro to clutter up your house and drain your bank account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that the case is exactly cheap. It’ll set you back $99/£89 if you buy direct from the Apple Store (where it’s available right now in the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2172042-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUYG3AM/A/magsafe-charging-case-usb%E2%80%91c-for-airpods-pro-2nd-generation\" target=\"_blank\">(U.S)</a> and <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2172042-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MUYG3ZM/A/magsafe-charging-case-usb%E2%80%91c-for-airpods-pro-2nd-generation\" target=\"_blank\">(U.K.</a>). Those who are prepared to wait a few months may find that third-party resellers discount it a little, although we’re not currently seeing much by way of savings on the wireless charging case for the standard AirPods which Apple has been selling for $79 for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of all this, incidentally, is classic Apple. For the first three months of its life the USB-C case was available only as a bundle with the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro, to maximize revenue from early adopters; now that the holiday sales rush is largely over, it’s time to give the product a boost by unveiling the cheaper deal. Much like the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1532375/yellow-iphone-color-launch-spring-holding-back.html\">annoying strategy</a> of waiting six months before launching a new color for the latest-generation iPhones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next year we hope to see some actual new AirPods, from the long-awaited 2nd-gen AirPods Max to the widely rumored AirPods Lite.
