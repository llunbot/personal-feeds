Apple has also released a macOS Big Sur 11.6.2 update for those still running macOS Big Sur. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1 adds a major missing feature to the Mac -- SharePlay. With SharePlay, Mac owners can watch TV, listen to music, and play games with friends and family members over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsing SharePlay, all kinds of apps integrate with ‌FaceTime‌, and content is synced for all people who are part of the ‌FaceTime‌ call. You can listen to music and access shared playlists using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, watch synced TV shows and movies together with the TV app, work out together with Apple Fitness+, and even share your screen with friends and family members for things like group trip planning or device troubleshooting.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay was designed to work with first-party apps like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> and ‌Apple Music‌, but Apple designed an API for developers so third-party apps can also use ‌FaceTime‌ for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/25/ios-15-1-shareplay-third-party-apps/\">shared games and other experiences</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1 brings support for the $4.99 ‌Apple Music‌ Voice Plan that's designed to work with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and it adds Communication Safety for children in the Messages app. There are updates to the Memories feature in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> to bring macOS 12 in line with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, and the update includes the same Digital Legacy feature being introduced in iOS 15.2. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDigital Legacy lets you designate a person as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/legacy-contact/\">Legacy Contact</a> to give them access to your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> account when you die. Apple has also added Hide My Email support for the Mail app, a Store tab in the TV app, and bug fixes for the trackpad, HDR video playback on YouTube, charging, and notch display issues.
