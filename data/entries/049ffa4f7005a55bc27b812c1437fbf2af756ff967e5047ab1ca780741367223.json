But the gaming service's arrival on modern LG televisions late Tuesday is still fascinating, mostly because of how neatly and seamlessly it works. The results make me wonder how much better <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/\">the Stadia story</a> might have turned out if app support like this had been in place from the start.</p>\n<h2>Got any extra-long USB cables lying around?</h2>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/google-stadia-might-be-gamings-future-but-in-the-present-it-looks-rough/\">its limited November 2019 launch</a>, Google's Stadia service has been added to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9578631?hl=en\">many platforms</a>, including laptops and desktops, Android and iOS devices, and Google TV-branded streaming devices. But smart TV support has been scattershot, with popular device families like Amazon Fire, Roku, and Apple TV missing out on Stadia. There has also been a lack of built-in smart TV support from major manufacturers like Samsung and LG. (It's worth noting that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/amazons-luna-game-streaming-service-adds-3-for-family-free-with-prime-tiers/\">Amazon Luna</a> and Apple Arcade compete as subscription-based gaming services.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818828#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818828&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"049ffa4f7005a55bc27b812c1437fbf2af756ff967e5047ab1ca780741367223","category":"Tech"}
