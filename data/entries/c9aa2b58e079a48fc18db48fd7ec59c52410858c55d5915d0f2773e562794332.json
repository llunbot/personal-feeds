But what they really kept coming back for was that custom <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/custom-chrome-good-looks-for-modern-battaglin-portofino-premium-lugged-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Cromovelato</a> finish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This unique multi-step finishing process involves mirror polishing raw steel frame tubes, then brazing/welding a frame, then re-polishing the complete frame, then chrome-plating the entire frame. Then, more polishing, then adding a translucent layer of tinted colored paint on top, and polishing some more. The result is a colored chrome Cromovelato finish with a shininess and depth that’s hard to understand until you see it. Then, Battaglin tops it off with handpainted logos, details, and a final clearcoat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a laborious process, but one that Battaglin has perfected over the last 4 decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Officina Battaglin Grand Tour custom Italian steel endurance road bike in shiny cromovelato, stages\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Officina-Battaglin-high-polish-colored-chrome-cromovelato-finish_steps.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now by offering the <em>Cromovelato For You</em> program, Battaglin can produce the stock size frames in their workshop in Marostica, Italy in small production batches. Then, finish them all to the ‘raw’ chrome stage. And then, each frame waits for the final color choice and final detail painting to suit the buyer. You get an individually custom-finished steel bike, 100% made-in-Italy. All at a lower price than full custom, and delivered in weeks, not months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Battaglin Palladio, new <em>Cromovelato For You</em> steel road bike </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Battaglin Palladio, new Cromovelato For You steel road bike , outside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Battaglin-Cromovelato-For-You_custom-finished-Italian-steel-bike_new-Palladio-steel-road-bike_outside.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(All other photos/Battaglin)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fast-custom road bike is a new lugged steel Palladio model developed based on Battaglin’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/battaglin-portofino-r-modern-custom-lugged-steel-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Portofino R</a>.
