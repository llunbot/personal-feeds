That's according to the leaker Majin Bu.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iphone-17-pro-majin-bu-sky-blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /><div><em>Concept mockup from Majin Bu</em></div>\r<br />\nWriting on his <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/the-new-iphone-17-pro-color/\">website</a>, Bu claims that \"sources close to the supply chain confirm that several iPhone 17 Pro prototypes have been made in various colors, with Sky Blue currently the frontrunner.\" Bu goes on to say that it \"looks even more stunning than the much-loved Sierra Blue of the iPhone 13 Pro, with a brightness and refinement that make it irresistible.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Sky Blue finish on the MacBook Air is not very saturated, and the color's appearance can vary based on lighting conditions. Apple describes it as \"a beautiful, metallic light blue that creates a dynamic gradient when light reflects off of its surface.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has stuck to muted colors for its recent iPhone \"Pro\" models made from titanium, and it offered a new Desert Titanium color for the iPhone 16 Pro, which also comes in Natural Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMajin Bu accurately <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/\">revealed</a> the \"Desert Titanium\" color name for iPhone 16 Pro models seven months before the devices launched. However, some of his information has been wrong, including a rumor about an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/leaker-claims-low-cost-ipad-launching-tomorrow/\">iPad 11 being imminent in 2023</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" /><div><em>MacBook Air in Sky Blue</em></div>\r<br />\nThis is the first rumor about iPhone 17 colors that we've covered.
