The pre-ordering issues have also resulted in some customers missing out on securing their preferred iPhone 13 configuration for launch day delivery on September 24, as delivery estimates have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/iphone-13-preorders-already-slipping/\">already started slipping into October</a> for some models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> Apple has since acknowledged the issues <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\">on its system status page</a>, noting that \"some Apple Card customers are not able to make iPhone Upgrade Program purchases.\" Apple said it will update the page when the issue is resolved.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Citizens One not taking Apple Card was not on my Bingo card for this year‚Äôs iPhone cycle.</p>‚Äî Craig Hockenberry (@chockenberry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/1438842581035585541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>The funniest thing about Apple not accepting Apple Card for payment of the Apple iPhone, is that the receipt will no doubt say ‚Äúyou could have earned 3% back if you‚Äôd used Apple Card to pay for this‚Äù <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhonePreOrder?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iPhonePreOrder</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CXsnlSnjF8\">pic.twitter.com/CXsnlSnjF8</a></p>‚Äî Dave Wood üá®üá¶ (@DaveWoodX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaveWoodX/status/1438843618475790339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Well this was fun. üòë<br /><br />For anyone trying to order the iPhone 13 using an Apple Card, try switching to a muggle card, instead.
