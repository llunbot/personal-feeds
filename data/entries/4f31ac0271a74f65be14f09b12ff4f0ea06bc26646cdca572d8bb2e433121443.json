No company benefited more than fellow Big Tech giant Apple—which US District Judge Amit Mehta called a “crucial partner” to Google.</p>\n<p>During a weekslong trial, Apple executives showed up to explain and defend the partnership. Under a deal that first took shape in 2002, Google paid a cut of search advertising revenue to Apple to direct its users to Google Search as default, with payments reaching $20 billion for 2022, according to the court’s findings. In exchange, Google got access to Apple’s valuable user base—more than half of all search queries in the US currently flow through Apple devices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041480#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041480&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4f31ac0271a74f65be14f09b12ff4f0ea06bc26646cdca572d8bb2e433121443","category":"Tech"}
