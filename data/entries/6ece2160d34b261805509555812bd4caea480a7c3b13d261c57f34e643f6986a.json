power meter crankset\" title=\"Rotor 2INpower SL\" />                                            <p>Rotor has announced the 2INpower SL, a “superlight” version of its existing dual-sided crank-based power meter.</p>\n<p>The Rotor 2INpower SL is built around a CNC-machined aluminium crankset, and weighs a claimed 530g in a 170mm length.</p>\n<p>The 2INpower SL crankset can be paired with 1x or 2x direct-mount chainrings, or a 110mm x 4 BCD (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">Bolt Circle Diameter</a>) chainring spider for use with standard chainrings.</p>\n<p>The 2INpower SL <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meter</a> has a claimed accuracy rating of +/- 1.5 per cent, and is priced at £860/€999/$1,099 – £110/€50/$56 cheaper than the previous version.</p>\n<p>Rotor says it offers a “best in class” option for dedicated cyclists, or for those who wish to improve their pedalling symmetry and efficiency.</p>\n<h2>The lightest dual-sided power meter</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor 2INpower SL power meter crankset\" title=\"Rotor 2INpower SL\"

number of INpower cranksets in recent years, including <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/rotor-inpower-review/\">single-sided options</a> and an MTB-specific dual-sided version, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/cranksets/rotor-2inpower-mtb-power-meter-review/\">Rotor 2INpower MTB</a>.</p>\n<p>At a claimed 530g for a 170mm crankset, the new 2INpower SL appears to save 66g versus the existing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rotor-releases-new-2inpower-power-meter/\">2INpower DM Road</a> (claimed weight 596g), the standard dual-sided version for road and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Rotor says this represents a 15 per cent weight saving (although by our calculations it’s more like 11 per cent).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor 2INpower SL power meter crankset\" title=\"Rotor 2INpower SL\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2INpower SL can be used with 1x or 2x drivetrains on both road and gravel bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rotor</i></span></div>\n<p>This weight accounts for each crank arm and the integrated 30mm aluminium axle.</p>\n<p>With Rotor’s own 50/34t chainrings, the total system weight rises to a claimed 729g.</p>\n<p>In comparison, a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9200-review/\">Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200</a> power meter crankset (172.5mm cranks, with 52/36t chainrings) weighs 750g.</p>\n<h2>Independent left/right measurement</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor 2INpower SL power meter crankset\" title=\"Rotor 2INpower SL\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Each crank arm contains a separate power meter.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rotor</i></span></div>\n<p>As with other dual-sided power meter cranksets and pedal systems, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/stages-power-lr-shimano-ultegra-r8000-review/\">Stages LR</a>, <a

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/favero-assioma-duo-power-meter-pedals-review/\">Favero Assioma Duo</a>, the Rotor 2INpower SL offers true (as opposed to estimated) left/right power measurement.</p>\n<p>This is because each crank arm or pedal can measure the power produced by each leg independently.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor 2INpower SL power meter crankset\" title=\"Rotor 2INpower SL\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rotor says the 2INpower SL is ideal for riders looking to improve their pedalling efficiency.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rotor</i></span></div>\n<p>In contrast, spider-based power meters, such as the <a

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/power2max-ng-road-review/\">Power2Max NG Road</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rotor-inspider-power-meter/\">Rotor’s own INspider</a>, measure power between the chainrings and the cranks.</p>\n<p>This means that while they measure total power (i.e. that produced by both legs), they can only provide an estimated left/right-leg split.</p>\n<p>Though the usefulness of such data to the average rider is still contested by some, if you do want an accurate left/right split then a dual-sided power meter is the way to go.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor 2INpower SL power meter crankset\" title=\"Rotor 2INpower SL\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Rotor Power app can be

Android smart devices) can be used for in-depth pedalling analysis and to optimise the rotation of its Q-rings.</p>\n<p>Q-rings are the Spanish brand’s ovalised chainrings, which are claimed to improve pedalling efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Rotor 2INpower SL pricing, details and specification</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rotor 2INpower SL power meter crankset\"
