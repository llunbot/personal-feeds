But Apple now has several different models in stock in refurbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which iMac Pro should you buy</strong>? Apple has a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FQ2Y2LL/A/Refurbished-27-inch-iMac-Pro-32GHz-8-core-Intel-Xeon-W-with-Retina-5K-display&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-0-0-0\">Refurbished 27-inch iMac Pro 3.2GHz 8-core Intel Xeon W with Retina 5K display</a> for $3,819, a savings of $680.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/imac-pro&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-0-0-0\">Go to the Apple Certified Refurbished store to see all of the available iMac Pros for sale.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refurbished Mac Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/mac-pro-2019-05-100798475-orig.jpg\"><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/mac-pro-2019-05-100798475-medium.jpg\" /></a></figure></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Pro is a pricey machine, so going with a refurb is a way to save some cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which Mac Pro should you buy? </strong>For a brand new Mac Pro, Apple doesn’t offer standard configurations; it’s a machine you customize to your preferences. Since a refurbished Mac is a machine that a customer returned, all the Mac Pros in Apple’s refurbished inventory are ones that a customer designed. You can’t customize a refurb, so you basically have to pick what’s on the shelf. If you really want a refurb Mac Pro, you may have to settle for a model that doesn’t quite fit the specifications you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, big savings could be had. For example, Apple is selling a Refurbished Mac Pro 3.5GHz 8-core Intel Xeon W, 8GB Radeon Pro 580X, 48GB of memory, and an 8TB SSD for $7,559. A new version of that model sells for $8,899, so you save $1.340.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-0-0-0\">Go to the Apple Certified Refurbished store to see all of the available Mac Pros for sale.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refurbished Apple TV</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/apple-tv-100741667-small.jpg\" /></figure></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through periods of being unavailable, Apple has inventory of its Apple TV in stock. Keep in mind that these are older models and does not include the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343779/the-new-apple-tv-4k-is-all-about-the-redesigned-siri-remote.html\">Apple TV 4K announced during the April Spring Loaded event</a>. In fact, these models have the old Siri remote and the savings isn’t much, so consider buying a new model with the new remote—it’s worth it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Apple is offering these models at the time of this writing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>R<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FQD22LL/A/Refurbished-Apple-TV-4K-32GB&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-0-0-0\">efurbished Apple TV 4K (32GB)</a> for $149</li><li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FP7P2LL/A/Refurbished-Apple-TV-4K-64GB&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-0-0-0\">Refurbished Apple TV 4K (64GB)</a> for $169</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/appletv&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-0-0-0\">Go to the Apple Certified Refurbished store to see all of the available Apple TVs for sale.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refurbished HomePod</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, Apple does not have any refurbished models in stock.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0a4df24cf62ad1c0fab94184fa31ab116a412e09a443ccf67b938c517801268e","category":"Apple"}
