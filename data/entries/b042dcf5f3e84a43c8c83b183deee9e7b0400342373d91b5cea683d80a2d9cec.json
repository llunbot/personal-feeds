Made to go anywhere and do anything, it’s as suited to back-country epics as it is bike park blasts. A handbuilt, zingy steel frame makes light work of rough and rowdy descents whilst mullet wheels bring that perfect balance of flick-knife and magnum. With room for a 120mm to 160mm fork, you’ve got plenty of options to custom build your own perfect setup. It’s not a spindly XC whippet, it’s not a sickly ‘hardcore ‘hardtail. It’s a ride-wherever, ride-whatever, tough-as-nails stainless do-it-all that’s built to take on whatever you can throw it at. And, of course, it’s built-in beautiful stainless steel for that shiny, rust-free raw style.</p>\n<p>When you’re done with the video above, check out more photos of the Roost below and check out the pre-order at <a href=\"https://www.starlingcycles.com/bikes/roost-hardtail/\" target=\"_blank\">Starling Cycles</a>. <em>Pre-orders are open now with frames shipping to customers in early April 2022.</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/Starling-5777-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_8600.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/IMG_8598.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/Starling-5799-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/Starling-5795-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/Starling-5806-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/Starling-5813-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/Starling-5822-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/Starling-5859-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/12/the-starling-cycles-roost-hardtail/\">The Starling Cycles Roost Hardtail</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b042dcf5f3e84a43c8c83b183deee9e7b0400342373d91b5cea683d80a2d9cec","category":"Cycling"}
