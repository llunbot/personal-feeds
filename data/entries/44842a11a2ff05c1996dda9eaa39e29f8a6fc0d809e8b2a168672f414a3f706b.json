Like Apple, Google has delayed a return to work until mid-October.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple initially planned to have employees return to work <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-employees-returning-to-work/\">for three days a week</a> starting in September, but earlier this month, the company announced that it would not ask employees to return until \"at least October.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple and Google have delayed office returns due to the prevalence of the Delta variant, which is more transmissible than original COVID-19 strains and has led to surging infection rates across the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen employees are required to return to Apple campuses, Apple says it will give at least a month's notice.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's return to work plan has been unpopular with some employees who have grown accustomed to working remotely and who have discovered that much of their jobs can be done from home. Many tech companies plan to allow employees to continue to work remotely on a permanent basis, but Apple is eager to get employees back to the office and has argued that in-person collaboration is essential to its culture and to future product development.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19 Coronavirus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/28/apple-considering-vaccine-requirement-for-employees/\">Apple Considering Vaccination Requirement for Employees Returning to Offices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CpEhBuGSgZM:sCSyK-CFs9c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CpEhBuGSgZM:sCSyK-CFs9c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CpEhBuGSgZM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"44842a11a2ff05c1996dda9eaa39e29f8a6fc0d809e8b2a168672f414a3f706b","category":"Apple"}
