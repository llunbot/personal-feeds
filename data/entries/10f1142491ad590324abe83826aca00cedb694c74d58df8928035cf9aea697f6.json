I’ve been a fan of Reilly’s writing since I was a teenager and he was the back-page columnist for Sports Illustrated; this is was <em>the</em> book Reilly was born to write. I just picked my copy off my shelf and started to re-read it, and got sucked right back in. Posting this link is my way of forcing myself to put it down until tonight.</p>\n\n<p>(Main link here is an Amazon affiliate one, which will make me rich if you purchase through it.
