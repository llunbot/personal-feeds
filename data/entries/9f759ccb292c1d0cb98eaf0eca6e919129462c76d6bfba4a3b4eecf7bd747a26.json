I like to think the message was intended for me, too, because today, my beloved low-cost wireless carrier, Mint Mobile, packed up its ironic communications style, its celebrity ownership, and its $15/month plans... and agreed to sell them all to T-Mobile for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-15/t-mobile-buys-mint-mobile-for-1-35-billion-keeping-ryan-reynolds-spokesman?leadSource=uverify%20wall\">$1.35 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>Good for actor Ryan Reynolds, part-owner of Mint Mobile. As Reynolds <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-backed-mint-mobile-143815373.html%20\">said in a statement</a>, \"We are so happy T-Mobile beat out an aggressive last-minute bid from my mom Tammy Reynolds as we believe the excellence of their 5G network will provide a better strategic fit than my mom’s slightly-above-average mahjong skills.\" (Ha-ha!) Reynolds also released the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i5-sGiWr-M\">funniest acquisition video</a> I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>Still, the news is depressing. Mint felt fresh; it was a wireless carrier with a slick website and app that worked (at least for me) simply and seamlessly, an irreverent and straight-talking style (Reynolds sent out <a href=\"https://comicbook.com/irl/news/ryan-reynolds-mint-mobile-sending-subscribers-christmas-cards-surprise/\">temp tattoos of his face</a> to subscribers for Christmas; they said, \"No Ragrets\"), and great prices. It all Just Worked<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" />. Now, I love a good value, but not at the cost of janky service, constant hiccups, and 2000-era websites like I saw at other cheap mobile providers. And it wasn't just me; Mint racked up many recommendations, including the \"best budget\" wireless option from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-carrier/\">Wirecutter</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924196#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924196&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f759ccb292c1d0cb98eaf0eca6e919129462c76d6bfba4a3b4eecf7bd747a26","category":"Tech"}
