Their new Flip Your Fork program is a trade-in deal that lets riders offload their current gravel fork in exchange for a $250 credit toward a brand-new Invert. But there’s a catch—<em><strong>only the first 250 riders in the U.S. and Canada get in on the action.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-details-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-details-10.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of cane creek invert upside down gravel suspension fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-details-10.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-details-10-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-details-10-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-details-10-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-details-10-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s the Big Deal About the Invert?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cane Creek shook up the gravel scene a year ago when they introduced the Invert, calling it the ‘World’s First Gravel Fork’—a bold claim that raised more than a few eyebrows. But here’s why they (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cane-creek-invert-review/\">and our review here</a>) stand by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-riding-action-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-riding-action-7.jpg\" alt=\"cane creek invert gravel bike suspension fork being ridden\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-riding-action-7.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-riding-action-7-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-riding-action-7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-riding-action-7-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-riding-action-7-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smooth &amp; Controlled Ride – </strong>Designed to soak up chatter and keep things stable on loose terrain, the Invert makes gravel riding more comfortable and fun. Plus, it’s adjustable for different rider weights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lightest in Class – </strong>Cane Creek says the Invert is the lightest adjustable suspension fork on the market, meaning you get compliance without the weight penalty.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Blends Right In – </strong>No awkward MTB-derived shapes here. The Invert was made to look right at home on a drop-bar bike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Set It &amp; Forget It –</strong> No complex setup, no suspension wizardry required. With double the service interval of a standard MTB fork, the Invert is built for more miles and less maintenance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2.jpg\" alt=\"prototype test forks for cane creek gravel suspension fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cane-creek-invert-prototypes-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Left to Right: The Invert progressed from a shrunken Helm to a fine-tuned gravel fork.
