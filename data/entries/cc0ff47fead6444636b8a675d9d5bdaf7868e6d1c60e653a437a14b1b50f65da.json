Stan’s (one of the OGs in tubeless sealant technology) has updated their unique <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stans-dart-fires-unique-feathered-plug-to-better-seal-tubeless-tire-punctures-for-good/\">DART system,</a> this time working alongside <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/daysaver-incredible-pump-kickstarter/\">Daysaver</a> to help store and keep the updated tool lasting longer and performing consistently. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART tool along\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-along--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Stan’s Incredible DART?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The DART is a plug-style tubeless flat tool that uses a unique blow-dart-style insert to fill cuts in the tire carcass. The flexible nature and flower-style design of the DART plug allow it to fit nicely into large and small tire cuts and cover more space. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s New? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stan’s Incredible DART builds on the base design launched some years ago. There was never a great storage solution for the DART; you mostly had to store it in your jersey pocket, but it wasn’t a burden – it was just easy to forget (or lose, in my case). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART tool tall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tool-tall--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Incredible DART design focuses on elegant storage and ease of use. Stan’s partnered with the engineers at Daysaver in Switzerland to create this sleek, updated design that will be much harder to forget.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART fitting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How Does the Stan’s Incredible DART Install? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Incredible DART can be installed inside a handlebar (with Stan’s Incredible Handlebar Mount, sold separately) or stored in a pocket or backpack like the OG DART. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART packaging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-packaging--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stan’s supplies three different grommets with the Incredible DART handlebar kit, and they should fit most flat bars. To install the Stan’s Incredible DART on your bars, all you need to do is install the grommet on the tool (opposite the side of the Stan’s logo) and slide the tool onto the bar end clip. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART how to install\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-how-to-install--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Install the correct grommet for your size bar</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Loosen the plug at the end of the quick release fitting to slide into the bars</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART tighten\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-tighten--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Tighten the 3mm fitting with the release engaged</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, tighten the 3mm fitting while the quick release is engaged and secure the fit. To use the tool, flip the quick release, and the tool will slide out when you pull the tab. Then, you’re ready to fix a flat.  Also – the new Stan’s DART works with any of Daysaver’s modular Incredible tool ecosystems. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART closed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closed--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How Do You Use the Stan’s Incredible DART? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re familiar with tire plugs or bacon strip-style repairs, the Stan’s Incredible DART works nearly the same. You take the tool out of your bar end (or your pocket) and twist the tool while holding the silver alloy piece. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twisting will pop the spring-loaded DART installation bit and DART plug from their hidden home in the tool. Mind how quickly you turn the preloaded tool—I’ve had the DART plug fling off into the installation tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART using\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-using--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then locate your flat, and push the Stan’s Incredible DART plug into the puncture. The installation tool has a bottom-out feature that only allows the plug to be installed at a certain depth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you successfully install the DART plug, spin the wheel and flood the puncture site with the tubeless sealant in your tires (Stan’s or not). After this, you should be ready to inflate and roll. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART more darts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-more-darts--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you unfortunately get another flat (we’ve all been there), the new Incredible DART holds three DART plugs. So you should be good to get home or at least go to a corner store. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART all installe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-all-installe--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions: Stan’s Incredible DART</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a fan of the current Stan’s DART, it’s easy to use and fits in my flat kit. My only complaint is that it takes up more space than the bacon strips or slim Dyna Plug tool. It seems that the updated Stan’s Incredible DART has solved most of those problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The installation installation is easy enough, and the tool is well-designed. I like how resilient the design is. The alloy outer looks like it will last the long haul, and the tool doesn’t rattle in your bars, thanks to the various-sized grommets in the hardware kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART fitting for install\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-fitting-for-install--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>A No-Go For Most Road </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was bummed to see that it wouldn’t work in any of my drop bar bikes. There is a minimal chance it could work with gravel bars that are very flared, but that’s wishful thinking. As I imagine, this is a flat bar-only install tool. BUT its slimmer and cylindrical design is better for packing and storing quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated tool design is a nice improvement and upgrade from the current model. The spring-loaded piece is a bit novel, and it’s not just for show; it works, and that’s all that matters. Just don’t spring your DART plug into the woods.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-closeup--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Premium Price for Premium Tools </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost is significantly higher than that of the original model. The Stan’s DART tool (OG) is $25.00, with refills being $20.00. The new Stan’s Incredible DART is $72.00, and an extra $35.00 if you want the hardware kit. That means getting the whole kit (hardware for the bar installation) will cost $107.00.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Why the price increase?</em></strong> The OG DART is crafted out of plastic and is slightly less refined. The new Stan’s Incredible DART feels like a tool that you can get more use out of, one that will last a long time — primarily because of its alloy construction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Is it worth the extra cost? </em></strong>I would say yes – especially if you’re a <a href=\"https://stans.com/collections/tools\">Stan’s DART fan</a>. The tool fits seamlessly into the bars of most flat-bar bikes (it fits all of mine, but I don’t want to say it fits them all). Plus, the tool design is cool, and I like cool, neat tools, especially practical ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART full tool weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-full-tool-weight--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Stan’s Incredible DART weight with hardware</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Stans Incredible DART only the DART\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stans-Incredible-DART-only-the-DART--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Stan’s Incredible DART just the tool</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What about the weight? </em></strong>The original Stan’s DART weighs 15g with two DART plugs in the chamber.
