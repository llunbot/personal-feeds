There is a further need for a headphone case that can also convey information to a user, through haptics and/or display devices. Such methods and interfaces optionally complement conventional methods for controlling wireless headphones. Such methods and interfaces reduce the number, extent, and/or nature of the inputs from a user and produce a more efficient human-machine interface. </blockquote>In one embodiment, Apple envisions controlling Apple Music via the case through the use of a capacitive touchscreen with a GUI that also provides tactile feedback, allowing the user to control audio playback, adjust volume, favorite songs, and interact with their music in other ways without necessarily looking at the case to do so.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/airpods-case-with-display-.jpg\" alt width=\"2038\" height=\"1222\" />\r<br />\nIn another embodiment, the case responds to specific gestures such as taps and swipes to navigate onscreen content and invoke Siri. In one scenario, Apple describes how squeezing the case could even be a way to change the listening mode of the AirPods â€“ likely referring to Noise Cancelation and Transparency. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple suggests that the case could include additional processors and memory modules that would allow it to carry out specific instructions that are traditionally associated with smartphones, computers, and other connected devices. For instance, some embodiments show the case's touchscreen providing interactive access to iPhone apps including Phone, Mail, Messages, Camera, Calendar, Weather, Maps, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBy integrating an interactive touchscreen display in such a way, the patent argues, \"deficiencies associated with user control of wireless headphones are reduced or eliminated.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/airpods-case-touchscreen-music.jpg\" alt width=\"1906\" height=\"1272\" />\r<br />\nAs with any filed patent, the technology it describes is unlikely to appear in a product anytime soon, if at all, but it does offer an interesting look at how Apple is exploring ways to make an AirPods case more of a functional intermediary between the AirPods themselves and the connected audio source.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the first AirPods launched in 2016, Apple has worked to enhance the functionality of the AirPods Case for different models. The AirPods Pro case in particular has benefited from the addition of MagSafe wireless charging, a U1 Ultra Wideband chip that supports Precision Tracking with Find My, a lanyard loop, a built-in speaker for locating and status updates, and increased battery life.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/03/apple-invents-an-airpods-case-with-a-frontside-touch-display-allowing-users-to-interact-with-apps-for-music-apple-tv-maps.html\">Patently Apple</a>.)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/\">Patent</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/apple-airpods-case-with-touchscreen/\">Apple Researching AirPods Case With Built-in Interactive Touchscreen</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-researching-airpods-case-with-built-in-interactive-touchscreen.2385760/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"668b0fd3d260e0979e2dc10d57b51e5e0f300b5dee7d0982e3c183307672e25e","category":"Apple"}
