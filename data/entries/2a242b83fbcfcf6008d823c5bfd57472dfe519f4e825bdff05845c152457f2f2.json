There was nothing objectively wrong with the bike, but my road riding was incorporating more and more dirt and poorly paved roads which just didn’t suit the 25 mm tyre limit of the Cannondale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My preference was for a metal frame, probably aluminium, perhaps with rim brakes, but definitely something that took at least 32 mm tyres. I wanted something metal because I’d bought a Mason Bokeh gravel bike a few years earlier and really loved the lively road feel and durability of it. I also didn’t want to spend a fortune on a “forever” bike; I wanted something I wouldn’t hesitate to take down a dirt road in the rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0363-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Struggling with the options available, I turned to the most reliable source of bike information I knew: the Nerd Alert Podcast. After making a submission to the ‘bike selector’ segment, in February 2020, James, Dave, Caley, and Zach discussed my conundrum in detail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my submission, I told the team I wanted something “stiff, lightweight, and timeless”. As intended, they interpreted “timeless” as a preference for the traditional horizontal top tube and a desire for something that will stand the test of time; no custom handlebars and no unique bottom bracket standard. There were some great ideas: Vinyl Road, CAAD13, Emonda, Spooky, and while a little out of budget, James’ suggestion was for a custom bike from Low Bicycles, an aluminium specialist in San Francisco. So, armed with this advice, I created an extensive spreadsheet and I started to weigh it all up.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0311-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up calling Andrew Low on a whim one day and, as if by divine intervention, he told me about his newly minted “Low Key” line of frames. By cutting out complex tube shaping and fillet welds, Andrew had developed a simpler construction technique that allowed him to build bikes for more than US$1,000 less than his flagship models. Better still, he even had an “all road” version which fits a 38 mm tyre. While disc-only, it was a compromise I was willing to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0343-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after many long hours of deliberation, the final decision felt impulsive. Late one night I put in my order, paid the deposit, and made a rushed decision on the decal paint colour. And then the long wait began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame ended up taking seven months to arrive, which gave me time to sell my old bike in the midst of the pandemic price boom and to decide what I was going to put on my new frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0328-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the groupset, I liked the idea of wireless but SRAM Red was going to blow my (already blown) budget and Force was just too … plasticy. Thankfully, the wise cats at Bike Gallery in Melbourne had developed a solution of putting the much more attractive Red chainring on the Force groupset. As my mum would say, “mutton dressed as lamb”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0238-2-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My original idea for the wheels was Zipp 303 Ss, but on the day I collected the bike I decided to swap them out for Firecrests which are extravagant and unnecessary but totally amazing to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0321-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months in, there isn’t much I’d change if I was to start again. However, while I do really enjoy the exorbitant wheelset, I’m not totally convinced by the wireless Force AXS. Given the weight penalty and the huge price jump, I’m not sure the accuracy and ease of maintenance is there to justify it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0239-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessing the end result, I’m the first to admit the bike is a long way from the original spec for something under AU$5,000 and with rim brakes, but it rides like a dream. It’s more comfortable and stable than my old Cannondale, but not to the same extreme as a gravel bike. It’s also somehow more engaging, which I guess is what I was chasing in the aluminium frame, and I’ve certainly not hesitated to ride it in the rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0278-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Andrew for making such a gorgeous frame, Bike Gallery for the build, and to James Huang for the suggestion in the first place!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build spec</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frame:</strong> Low Bicycles, LK All-road<br /><strong>Fork:</strong> Enve All Road<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Force AXS<br /><strong>Shifter:</strong>  SRAM Force AXS<br /><strong>Front and rear derailleur:</strong>  SRAM Force AXS<br /><strong>Crankset:</strong> SRAM Force AXS<br /><strong>Bottom bracket: </strong>SRAM DUB BB English 68/73<br /><strong>Chainring: </strong>SRAM Red 48-35T<br /><strong>Cassette: </strong>SRAM Force 10-33T<br /><strong>Wheels:</strong> Zipp 303 Firecrest<br /><strong>Tyres:</strong> Schwalbe G-One Speed 35 mm<br /><strong>Handlebars:</strong> Zipp SL70 Ergo 42 cm<br /><strong>Stem:</strong> Zipp SL Speed 100 mm 6º<br /><strong>Seatpost:</strong> Zipp SL Speed 0-Offset<br /><strong>Saddle:</strong> Specialized Power Arc Pro<br /><strong>Bottle cages:</strong> Silca Ti<br /><strong>Computer mount: </strong>Zipp SL</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0221-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0235-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0257-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0270-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0274-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0276-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0279-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0292-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0325-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0293-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0303-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0306-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0322-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0312-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0318-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0316-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0335-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0342-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0347-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0349-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0354-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0356-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0231-1340x894.jpg\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/bikes-of-the-bunch-low-bicycles-lk-all-road/\">Read More</a>","author":"Jono Mitchell","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2a242b83fbcfcf6008d823c5bfd57472dfe519f4e825bdff05845c152457f2f2","category":"Cycling"}
