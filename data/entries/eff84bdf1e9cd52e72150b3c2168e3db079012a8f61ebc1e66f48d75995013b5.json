We expected the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">iOS 18 beta</a> to continue through the summer until its release in September, followed immediately by the iOS 18.1 beta. Then, iOS 18.1 would be released in October, and 18.2 beta testing would begin, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year is very different. More than a month ahead of the expected iOS 18 release, Apple began an iOS 18.1 beta test. It was made available for developers way back on July 29, and is now finally available for all iPhones, bringing the first Apple Intelligence features for compatible models—the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">superguide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Updated October 28:</strong> <em>iOS 18.1 has arrived for all iPhones. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.1: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s biggest iOS 18 feature is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>, a suite of AI tools and Siri enhancements that will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as later iPhones.
