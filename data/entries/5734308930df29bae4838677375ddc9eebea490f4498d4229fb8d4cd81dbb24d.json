{"title":"Apple Watch Series 7 Supports 60.5GHz Wireless Data Transfer, Perhaps Only for Apple’s Internal Use","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-watch-60-5-ghz-wireless-data-transfer/","date":1632435188000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Watch Series 7 models are equipped with a new module that\nenables 60.5GHz wireless data transfer, according to <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/527108597/Apple-Watch-Series-7-FCC-Filing\">FCC\nfilings</a> viewed by MacRumors, but this functionality may be\nreserved for Apple’s internal use only for now.</p>\n\n<p>The filings indicate that the 60.5GHz module is only activated\nwhen the Apple Watch is placed on a proprietary magnetic dock with\na corresponding 60.5GHz module, but this dock will likely be\nreserved for use by Apple employees. For example, it’s possible\nthat Apple Stores might use the dock to wirelessly restore an\nApple Watch, and if so, it will be interesting to see if Series 7\nmodels still have a hidden diagnostic port for wired connectivity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a little interesting in and of itself. But if you look at the long-term trend, it’s a sign that Apple — along with the rest of the industry — is moving toward wireless technology for both charging <em>and</em> data transfer. Apple Watch exemplifies that — it’s <em>never</em> had a port, either for charging or data. There’s a diagnostic port hidden inside the bottom channel for the watch strap, but those <em>diagnostics</em> are neither charging nor data.</p>\n\n<p>It’s long been my guess that iPhone is never going to support USB-C. I think it’s Apple’s intention to go straight from Lightning to wireless/inductive, with no “port”. Portless is the future for all devices. Yet the product design geniuses at the European Commission want to mandate all devices have one specific port in 2024 and indefinitely thereafter — a port that by that time <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C\">will already be 10 years old</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/23/series-7-wireless-data-transfer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5734308930df29bae4838677375ddc9eebea490f4498d4229fb8d4cd81dbb24d","category":"Tech"}
