{"title":"AWS Contact Center Day – July 2021","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-contact-center-day-july-2021/","date":1626881148000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/07/12/AdobeStock_239398209.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/07/12/AdobeStock_239398209.jpeg\" /></a></p> \n<p>Earlier this week, I ordered from Amazon.fr <a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00JFQ5W0I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">a box of four toothpaste tubes</a>, but only one was in the box. I called Amazon’s customer center. The agent immediately found my order without me having to share the long order number. She issued a refund and told me I even can keep the one tube I received, no return was needed.  As a customer, I can’t ask for better customer service.</p> \n<p>Amazon <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us\">strives to be the earth’s most customer-centric company</a>, not only because it is the right thing to do for customers, but because over the long term, it’s good for the business. According to a <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/research/salesforce-state-of-the-connected-customer-4th-ed.pdf\">Salesforce study</a>, 80% of customers believe the experience a company provides is as important as its product or services. Over 90% of customers believe a positive customer service experience makes them more likely to make another purchase.</p> \n<p>Just like me, you might have been delighted by Amazon customer service already. We know that you want fast, convenient support and it’s what makes you loyal.</p> \n<p>This is why we created the <strong>AWS Contact Center Day conference</strong>. To learn from industry experts <a href=\"https://amer.resources.awscloud.com/aws-contact-center-day\">how to create your contact center of the future</a> in a free on-demand video conference.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Amazon’s Contact Centers</strong></span><br /> Amazon’s contact centers are critical to our mission to be focused on customer experience. Our contact centers have more than 100,000 customer-service associates in 32 countries who support millions of customers in dozens of languages. Given the scale and our strict requirements for security, resiliency, flexibility, agility, or automation, we couldn’t purchase an off-the-shelf solution. We decided to build our own.</p> \n<p>Everything that Amazon learned from our customer service organization, while looking to the future, has helped us bring to market <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/connect/\">Amazon Connect</a>, an easy-to-use omnichannel cloud contact center that helps businesses provide superior customer service at a lower cost. As the notion of the contact center has evolved, so have the expectations of customers. The contact center of the future isn’t a collection of disparate point solutions for taking a call or a chat, and it isn’t just an application that consolidates those technologies. It’s a platform that makes it easy to integrate with your enterprise applications or system of record. The contact center of the future makes it easy to use customer data in real time to personalize and contextualize all customer experiences.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Contact Centers Best Practices</strong></span><br /> To further support business looking to improve their contact centers, Amazon designed our first contact center focused event, <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/NAMER-field-OE-AWS-Contact-Center-Day-2021-reg-event.html\">AWS Contact Contact Center Day</a>, a way to share best practices, customer experience, and contact center technology, and to learn how to use Amazon Connect to accelerate the modernization of your contact centers.</p> \n<p>The one-day conference took place on July 13, 2021 and brought together some of the most influential people invested in the future of contact centers including: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/becky-ploeger/\">Becky Ploeger</a>, Global Head of <a href=\"https://www.hilton.com/en/\">Hilton</a> Reservations and Customer Care, and member of the <a href=\"https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/\">Customer Contact Week</a> advisory board; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewxdixon/\">Matt Dixon</a>, Chief Research and Innovation Officer at <a href=\"https://tethr.com/\">Tethr</a>, and author of <a href=\"https://dixonspeaks.com/books-and-more/\">multiple bestsellers</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation/dp/1591844355\">The Challenger Sale</a><u>;</u> <a href=\"https://hyken.com/\">Customer service expert</a>; author <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shephyken/\">Shep Hyken</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ill-Be-Back-Customers-Again-ebook/dp/B08XBJQTHW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=I%27ll+be+back&amp;qid=1625603175&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">I’ll Be Back: How to Get Customers to Come Back Again and Again</a>; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/briansolis/\">Brian Solis</a>, Global Innovation Evangelist, Salesforce, and best-selling author; and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahoneycutt/\">Mark Honeycutt</a>, Director of Consumer Operations, <a href=\"https://amazon.com/\">Amazon</a>.</p> \n<p>At Amazon, we have gone through years of trial and error to get to where our customer experience stands today. This is why we wanted to share our experiences with you so that you can learn from our progress:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Customers want super-human service. </strong>You can now automate routine customer experience and agent tasks. When I call my airline for a rebooking after a delayed flight, I expect to be greeted by name. I expect the system to know my flight was delayed and to offer rebooking suggestions. This can happen automatically today, without involving a customer agent. These automatic chatbot systems are personalized per customer. They are dynamic because they answer customer questions before they ask, and they are natural because they are based on voice interactions, like conversations between humans.</li> \n <li><strong>Customers expect personalized engagement.</strong> Amazon Connect allows for fast and secure interactions with real-time voice biometric authentication. There is no need to go through a lengthy authentication questionnaire anymore. After the customer is authenticated, the customer service agent has a 360-degree view of the customer’s profile, integrating and displaying data from across the enterprise and using machine learning to provide the right information at the right moment.</li> \n <li><strong>Contact centers must evolve quickly to answer changing needs.</strong> Contact center interactions must take action based on real-time data or customer sentiment. Leaders want to experiment, learn, and improve using customer analytics and data.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><strong>Learn more<br /> </strong></span>If you’re interested in learning more about contact center excellence, the entire Contact Center Day conference is now available on demand.</p> \n<p>Check out the full agenda and <a href=\"https://amer.resources.awscloud.com/aws-contact-center-day\"><strong>watch a session now</strong></a><strong> </strong>or learn more about <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/connect/\">Amazon Connect</a>.</p> \n<p>I am looking forward my next delightful customer experience using your contact centers.</p> \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebsto\">-- seb</a>","author":"Sébastien Stormacq","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"18311b6c2ee3e52ce5d9721a97eb4e4433124d914ed80660cf18cae49cfe9419","category":"Tech"}
