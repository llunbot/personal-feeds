The current ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ uses standard OLED technology, whereas MicroLED offers many of the benefits of OLED along with some improvements. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to LED displays, microLED is much more energy efficient and it would likely notably increase battery life on the ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ and other devices that adopt the technology in the future. Unlike OLED, there's much less risk of screen burn-in, and microLEDs have a longer potential lifetime.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicroLED displays also provide contrast improvements and faster response times because of the pixel-level individual lights, plus the color is better and brighter. In a nutshell, it's a next-generation technology superior to OLED and miniLED.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/apple-custom-displays-microled-apple-watch/\">already testing</a> microLED displays for the Apple Watch, and the displays are said to feature brighter, more vibrant colors and a look like content is \"painted on top of the glass.\" Apple is planning to bring the technology to the iPhone and other devices in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with all early rumors about devices that are a year or two or more out, they can be unreliable in terms of launch timing, as Apple often has to push back its release dates due to delays in design, component sourcing, manufacturing, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/\">MicroLED Apple Watch Ultra Now Rumored to Launch in 2026, Not 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microled-apple-watch-ultra-now-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-not-2025.2394997/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"66a3a93e67ec4e2bca2f5641a1ad30583c18cfd7e4fd7db06d8c5958e3a0cc0f","category":"Apple"}
