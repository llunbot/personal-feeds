{"title":"Jury Finds Masimo Smartwatches Infringed Apple Patents, Awards Apple Just Enough to Buy One Apple Watch SE","link":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/masimo-smartwatches-infringe-apple-patents-us-jury-says-2024-10-25/","date":1729976529000,"content":"\n<p>Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple convinced a federal jury on Friday that early versions of\nhealth monitoring tech company Masimo’s smartwatches infringe two\nof its design patents as part of a broader intellectual property\ndispute between the companies. The jury, in Delaware, agreed with\nApple that previous iterations of Masimo’s W1 and Freedom watches\nand chargers willfully violated Apple’s patent rights in\nsmartwatch designs.</p>\n\n<p>But the jury awarded the tech giant, which is worth about $3.5\ntrillion, just $250 in damages - the statutory minimum for\ninfringement in the United States. Apple’s attorneys told the\ncourt the “ultimate purpose” of its lawsuit was not money, but to\nwin an injunction against sales of Masimo’s smartwatches after an\ninfringement ruling.</p>\n\n<p>On that front, jury also determined that Masimo’s current watches\ndid not infringe Apple patents covering inventions that the tech\ngiant had accused Masimo of copying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>$250 is just enough for Apple to buy one of its own 40mm Apple Watch SE models. (No sales tax in Delaware.) That’s about all Apple got out of this. This victory doesn’t change <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/masimo+ITC\">the ITC import ban</a> that prevents Apple from enabling the blood oxygen sensor on watches sold in the U.S. after December 2023. It might have, if Apple had been able to win a verdict holding that Masimo’s current watches also infringe patents held by Apple. <a href=\"https://ipfray.com/apple-gets-250-verdict-against-masimo-loses-on-most-claims-apple-only-wanted-and-failed-to-create-new-reason-for-lifting-apple-watch-ban/\">Florian Mueller, writing at IP Fray</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In order to understand the reason why Apple sued over a product\npractically no one buys, one has to understand <em>the indirect\nramifications for Masimo’s U.S. import ban</em> on Apple Watches with\na pulse oximetry feature. Only the indirect implications matter in\nthis case. The short version is that if Masimo couldn’t have\ncontinued to sell its own smartwatch, they’d have lost a legally\nrequired basis for preventing Apple from selling smartwatches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/26/masimo-apple-250-bucks\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"05c5248b2ae818725fa55181a85901a37dd8be67b2c254903436b0da7db3f8b5","category":"Tech"}
