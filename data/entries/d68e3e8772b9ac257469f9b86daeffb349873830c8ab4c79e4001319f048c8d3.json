Apple's plans to design its own Wi-Fi chip were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/16/apple-chip-team-irvine/\">first reported in 2021</a>, so the project has seemingly been in development for quite some time now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile it is unclear if an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip would have any consumer benefits, it would allow the company to reduce its reliance on its current Wi-Fi chip supplier Broadcom, as part of Apple's effort to design more components in house.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 16 models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/all-iphone-16-models-support-wi-fi-7/\">support Wi-Fi 7</a>, which is advertised as being up to 4Ã— as fast as Wi-Fi 6E. A router with Wi-Fi 7 is also required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSimilarly, the first devices with an Apple-designed 5G chip are rumored to launch next year, including a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">new iPhone SE and the tentatively-named iPhone 17 Air</a>. This chip would allow Apple to move away from its current 5G chip supplier Qualcomm.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/2025-ipads-with-apple-wifi-chip-rumor/\">New iPads in 2025 Rumored to Feature Apple-Designed Wi-Fi Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipads-in-2025-rumored-to-feature-apple-designed-wi-fi-chip.2437038/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d68e3e8772b9ac257469f9b86daeffb349873830c8ab4c79e4001319f048c8d3","category":"Apple"}
