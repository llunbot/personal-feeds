In one, there is a ghostly third hand partially hidden under a white overprinted layer; the other has adjustments to the crown and other royal items in a portrait of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II\">Ramesses II</a>. These discoveries were made with a portable macro-X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) imaging device that enabled the researchers to analyze the paintings on site, with no need for taking physical samples.</p>\n<p>X-rays are a <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/csi-picasso-x-rays-reveal-the-master-8217-s-materials/\">well-established tool</a> to help analyze and restore valuable paintings because the rays' higher frequency means they pass right through paintings without harming them. X-ray imaging <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/x-rays-reveal-what-lies-beneath/\">can reveal anything</a> that has been painted over a canvas or where the artist may have altered his (or her) original vision. For instance, Vermeer's <em>Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window </em>was first subjected to X-ray analysis in 1979 and revealed the image of a Cupid lurking under the overpainting. In 2020, a team of Dutch and French scientists used high-energy X-rays <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/scientists-solve-the-mystery-of-rembrandts-impasto-paint-recipe/\">to unlock</a> Rembrandt's secret recipe for his famous <em>impasto</em> technique, believed to be lost to history.</p>\n<p>In 2021, scientists used macro-X-ray fluorescence imaging <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/x-ray-analysis-reveals-hidden-composition-under-iconic-portrait-of-the-lavoisiers/\">to map out</a> the distribution of elements in the paint pigments of Jean-Louis David's famous portrait of 17th-century chemist Antoine Lavoisier and his wife Marie-Anne—including the paint used below the surface—to create detailed elemental maps for further study.
