It has the same geometry as its carbon brethren but is crafted from DSW alloy. This bike has a unique personality all its own and welcomes Specialized back into the world of alloy off-road drop bar frames. The build, however, makes us wonder if it is better to choose your components and build from the frameset up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review back side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-back-side--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Return of the Alloy Crux </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve raced cyclocross for a while, you remember the days of the beautifully colored (and affordable) Specialized alloy Crux frames. These frames were staples at every cyclocross venue around the US and beyond. The frames and, eventually, complete bikes had a personality to them. Plus, riders could build up a frame and give their personal touch on the Crux canvas. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review Jordan Villella riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-riding--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Ryan Popple)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that Specialized sees a place for high-end alloy bikes in racing. The new Specialized Crux DSW comes at a perfect time when carbon super gravel bikes (even the Specialized ones) are priced out of touch with reality. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review header\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Frame: A Mix of Allez Sprint and Chisel </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re familiar with the Specialized DSW (D’Aluisio Smartweld) lineup, the DSW Crux is precisely what you’d expect. Specialized calls it the <em>“lightest alloy frame in the world,”</em> though the jury is still out on that claim. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review BB welds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-welds--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The welds over the Specialized Crux DSW frame are stout but smooth. The downtube flows directly into the bottom bracket without any welds. The headtube is more refined than the Allez Sprint and doesn’t use the same welding method. The top tube is sloping, like the current version of the Crux.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review shouldering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-shouldering--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tubing is less round than the carbon version and slightly pointed on the end where a cyclocross rider would shoulder the bike. Specialized’s target has moved towards the gravel and exploration crowd rather than the pure cyclocross racer. That said, the bike is fine to shoulder but not as comfortable as the previous version. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review Tire clearance stays\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance-stays--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The seat stays are thin, reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-the-specialized-chisel-is-much-more-than-an-entry-level-hardtail/\">Specialized Chisel hardtail</a>. The fork is the same as the carbon Crux models.

It arrives with a 40T front ring and an 11-44T XPLR cassette, giving it a solid range on gravel and off-road. The build speaks to the utility of the DSW Crux and helps keep it in the sub $3K ballpark. I have opinions on the SRAM Apex XPLR group set, but I’ll save that for my ride impressions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review riders eye\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-riders-eye--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wheels and Cockpit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels are simple and effective. They are DT Swiss tubeless aluminum rims with a 25mm internal width paired with Specialized-branded hubs. The wheels come wrapped with Specialized’s 38mm Pathfinder Pro tires—one of my favorite gravel tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cockpit stays in the alloy lane, arriving with Specialized Adventure Gear bars with a 70mm reach and a 12° flare. The saddle is another favorite of mine and is just as comfy as the top-tier version, the Specialized Power with alloy rails. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review Jordan Villella CX course\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-CX-course--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Ryan Popple)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ride Review: </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My first Specialized Crux DSW Comp ride was short and slightly shocking. I dialed in the new review ride, taking measurements from my trusty Carbon Crux of the same year. Once I was satisfied with the fit, I headed for gravel. However, as I crested the final climb out of my neighborhood, my rear brake failed just as I started my descent. More precisely, the SRAM Stealth-a-majig failed. I was lucky to have the front brake, but I was still shaken after the incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review SRAM Brake Fail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-Brake-Fail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review SRAM brake Failure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-SRAM-brake-Failure--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve had brakes fade and lose pressure during rides, but never like this.

Besides the different lever feel (I ride Shimano on my bike) the ride was very similar to the carbon version. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-tires--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Crux DSW Comp comes with 38mm tires, the hum of the alloy is pretty muted. The alloy seat post is the bike’s only harsh and heavy (330g) component. I imagine that’s where most will upgrade first to take the edge off, give a little compliance, and shed some weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review BB routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-BB-routing--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Easy to route cables and brake hose.

I can see this being a very popular option for cyclocross races and gravel racers alike. The pedaling is responsive, and the bike’s geometry is the same as the carbon version—less aggressive than the previous version but easy to steer. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review Jordan Villella climb cyclocross course\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Jordan-Villella-climb-cyclocross-course--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Ryan Popple)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crux DSW can hold its own in the woods and on single track. It’s slightly slower turning than a traditional cyclocross bike, but the short stem gives it a faster feel. Plus, when you get into the rocky and technical bits, the bike is effortless to pilot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review Tire clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-Tire-clearance--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Lots of room for larger tires (up to 45mm) on the alloy Crux.

The super thin seat stays soak up the bumps, and the larger tires do the rest. The frame is very stable on long open roads and decent, just like its carbon counterpart.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review rear brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-rear-brake--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our demo ride arrived in the satin oak paint scheme, and it wasn’t my favorite.

Though, if you’re into that (but slightly more tame), check out the frame-only options (above, $1,700) for the Crux DSW. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review bars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-bars--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the SRAM Apex XPLR group let me down initially, the shifting and braking performance was solid after I got sorted. The hoods are nice and wide, with a slight tooth on the brake lever. The shifting is crisp and easy to dial in. The XPLR gearing range is ample and will be an asset for anyone doing extended explorations on the Crux DSW. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review headtube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-headtube--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Final Thoughts </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I’m a fan of the Specialized Crux DSW Comp. It’s a performance alloy bike with an attainable price for anyone looking to jump into gravel or cyclocross. The frameset is rock solid and has an excellent feel and responsiveness. The bike is easily upgradable to shed some extra weight, even though it’s respectably light. The weakest spot for me is the SRAM Apex spec. It helps keep the price down, but a comparable Shimano spec would go a long way with riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Would I race Crux DSW?</em></strong> I would 100% race this bike. I’ve raced the carbon version of the Crux for years, and I love it. However, I would probably go with the <em>“choose your own adventure” </em>build route. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Crux DSW Review header post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Specialized-Crux-DSW-Review-header-post--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bottom Line </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Specialized Crux DSW Comp delivers an excellent ride and should help get more riders on gravel and between the tape. I recommend it to anyone looking to try gravel riding, commuting, or cyclocross. The $2,600 price tag is very reasonable for this much bike, and the fully stock 21lb (54cm) weight puts it on the pointy side of alloy life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/crux-dsw-comp/p/4221802?color=5368205-4221802\">Specialized.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-crux-dsw-comp-review/\">Specialized Crux DSW Comp Review: An Excellent Frame with a Single Build</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cffba43c3142c8398889a02f18d4ea837690f22e56c010878131a6ca465455bc","category":"Cycling"}
