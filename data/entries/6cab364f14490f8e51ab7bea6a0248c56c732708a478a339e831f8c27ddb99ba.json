The rocket was launched earlier that month, carrying 20 to 22 Starlink satellites into orbit.</p>\n<p>The authors said it is the first time debris from a specific spacecraft disintegration has been traced and measured in the near-space region about 80 to 110 kilometers above Earth. Changes there can affect the stratosphere, where ozone and climate processes operate. Until recent years, human activities had little impact in that region.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/study-shows-how-rocket-launches-pollute-the-atmosphere/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/study-shows-how-rocket-launches-pollute-the-atmosphere/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Bob Berwyn, Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6cab364f14490f8e51ab7bea6a0248c56c732708a478a339e831f8c27ddb99ba","category":"Tech"}
