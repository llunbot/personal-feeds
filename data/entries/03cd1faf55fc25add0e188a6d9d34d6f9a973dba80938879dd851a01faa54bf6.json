There are contoured edges that improve the feel of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> in the hand, and the Pro models are overall much more comfortable to hold. Apple also cut down on bezel size for even more display than ever, and the Action Button that replaces the Mute Switch is super convenient.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added a 5x zoom lens to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max and at its 120mm focal length, you can get great portrait shots. There are options on both Pro models to change the focal length of the Main camera, which you can do just by tapping. It can be set to 24mm, 28mm, or 35mm, and the ability to change focal length is useful for pro photographers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the standard ‌iPhone 15‌ models, they're more Pro-like than ever with the addition of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> and the new matte glass back. Apple say it is using back glass that has color infused throughout the material, and it's a nice look, especially with the pastel color options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor more on what Dan thought of the ‌iPhone 15‌ models, make sure to check out his full video, and for more of our coverage, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">visit our 2023 Apple Event hub</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-hands-on/\">Hands-On With the New iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-new-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-models.2401323/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"03cd1faf55fc25add0e188a6d9d34d6f9a973dba80938879dd851a01faa54bf6","category":"Apple"}
