From eMTB headlights to safer commuter taillights to a more powerful helmet lamp, they had a lot to show at Sea Otter Classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above is a concept they’re working on for e-bikes, with mountain bikes in particular focus. Many e-bikes now come with headlights built in and powered by the battery, but most of them are just bolted on to the fork crown or hanging under the handlebar. And most of those are designed for commuting, with a narrow beam pattern good for bike paths, but entirely inadequate for ripping technical trails in the woods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Outbound is designing something that looks better, with a broader beam pattern ideal for trail riding. They’re talking to Ibis now, which is what this prototype is built on, but the goal is to have something that fits almost every bike and handlebar/stem combo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Portal helmet light</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-03.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-03-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype outbound portal helmet light for mountain biking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-03.jpg 1845w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Closer to production is the new Outbound Portal, named after the trail in Moab. They’ve had the Hangover helmet light, which is designed to complement the Trail Evo handlebar light, but riders were asking them for something that was brighter and lasted longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-01.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1151\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-01-1536x1151.jpg\" alt=\"prototype outbound portal helmet light for mountain biking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-01-1536x1151.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-01.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-05.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-05-1536x570.jpg\" alt=\"prototype outbound portal helmet light for mountain biking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-05-1536x570.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-05-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-05-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-05-768x285.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-05.jpg 2020w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Hangover helmet light, the Portal has a larger 21700 battery (vs 18650) and will pump out about 1,400 lumens (vs ~1,000 lumens). That gives it 40% more run time, or 40% more brightness, depending on how you used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-04.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-04-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype outbound portal helmet light for mountain biking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-portal-MTB-helmet-light-prototype-04.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They made it as compact as possible, and it will use a new interchangeable mounting system that lets you use it on your helmet or handlebar, or even under your bar, but the beam pattern is optimized for right-side-up use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Target price is $180 with a June release target. This is preproduction unit shown here, they’re still finalizing the dual-mold cover design that eliminates loose seals or o-rings for a better, more watertight and easily serviceable design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outbound taillight concept</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-01.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-01-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype outbound tail light for cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-01.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their taillight is still in full prototype phase, but has several unique features that help make you safer and more visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-06-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"589\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-06-1536x589.jpg\" alt=\"beam pattern angles shown for prototype outbound tail light for cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-06-1536x589.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-06-297x114.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-06-120x46.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-06-768x294.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-06-2048x785.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It combines a bright red rear light with a yellow (amber) side marker light, and as a car approaches and views the light from an angle, it makes it appear as though the light changes from one to the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also casts a red light downward to light up your legs and feet as they pedal, which adds a lot of motion to the illumination, letting drivers better gauge distance and know you’re a fellow human.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-02.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-02-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype outbound tail light for cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-outbound-lighting-taillight-prototype-02.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The on/off/mode button (which will be covered for production, of course) is on top in easy reach. A battery indicator light stays on while the light is on, making it easy to see charge level.
