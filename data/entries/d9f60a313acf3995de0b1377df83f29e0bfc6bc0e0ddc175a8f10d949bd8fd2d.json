The measures are intended to bolster the production of critical components like batteries, camera modules, and microprocessors, which are currently largely imported from countries such as China. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government previously rolled out several initiatives, including the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which drew major companies like Apple and Samsung to set up or expand their production facilities in India. The focus of the new proposal is more granular, specifically targeting the establishment of a domestic supply chain for components. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been steadily increasing its production footprint in India. The company began assembling iPhones in India in 2017, initially focusing on older models. More recently, Apple has ramped up its operations, with India-produced iPhones now accounting for roughly 15% of the company's global output. Notably, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> saw its production in India commence just weeks after its global launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe proposed subsidies could further accelerate Apple's plans to localize production, potentially enabling simultaneous launches and production of future models, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, in both India and China. A final decision on the measures is expected to be announced during the upcoming federal budget in February.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/india-plans-subsidies-to-boost-apple-production/\">India Plans Subsidies to Boost Apple's Production Efforts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/india-plans-subsidies-to-boost-apples-production-efforts.2446787/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d9f60a313acf3995de0b1377df83f29e0bfc6bc0e0ddc175a8f10d949bd8fd2d","category":"Apple"}
