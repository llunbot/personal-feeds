Hunt says they weigh in at 1,524g.</p>\n<p>If you unsurprisingly can't get your hands on one of the nine, there is a chance to win the final pair of wheels by entering a competition on <a href=\"https://www.huntbikewheels.com/pages/limited-edition-qhubeka-x-hunt-54-aerodynamicist-carbon-disc-wheelsets\" target=\"_blank\">Hunt's website</a>, which closes on 25th July at 17:30.</p>\n<p>Qhubeka founder Anthony Fitzhenry said, 'We are very pleased that Hunt Wheels have decided to activate the #QHandUp campaign of Team Qhubeka-NextHash with these very special wheelsets at the Tour de France. Their partnership with the team is based on shared values and this collaboration is evidence of that.'</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4416/best-commuter-bikes\">The best commuter bikes 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/8977/best-electric-folding-bikes-buyers-guide\">Best electric folding bikes: buyer's guide</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 116: on sale now!</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9090/uk-bicycle-island-isle-of-wight-cycling-quiet-roads-punchy-climbs-sea-views\">Britain's best cycling destination?
