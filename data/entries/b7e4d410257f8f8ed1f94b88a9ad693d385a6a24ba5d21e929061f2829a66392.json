{"title":"Apple Releases New macOS 12 Monterey Public Beta","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/macos-monterey-public-beta-6/","date":1630441071000,"content":"Apple today seeded a new public beta of the macOS 12 Monterey beta to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> software ahead of its public release. The updated beta comes just a day after Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-6-to-developers/\">sixth macOS Monterey developer beta</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/macos-monterey-tidbits-feature-copy.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPublic beta testers can download the macOS 12 Monterey update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after installing the proper profile from <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">Apple's beta software website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces quite a few major updates for the macOS operating system. Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices, and it's now possible to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> directly to a Mac from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac. Universal Control isn't out yet, but we're still hoping it makes it into the Monterey launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari has an updated tab bar and support for Tab Groups to keep tons of tabs organized, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> now features support for spatial audio, Portrait Mode (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs only) and Voice Isolation for cutting out background noise. A SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature lets <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, another new feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and the Shortcuts app is now available on the Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA dedicated Focus mode helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions based on what's going on, and there's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features. With Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images. The new beta adds Live Text support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/macos-monterey-live-text-intel-based-macs/\">for Intel Macs</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected. There are many other new features in ‌‌macOS Monterey‌‌, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">complete overview</a> available in our ‌macOS Monterey‌ roundup. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also released new public betas of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>, and tvOS 15, and a fifth beta of Safari 15 for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a> and macOS Catalina users. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/macos-monterey-public-beta-6/\">Apple Releases New macOS 12 Monterey Public Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-macos-12-monterey-public-beta.2309336/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HoP2XOU4wDU:Zj_HTRmrDGw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HoP2XOU4wDU:Zj_HTRmrDGw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HoP2XOU4wDU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b7e4d410257f8f8ed1f94b88a9ad693d385a6a24ba5d21e929061f2829a66392","category":"Apple"}
