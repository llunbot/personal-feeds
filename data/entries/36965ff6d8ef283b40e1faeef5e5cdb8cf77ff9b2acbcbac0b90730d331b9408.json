The report says users can control which game's volume they want to hear by selecting it with the Siri Remote. To enable the feature, users will select the grid icon above the timeline bar, followed by a \"More Matches\" button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe existence of the multi-view option was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1640883202637086720\">first discovered by Steve Moser</a> last month, but it remained hidden in code. The feature is only available for sports games streamed by Apple through its TV app, meaning it is limited to MLB and the MLS for now. Apple has yet to officially announce when the multi-view feature will be available to the public, but tvOS 16.5 will likely be released within the next month or so.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/14/apple-tv-multi-view-sports-feature/\">Apple TV's Multi-View Sports Feature Available Starting Tonight on tvOS 16.5 Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tvs-multi-view-sports-feature-available-starting-tonight-on-tvos-16-5-beta.2386839/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"36965ff6d8ef283b40e1faeef5e5cdb8cf77ff9b2acbcbac0b90730d331b9408","category":"Apple"}
