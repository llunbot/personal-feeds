The successful applicant to the post will play a pivotal role in bringing together trail building groups from across the UK, as well as land owners, land managers and governing bodies, with knowledge sharing and relationship development being at the core of their activities. Surely, this is a great step forward in ensuring that the UK Trail network is able to support growth in mountain biking well into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s pretty cool to see financial investment from the industry, and something I hope we’ll be seeing more of in future.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"tvta dig day trail building edr race tracks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tvta-tril-crew-dig-day.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Tweed Valley Trails Association members maintaining a track raced in the 2021 EWS (now the EDR, of course).

With around 6% of the UK population mountain biking on a regular basis, it is really important that we can support the mountain bike community to come together with governing bodies to work with land managers and owners to sustainably develop an exciting and varied trail network at all levels.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The key to this project, and role, will be the ability to share knowledge, bring people together to understand common issues and opportunities, and further develop relationships at all levels across the all UK home countries.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We are extremely grateful for the enthusiasm and passion of the steering group, along with the project funders and partners, SRAM. We are really excited to see the impact this project will have.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step of the project will be to develop a UK wide ‘Right trail, right place, right people, right time’ report which will help audit the current number and position of trail groups and associations in each country and a deeper understanding of the opportunities to improve the management of the trail network. The report will also take cognisance of the pressures in supporting the trail network, particularly, for land managers/owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is anticipated that following this report, the project’s focus, objectives, target audiences, KPIs, and messaging will vary depending on each nation’s needs and current situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly-800x515.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly-800x515.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly-297x191.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly-768x494.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly-1536x989.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aberdeenshire-trails-association-with-manon-carpenter-ella-connoly.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Aberdeenshire Trails Association members at a dig day, attended by some of the celebrities of our sport.

It will also help to develop the competencies of the MTB community, to improve the sustainable management of mountain biking activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Cook, Forestry England’s National Cycle Infrastructure Manager said:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The UK Trails Project is an amazing opportunity to connect riders, trail associations and land managers. It will help to improve understanding of, and see more people using, the right trails, right place, right people, right time principles.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The UK undoubtedly has some of the best riding and facilities in the world, with passionate people and limited resources, and this project can help everyone involved better manage these sustainably for the long-term.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We ultimately need a resilient off-road cycling network built and used taking account of many factors such as other users, ecology, wildlife and heritage, access and land management requirements.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Rafferty, MTB Communications Manager – SRAM UK, said:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We have been impressed with the work of DMBinS over several years, and we are delighted to play our part in helping improve the long-term sustainability of trails, and trail access, across the UK.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We believe that this project can sensitively and strategically work with mountain bikers and a range of partners to support the trail network across the UK, ultimately leading to a secure future for our trail network – the most valuable resource in mountain biking. We are excited to play our part in making this project happen.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How to Apply</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>DMBinS are still taking applications for the post of UK Trails Project Manager, with the deadline set to 12 Noon (BST) Monday 21st August, 2023. <a href=\"https://dmbins.com/blog/uk-trails-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to apply</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://dmbins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DMBinS.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-fund-3-year-uk-trails-project-manager-applications-now-open/\">SRAM Fund 3 Year UK Trails Project Manager -Applications Now Open</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f3aae2f365ebe39c6204164d8a917e5891a031ae6d840ac018dc69652eaa16fc","category":"Cycling"}
