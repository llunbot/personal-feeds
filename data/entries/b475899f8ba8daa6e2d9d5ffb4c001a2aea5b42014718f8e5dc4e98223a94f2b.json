Please visit your Account page for the most recent estimate on when you can expect your order to be fulfilled,\" SpaceX said in an FAQ on the <a href=\"https://support.starlink.com/\">Starlink support website</a>. The language was added to the Starlink website on Thursday night, <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/starlink-website-nixes-beta-wording-warns-chip-shortage-is-delaying-orders\">according to a PCMag article</a>.</p>\n<p>Starlink has apparently just exited its beta status. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/spacex-starlink-will-come-out-of-beta-next-month-elon-musk-says/\">said in September</a> that it would emerge from beta in October, and the word \"beta\" was deleted from descriptions on the Starlink <a href=\"https://www.starlink.com/\">homepage</a> late last week. The website was also updated to advertise \"download speeds between 100Mbps and 200Mbps and latency as low as 20ms in most locations,\" an improvement over the previously stated \"50Mbps to 150Mbps and latency from 20ms to 40ms in most locations.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809226#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809226&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b475899f8ba8daa6e2d9d5ffb4c001a2aea5b42014718f8e5dc4e98223a94f2b","category":"Tech"}
