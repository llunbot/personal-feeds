We’ll use it until it wears off, and we replace it. \nWe can rely on that product not evolving; the gas pedal in my car \nwill always be in the same place. </p>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to software, we usually have the ingrained \nexpectations of perpetual updates. We believe that if software \ndoesn’t evolve it’ll be boring, old and unusable. If we see an \napp with no updates in the last year, we think the creator might \nbe dead. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://social.masto.land/@dave/111330916694532002\">Via Dave Winer</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/finished-software\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ca1ef44c9685bb415db872a2b209f548c8c568b30bd974670deba4b592017b99","category":"Tech"}
