GRID Studio turns key devices from Apple history into art that can be displayed in the home or office.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-1.jpg\" width=\"1348\" height=\"759\" />\r<br />\nGRID's art pieces feature a deconstructed Apple device with the components laid out underneath a glass frame. Each part is clearly labeled, and interesting historical facts are included. GRID Studio has a range of different products available, with prices that start at $40 and go up based on the complexity and rarity of the original device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe GRID 1, <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">priced at $400</a>, features Apple's first-ever <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that came out in 2007. It includes all of the components from the original ‌iPhone‌, from the curved shell to the power button, headphone socket, and logic board.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/GRID-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nGRID's <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s\">$139 GRID 4s</a> showcases the successor to the ‌iPhone‌ 4. The ‌iPhone‌ 4s initially came out in 2011, and it was Apple's fifth-ever ‌iPhone‌. The 4s was notable because the \"s\" represented <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, a smart personal assistant that was, at the time, exclusive to the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/GRID_4S.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio doesn't just do iPhones. The <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/apple-watch-series-0\">$200 GRID Watch 1</a> includes the original 2015 Apple Watch, which was the first wrist-worn wearable that Apple came out with. The GRID piece includes the S1 chip, Apple's first system-on-a-chip, along with the original Apple Watch casing and the other internal components of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/GRID-WATCH.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple silicon fans will appreciate the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AEm1-chip\">$199 GRID M1</a> that celebrates Apple's first in-house Mac chip. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> is an important part of Apple's history, and the GRID piece encases it in resin and provides a rundown on all of the features, including the 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, and dedicated Neural Engine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/GRID-M1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nFor Mac fans, GRID Studio also sells the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid-macbook-air-1st-generation\">GRID MacBook Air</a> for $599. This piece highlights the first-generation 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ that came out in 2008, which Apple called the world's thinnest notebook and marketed as an ultraportable computer. The ‌MacBook Air‌ had an aluminum casing and a white bezel around the display, and it was equipped with a custom Intel chip, a full-size keyboard, and a multi-touch trackpad.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/GRID-MacBook-Air.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio is having a holiday sale right now, with a promo code on the site offering 15 percent off.
