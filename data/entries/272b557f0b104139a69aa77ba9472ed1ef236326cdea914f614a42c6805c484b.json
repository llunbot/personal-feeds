I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dcrainmakerblog\">on Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/dcrainmaker\">Facebook</a>, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><span>DCR Posts in the Past Week:</span></h3>\n<p>Here’s all the latest on the site:</p>\n<p>Sunday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/07/week-in-review-july-9th-2023.html\">Week in Review–July 9th, 2023</a><br />\nTuesday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/07/huge-amazon-prime-day-2023-sports-tech-deals-tracker.html\">Huge Amazon Prime Day 2023 Sports Tech Deals Tracker!</a><br />\nWednesday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/07/garmin-forerunner-features.html\">Garmin Forerunner 255/265/955/965 Get Slate of New Features in Beta</a><br />\nWednesday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/07/apple-watch-os-10-topographic-maps-hands-on-first-look-2.html\">Apple WatchOS 10 Topographic Maps: Hands-on with the Public Beta</a><br />\nThursday: <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/07/garmin-adds-training-readiness-morning-report-to-instinct-2-in-new-beta.html\">Garmin Adds Training Readiness &amp;

But again, OpSec. As has always been the case, if you have a reason (be it personal privacy or military operational security), don’t post things to social networks that give away your location (or operational details). This isn’t new. It’s not some new-fangled realization of 2023 or even 2015.</p>\n<p><strong>2) </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/13/23793591/cowboy-vanmoof-key-app-download-ios-android\"><strong>Cowboy creates app to hep VanMoof Bike Users:</strong></a> With VanMoof apparently a sinking ship, this app from their e-bike rival lets one create a virtual key to access your bike, in the event VanMoof goes entirely out of business. I’m still dumbfounded as to how VanMoof screwed this up. Hopefully they sort it out, if for no other reason than the dozen teenagers on my Amsterdam street that own one.</p>\n<p><strong>3) </strong><a href=\"https://manuals.stagescycling.com/en/dash-m200-l200/firmware-release/\"><strong>Stages M200/L200 get upcoming climb details:</strong></a> There isn’t a ton of information on the firmware updates page, but I’ll try and get a unit updated to give a whirl later this week.</p>\n<p><strong>4) </strong><a href=\"https://escapecollective.com/the-liquid-life-of-a-sweaty-tour-de-france-mascot/\"><strong>The life of a Tour de France Mascot:</strong></a> If you gave me a hundred guesses, I never would have guessed the person actually stuck inside one of those mascots.</p>\n<p><strong>5) </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdoA_6WITM8\"><strong>Quick Hands-On Look at new WatchOS 10 Features:</strong></a> Matt gives a nice cinematic look at what’s new in WatchOS 10.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>6) </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23785871/rad-power-bikes-uk-europe-shut-down-ebike\"><strong>RAD Bikes pulls out of Europe:</strong></a> Can’t say I’m surprised here. While we do have one friend that has one in France, I rarely see them on the roads of Amsterdam (despite RAD Bikes having their European HQ here).</p>\n<p><strong>7) I don’t have a #7.</strong> Usually I have no problems getting to 8 or more things, but outside of having 20 Tour de France things (of which, many are worthy), it was actually kinda a quiet week in sports tech-ish kind of news. Or, at least news I thought interesting. On the bright side, I’ll be back at the Tour de France this week for the time trial stage, plus more adventures in the mountains.
