From there, you can toggle it on. After you use apps for some time, data will begin showing up in this spot.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nToday's update adds updates to the Emergency SOS Auto Call feature. You can now press the side button rapidly multiple times to initiate, or hold down the side button and the volume button together. There's a longer eight-second countdown before a call is placed, which is up from the prior three-second countdown.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also tweaked the Notification Summary feature in the beta, giving summaries more of a card-style look, and there's code for the Communication Safety feature that Apple announced earlier this year.
