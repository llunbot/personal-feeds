The move follows Musk’s endorsement \nof antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as Apple ads reportedly \nbeing placed alongside far-right content. Apple has been a major \nadvertiser on the social media site and its pause follows a \n<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/11/17/x-elon-musk-ibm-amazon-apple-ads-antisemitic\">similar move by IBM</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Musk faced backlash for <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/11/16/elon-musk-antisemitic-claim-tesla-shares\">endorsing an antisemitic post</a> \nWednesday, as 164 Jewish rabbis and activists <a href=\"https://www.xouthate.org/\">upped their \ncall</a> to Apple, Google, Amazon and Disney to stop \nadvertising on X, and for Apple and Google to remove it from their \nplatforms. </p>\n\n<p>The left-leaning nonprofit Media Matters for America published \n<a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle\">a report</a> Thursday that highlighted Apple, IBM, \nAmazon and Oracle as among those whose ads were shown next to \nfar-right posts. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s fair, in some sense, to describe Media Matters for America as “left-leaning”, but they have a decades-long reputation for accuracy. They don’t publish hit pieces that are later proven to have been manipulated. There’s no reason to doubt <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle\">their report or the screenshots it contained</a> — especially if, like me, you still do check in on Twitter. This is what it’s like over there now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/17/tech/lionsgate-suspends-advertising-x-musk/index.html\">Disney and Warner Bros Discovery have suspended advertising on Twitter/X too</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/17/apple-ibm-twitter\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"eb97a37e3a4a4e247a0c74110cd734dec732abf4667598deb806c523f03fb826","category":"Tech"}
