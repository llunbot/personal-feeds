The operating system needs to know what you’re looking at at all times—it’s a critical part of the user interface, but it’s also a part of the entire graphics rendering system. Vision Pro performs <em>foveated rendering</em>, where the display is drawn pixel-perfect in the exact spot where you are looking and at a lower resolution as you move away from the center of your view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, the headset automatically moves the screens closer together or further apart to match your IPD (Inter Pupillary distance, or how far apart your eyes are). If either the IPD is off or the eye tracking stops working well, your view will be out of focus and you might not be able to reliably control the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel like your Vision Pro headset isn’t tracking your gaze properly or the screens are a little out of focus, try recalibrating the eye tracking and realigning the displays to your IPD.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>Redo the eye and hand setup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can run through the eye-tracking and hand-tracking calibration process again at any time. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Press the Top Button on the top left of Vision Pro four times quickly.
