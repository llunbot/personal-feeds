It has a blend of history, culture, sights, coastline, good weather and good (both easy and hard) riding that is as good as it gets anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to explore Andalucía by bike is with Toro Blanco Active Holidays, which is ready to help you have the ultimate trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s on offer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Day-5-8-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Toro Blanco’s expert guides have endless local knowledge and years of experience, they’ve put together two multi-day tours that balance incredible riding with all the sightseeing you need to do in Andalucía.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your trip, Toro Blanco will take care of everything, including transfers, hotels (which are all either four- or five-star), all meals and drinks (at the best local restaurants), bike hire if you need it, coaching where desired, and support vehicles whenever you ride. That also means if one of your group isn’t up for the whole ride (there are also e-bikes available) they can jump in the car to get to the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The tours</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-970x970.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/324858554_1154648471852941_4381786471929230541_n.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Toro Blanco’s first tour option is an eight-day, seven-night VIP holiday that includes five days cycling and two or three additional trips to make sure you get to experience the best that the region has to offer. It includes five guides, four support vehicles, a bike mechanic and a masseuse, and there’s even an optional extra visit to an olive oil factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second option is five days, four nights with three days cycling and two extra trips. It has all the perks of the bigger tour but there’s a bit less cycling</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The sights</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-970x448.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-970x448.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-768x355.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-1536x710.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-2048x946.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-750x347.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Caminito-Del-Rey-1-1140x527.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day will show off the beauty of Andalucía, including rivers and valleys, old roads, market towns, stunning Moorish architecture, vast desert, lush fields and some of Europe’s highest mountains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting from the town of Pizarra in the Málaga province, the tour will take you through to Antequera with its fortress and neighbouring nature preserve. That leads you over rolling roads, past asparagus farms and quiet villages to Granada city, at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains and the centre of the region’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A visit to the Alhambra Palace in Granada is an absolute must, and Toro Blanco offers a guided tour of the palace as part of the trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all though. From there you’ll head on to Guadix, which dates back to the Bronze Age and is surrounded by vast natural beauty, with a warm spring located 10km out of town. Finally the last part of the journey will take you to the Caminito de Rey, an incredible walkway inside a narrow gorge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for?
