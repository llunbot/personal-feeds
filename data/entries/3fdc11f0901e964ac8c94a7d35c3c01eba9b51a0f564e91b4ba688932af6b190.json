But it's also $50 cheaper and a fair bit faster than the outgoing 4070 Ti Super and the older 4070 Ti. These are steps in the right direction, if small ones.</p>\n<p>We'll talk more about its performance shortly, but at a high level, the 5070 Ti's performance falls in the same general range as the 4080 Super and the original RTX 4080, a card <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/\">that launched for $1,199</a> just over two years ago. And it's probably your floor for consistently playable native 4K gaming for those of you out there who don't want to rely on DLSS or 4K upscaling to hit that resolution (it's also probably all the GPU that most people will need for high-FPS 1440p, if that's more your speed).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-an-rtx-4080-for-749-at-least-in-theory/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-an-rtx-4080-for-749-at-least-in-theory/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3fdc11f0901e964ac8c94a7d35c3c01eba9b51a0f564e91b4ba688932af6b190","category":"Tech"}
