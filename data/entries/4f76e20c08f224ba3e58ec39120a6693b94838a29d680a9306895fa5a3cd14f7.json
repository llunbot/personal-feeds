But that hasn't stopped headset makers from blinging out their products. Besides, if you're on camera livestreaming or talking to your teammates, you might be looking to spice things up with <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/mobile-headsets/razer-kraken-bt-kitty-edition/RZ04-03520100-R3U1\" target=\"_blank\">pink cat ears</a> or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3pJNrfR\" target=\"_blank\">RGB-infused earcups</a>. The <a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/headsets-audio/headsets/usb-headsets/rog-delta-s-animate-model/\" target=\"_blank\">Asus ROG Delta S Animate</a> offers a new, pixel-powered twist to gamers who want to put on a show.</p>\n<p>Asus has put its AniMe Matrix custom lighting design system on both of the Delta S Animate's earcups. Mini LEDs fill the space and light up to depict preset or customized effects selected via Asus' free Armoury Crate software. An Asus spokesperson told Ars Technica that the ROG Delta S Animate has over 100 mini LEDs per earcup. Until this week, the AniMe Matrix was only available on select Asus Zephyrus gaming laptops. Asus' decision to continue offering the feature in new PCs—and now in a new category—shows the company is seeing some interest in the concept.</p>\n<p>Want ghosts flying across the earcup pixel by pixel before turning into a pumpkin?
