If you’re not interested in investing in $100 worth of adapters but still yearn for an iPod-like experience, there’s now an app for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An app called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-classic-retro-console/id6443811423\">My Classic-Retro Console</a> can display a GameBoy-like app that acts as a UI for the Music, Podcasts, and Camera app, and also includes a Breakout-type game. But the app also has an option within its settings for <em>Device</em> and if you select <em>My Classic</em> it opens up an iPod-like app that you can use to access your Music library. You can even use the digital click wheel to scroll up and down, and tap the fast-forward, rewind, play/pause, and menu icons to make selections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re in iPod mode, you can also customize your iPod color: Special (black with a red clickwheel, like the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/666272/ipod-u2-special-edition-review.html\">U2 iPod</a>) Silver, Dark (black with a black clickwheel), Black (black with a gray clickwheel), and White. It’s just like you’re in 2004 all over again–all that’s missing are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-EarPods-Headphones-Lightning-Connector/dp/B0D7FVQ1ZB/\">wired Earpods</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The My Classic-Retro Console app is just $2.99 (with an in-app donation button if you’re feeling kind) and as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-classic-retro-console/id6443811423\">commenters on X</a> have pointed out, it will probably not be in the App Store for very long as Apple has a history of taking down or rejecting iPod emulators. So if you want to turn your iPhone into an iPod, you should probably grab it like right now.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3c83b9bc530bf0e4ce34de5362d722c8bedec2dd8d90a16858c5719c9f5f9445","category":"Apple"}
