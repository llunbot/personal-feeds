This division, which includes missile production for the military and space activities such as satellites and the Starliner spacecraft, lost $1.7 billion during the first three quarters of this year.</p>\n<p>In a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Boeing's chief executive, David Calhoun, and chief financial officer, Brian West, expressed disappointment in these results from the defense and space division. They reiterated their goal of returning the company's defense and space businesses to profitability by the 2025 to 2026 period.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978581#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978581&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24845354613f75470d612c05f432db0b63ebd5475483a410c367da920e50fd9f","category":"Tech"}
