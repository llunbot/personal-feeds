Well, no… most of us weren’t, but Wisconsin’s Trek Bicycles was, in a red barn, so the story goes. Trek says the Red Barn Refresh program is the cycling industry’s first manufacturer-led, bike trade-in and refurbishment program. The goal here is to make it easy to “return a used bike in exchange for store credit”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-certified-awesome.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-certified-awesome.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Red Barn Program certified awesome\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-certified-awesome.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-certified-awesome-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-certified-awesome-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-certified-awesome-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-logo-2.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"540\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-logo-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Red Barn Program logo 2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-logo-2.jpeg 540w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-logo-2-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trek-Red-Barn-Program-logo-2-120x90.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Trek, the used bikes are to be traded in at any Trek store or participating Trek retailer. The bike is then returned to the Red Barn in Waterloo, Wisconsin.
