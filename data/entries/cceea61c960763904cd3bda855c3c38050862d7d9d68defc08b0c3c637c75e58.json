Despite adhesive holding in the screen and the fact that you need to remove the heatsink to get at the battery, it's still much more repairable than past Surfaces or competing tablets.

The company has published detailed repair manuals <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/microsoft-posts-its-own-teardown-and-repair-video-for-the-surface-laptop-se/\">and videos</a> and has made <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/surface-9-pro-teardown-reveals-modular-parts-microsofts-2023-repair-plans/\">changes to its hardware designs</a> over the years to make it easier to open them without breaking them and easier to replace parts once you’re inside. Microsoft also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/microsoft-adds-pricey-diy-surface-repair-parts-to-online-store/\">sells some first-party parts for repairs</a>, though not every part from every Surface is available, and Microsoft and iFixit have partnered to <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Microsoft_Tablet\">offer other parts as well</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, iFixit has torn apart the most recent Snapdragon X-powered Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices and has mostly high praise for both devices <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7KXJQ0p00\">in its preliminary teardown video</a>. Both devices earn an 8 out of 10 on iFixit's repairability scale, thanks to <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2033069%26action%3Dedit&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D100440&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=102f803fe2b83ed4f8c861f1f46aa83a&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D\">Microsoft's first-party service manuals</a>, the relative ease with which both devices can be opened, and clearly labeled internal components.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033069#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033069&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cceea61c960763904cd3bda855c3c38050862d7d9d68defc08b0c3c637c75e58","category":"Tech"}
