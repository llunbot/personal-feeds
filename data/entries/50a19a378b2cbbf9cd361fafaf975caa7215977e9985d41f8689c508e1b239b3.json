Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and also attended the event, and other tech CEOs and companies have been plying the administration with funds. Apple did not donate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> says that several major companies are reevaluating their stance on advertising on X. Amazon plans to up its ad spending as well, and the boost in advertising could help X with some of its debt. In January, Musk said that user growth was stagnant, revenue was \"unimpressive,\" and that the company was \"barely breaking even.\"<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/apple-x-ads-talks/\">Apple Might Start Buying Ads on X Again</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-might-start-buying-ads-on-x-again.2448428/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"50a19a378b2cbbf9cd361fafaf975caa7215977e9985d41f8689c508e1b239b3","category":"Apple"}
