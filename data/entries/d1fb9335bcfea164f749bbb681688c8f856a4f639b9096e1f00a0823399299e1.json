So, what would happen if you combined the two? Well, the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/oneup-components/\" target=\"_blank\">OneUp</a> Wave pedals would happen.

The raised front also makes it easier to readjust your foot without taking your shoe off the pedal completely.” And meanwhile, “the back half of the pedal is sloped to promote an aggressive heels-down foot position for more power and control. This new profile keeps your feet in place without solely relying on longer, sharper pins.” To accompany the heels-down design, the pins are angled forward, so they’re oriented more vertically while riding.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_BearingsAxle.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Specs:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 355g (Pair)</li>\n<li><strong>Thickness:</strong> Axle 14.2mm / Edges 11.5mm</li>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 110mm (W x L)</li>\n<li><strong>Bearing configuration:</strong> Inboard igus™ Bushing and 3x outboard cartridge bearings</li>\n<li><strong>Body:</strong> Forged and CNC’d 6061 Aluminum Body</li>\n<li><strong>Axle:</strong> Chromoly Steel with Black ED coating</li>\n<li><strong>Pins:</strong> M4 Hollow Pin 10 x pins per side (self-cleaning hex through hole)</li>\n<li><strong>Colors:</strong> Black, Red, Dark Green, Dark Blue, Orange, Purple, Grey, Bronze</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp_WavePedals_ColourRange_PressRelease.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p><strong>US</strong> – $159.99<br />\n<strong>CAD</strong> -$ 199.99<br />\n<strong>UK</strong> – £149.99<br />\n<strong>EU</strong> – €174.99<br />\n<strong>ROW</strong> – $186.99</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp-Components-Wave-Pedal-Hero.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp-Components-Wave-Pedal-Hero.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp-Components-Wave-Pedal-Hero.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/OneUp-Components-Wave-Pedal-Hero.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The OneUp Wave Pedals have been in development since early 2022, having gone through several iterations until its release more than three years later.
