{"title":"Things Are Not Going Well at Automattic","link":"https://www.404media.co/automattic-buyout-offer-wordpress-matt-mullenweg/","date":1729195836000,"content":"\n<p>Samantha Cole, reporting for 404 Media:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In July, before the latest WP Engine blowup, an Automattic\nemployee wrote in Slack that they received a direct message from\nMullenweg sending them an identification code for Blind, an\nanonymous workplace discussion platform, which was required to\ncomplete registration on the site. Blind requires employees to use\ntheir official workplace emails to sign up, as a way to\nauthenticate that users actually work for the companies they are\ndiscussing. Mullenweg said on Slack that emails sent from Blind’s\nplatform to employees’ email addresses were being forwarded to\nhim. If employees wanted to log in or sign up for Blind, they’d\nneed to ask Mullenweg for the two-factor identification code. The\nimplication was that Automattic — and Mullenweg — could see who\nwas trying to sign up for Blind, which is often a place where\npeople anonymously vent or share criticism about their workplace.</p>\n\n<p>“We were unaware that Matt redirected sign-up emails until current\nAutomattic employees contacted our support team,” a spokesperson\nfor Blind told me, adding that they’d “never seen a CEO or\nexecutive try to limit their employees from signing up for Blind\nby redirecting emails.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That does not seem compatible a culture of trust. Cole also reports that Mullenweg has made another buyout offer this week, and is threatening employees who leak to the press. This very report from 404 Media, under the headline “Employees Describe an Environment of Paranoia and Fear Inside Automattic Over WordPress Chaos”, is not going to help. The whole situation is just very depressing.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/17/things-are-not-going-well-at-automattic\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5f375c34ea634a30a8414daf5f5437f8fd8494d603133cd9196f49482fc9885e","category":"Tech"}
