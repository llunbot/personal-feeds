The hub delivers consistent 90W charging to host devices, regardless of connected peripherals, thanks to its compact 180W power supply.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisplay support includes dual 8K monitors at 60Hz or dual 4K at 240Hz refresh rates, leveraging Thunderbolt 5's new Bandwidth Boost feature. CalDigit notes that Windows machines can handle up to three displays through a single Thunderbolt 5 connection, but unfortunately Mac users are limited to dual displays due to macOS limitations, even when using Apple's latest M4 chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe hub doubles PCIe bandwidth to 64Gb/s compared to its predecessor, allowing it to accommodate faster storage devices. Meanwhile, power delivery remains stable at 90W for host charging, with 15W available from each downstream Thunderbolt 5 port and 7.5W from USB ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/caldigit-tb-5-hub-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe Element 5 Hub is available now <a href=\"https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-5-element-5-hub/\">direct from CalDigit</a> in the United States for $249.95, with UK and EU availability expected in mid to late February 2025.
