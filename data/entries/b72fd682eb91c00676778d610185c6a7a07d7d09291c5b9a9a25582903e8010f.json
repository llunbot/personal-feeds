This makes it the first company to clear the 100-qubit mark, a milestone that's interesting because the interactions of that many qubits can't be simulated using today's classical computing hardware and algorithms.</p>\n<p>But what may be more significant is that IBM now <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-roadmap\">has a roadmap</a> that would see it producing the first 1,000-qubit processor in two years. And, according to IBM Director of Research Darío Gil, that's the point where calculations done with quantum hardware will start being useful.</p>\n<h2>What’s new</h2>\n<p>Gil told Ars that the new qubit count was a product of multiple developments that have been put together for the first time. One is that IBM switched to what it's calling a \"heavy hex\" qubit layout, which it <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/heavy-hex-lattice\">announced earlier this year</a>. This layout connects qubits in a set of hexagons with shared sides. In this layout, qubits are connected to two, three, or a maximum of four neighbors—on average, that's a lower level of connectivity than some competing designs. But Gil argued that the tradeoff is worth it, saying \"it reduces the level of connectivity, but greatly improves crosstalk.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813523#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813523&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b72fd682eb91c00676778d610185c6a7a07d7d09291c5b9a9a25582903e8010f","category":"Tech"}
