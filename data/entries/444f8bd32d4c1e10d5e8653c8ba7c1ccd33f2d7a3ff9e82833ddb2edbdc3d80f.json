Apple releases new Apple Watch models (called “series”) on a yearly cadence, and the price rarely changes by all that much. So to avoid buying an Apple Watch that is outdated after just a few weeks, you want to time it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what we know about Apple Watch release dates and when you should or should not buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 11/04/21:</strong> With the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/547360/apple-watch-series-7-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> now available, we have updated this article with our latest buying advice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch: Pricing and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most recent release: October 2021</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released the Apple Watch Series 7 on October 15, 2021. It’s mostly identical to the Series 6, only with a bigger display thanks to slimmer bezels and a USB-C charging cable that enables slightly faster charging. It carries the same price the Series 6 did, starting at $399.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fall of 2020 Apple introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234647/apple-watch-se-review.html\">Apple Watch SE</a>. It’s basically a slightly updated Series 4 and starts at $279 for 40mm and $309 for 44mm, with cellular options costing $50 extra. It’s often a little cheaper at Amazon. Apple often sells earlier-model Apple Watches at a reduced price, and right now that’s the Series 3, which starts at a modest $199. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Series 7</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-colors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399 (base model)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch&amp;subid1=1-1-352228-5-357693-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$399 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HF1DC1J?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$439.00 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/29622/1036?prodsku=ACMKMX3LLA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FACMKMX3LLA.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_230&amp;xcust=1-1-352228-5-357693-9934&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Not Available at Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch: Why you should buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we don’t think the Series 7 is much of an upgrade over the Series 6, it <em>is</em> better, and is essentially the best smartwatch you can buy. It was recently released and there isn’t expected to be a new Apple Watch model until the fall of 2022. If you want to buy an Apple Watch, now’s the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE is not updated yearly, so even though its a year old, it’s still the latest model and probably won’t be updated again until the fall of 2022. We think the larger display with thinner bezels, much better performance, and a heap of additional features (like fall detection and noise monitoring) make it a much better deal than the Series 3 and you can often find it on sale at Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch: Why you should wait</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real reason to wait on buying an Apple Watch at this point is if you have a Series 5 or Series 6, and are looking for the next big upgrade. The Series 7’s larger screen is a nice improvement over the Series 5/6, but that’s really the only major change this year. If you have a Series 4 or earlier, you’ll appreciate the performance and features, but you should probably wait for the Series 8 if you have a newer Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macworld recommends: BUY</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to buy an Apple Watch, go right ahead. With new models not expected until the fall of 2022, this is as good a time to buy as any. We don’t think the Series 7 is a very big upgrade over the Series 6, so those with a watch only a couple years old might consider waiting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one caveat would be if you can find a really great sale on the Series 6. The Series 7 is only a small improvement, so if you see the Series 6 on sale for something like $80 off the usual price, you’ll probably be glad you snagged it before it goes away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to buy an Apple Watch Series 3, we think that’s not a good idea. Yes, it’s very affordable, but the small display with large bezels, limited sensors, and slower processor all make it sort of an evolutionary dead-end for Apple Watch, and we’re not sure how much longer it will be supported by new versions of watchOS. Apple Watch SE is a much better buy.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch SE (2020)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/apple-watch-se-press-100858144-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://macworld.com/article/234647/apple-watch-se-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$279\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-se&amp;subid1=1-1-352228-5-198235-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$279 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6215915&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6215915%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-352228-5-198235-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$279.00 at Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5XX59T?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$285.59 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"444f8bd32d4c1e10d5e8653c8ba7c1ccd33f2d7a3ff9e82833ddb2edbdc3d80f","category":"Apple"}
