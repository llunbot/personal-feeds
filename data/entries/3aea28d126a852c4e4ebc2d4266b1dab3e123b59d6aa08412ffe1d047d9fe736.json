Read on to find out what’s coming from Apple in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we take a look at what new products we expect Apple to launch throughout 2025 and beyond. We have investigated every rumor and trend we could find to bring you our predictions. Read on to find out what could be in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple products launched so far in 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin with the predictions, here’s a quick look at what Apple released so far in 2025:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>February: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone 16E</a> – the replacement for the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 brought Apple Intelligence support to the entry-level iPhone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>March: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2595313/ipad-air-2025-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air M3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">A16 iPad</a> launched on March 4 and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air M4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M4 Max Mac Studio</a> on March 5.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What else is expected in 2025? Various products haven’t been updated for a long time – specifically the Mac Pro (which never even got an M3 update). So an update to the Mac Pro is anticipated for 2025, perhaps at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC in June</a>, but what else is coming from Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the sections below we’ve split products into categories including Mac, iPad, iPhone, and some new product categories. Read on to find out what to expect at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple’s next event</a> and throughout 2025.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhones</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A new set of iPhones arrived at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s 2024 iPhone event</a> on September 9, and then the iPhone 16E arrived on February 19. What’s next for the iPhone? We can be pretty certain that a new iPhone will arrive in September 2025, as it always does.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air! </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 17 won’t arrive until September 2025, but there are already rumors about 2025’s iPhones. Apple is also expected to introduce a new model: the iPhone 17 Air which will bring a fresh design and new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 202</em>5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 Macs have arrived, so now Apple will be looking to role out the M5 chip. But there is one Mac still waiting for an M4: the Mac Pro. We assume Apple is developing the M4 Ultra for the Mac Pro and that it will arrive this year. Here’s what you can expect from the Mac lineup for the remainder of 2025:<em> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 Ultra Mac Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has updated the Mac Studio with an M4 Max, but the M4 Ultra update didn’t happen, instead Apple made an M3 Ultra chip just for the Mac Studio. So where does that leave the M4 Ultra Mac Pro? We assume that Apple is either experiencing difficulty with the M4 Ultra, or it has decided to further separate the Mac Studio and Mac Pro by reserving the very best chip for the Mac Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t expect Apple to change anything else with the M4 Ultra except for Thunderbolt 5 implementation. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">M4 Mac Pro rumors.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? June 2025 at WWDC</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M5 MacBook Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently work on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2599225/rumor-claims-an-m5-ipad-pro-and-macs-are-on-track-for-this-year.html\">M5 chip</a> was underway as early as January 2025 and the M5 MacBook Pro will be arriving at the end of 2025 (probably in October as usual). The iPad Pro may be the first to get the M5 chip though (more below). Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2552098/m5-macbook-pro-design-processor-specs-release.html\">M5 MacBook Pro: Everything you need to know</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? October 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M4 Ultra Mac Studio</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Studio was updated in March 2025 when it gained an M4 Max and an M3 Ultra chip. Will the Mac Studio get an M4 Ultra when the Mac Pro does? Probably not straight away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? TBC</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 iMac delivered some new color hues, but it still has a 24-inch screen. Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac way back in 2022 when the Studio Display arrived, and there have been rumors ever since that Apple is working on a new large-screen iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is said to be working on a new “Pro” version of the iMac, a return of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a> perhaps, or even larger. There are enough rumors to believe that Apple is indeed working on such an iMac, though it’s unclear whether it will arrive in 2025 or later. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Larger iMac Pro rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? TBC</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPads</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4315300_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost the whole iPad range got a refresh in 2024, with the new iPad Air and iPad Pro in May and the iPad mini in October. The iPad finally got an update in March 2025 (albeit a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">pointless one as it still doesn’t support Apple Intelligence</a>) and the iPad Air got upgraded to the M3 chip at the same time. So, what’s next? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M5 iPad Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M5 chip is, apparently, set to arrive in the iPad Pro in September 2025, a month before it arrives in the MacBook Pro. Although later rumors suggest that the update will come after the MacBook Pro… Perhaps both at the same time? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>September/October 2025</em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max and AirPods Pro have had the odd update since they launched a few years ago, but the next generation has yet to materialize. Will they get a full update in 2025?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait for new AirPods Pro could stretch beyond 2025. They could offer new health-related features when they arrive. As for the AirPods Max, now that Apple’s refreshed the colors it’s unlikely to do anything else for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 arrived in September 2024, with a sllightly larger screen, but there was no generational update for the Apple Watch Ultra or the Apple Watch SE. Apple will surely release a new Apple Watch in 2025 along with new Apple Watch Ultra and SE models. Some reports say Apple could move the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2458604/a-plastic-apple-watch-se-is-still-coming-next-year.html\">Apple Watch SE launch</a> to spring. The Apple Watch Ultra may gain the ability to send emergency texts via satellite. We could also see <a href=\"http://The%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%2010%20arrived%20in%20September%202024,%20with%20a%20larger%20screen,%20but%20there%20was%20no%20generational%20update%20for%20the%20Apple%20Watch%20Ultra%20or%20the%20Apple%20Watch%20SE.%20Apple%20will%20surely%20release%20a%20new%20Apple%20Watch%20in%202025%20along%20with%20new%20Apple%20Watch%20Ultra%20and%20SE%20models.%20Some%20reports%20say%20Apple%20could%20move%20the%20Apple%20Watch%20SE%20launch%20to%20spring.%20The%20Apple%20Watch%20Ultra%20may%20gain%20the%20ability%20to%20send%20emergency%20texts%20via%20satellite.%20We%20could%20also%20see%20https://www.macworld.com/article/2123009/apple-watch-series-10-health-features-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea.html\">blood pressure monitoring</a> on the new Watches in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2025, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod with screen</h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp\" alt=\"HomePod with iPad screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad_on_homepod-3.webp?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>A HomePod that combines the screen of an iPad could be on the cards.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker and control the HomePod via an iPhone (which can be a drain on the battery).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomeHub for the smart home </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Possibly connected to the HomePod with screen rumors are claims that Apple has big plans for the smart home and is working on a number of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomeHub related products</a>. One is said to be an iPad like smart displays that allow you to control your home devices vis HomeOS software. Another device is said to mount a camera on a robot arm that can follow you around! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Late 2025, 2026</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cheaper Vision Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro is pricy and a little cumbersome, but Apple is said to be at work on two updated models: a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-features-specs-price-faq.html\">cheaper Vision Pro</a>, and another high-end model. Perhaps “Vision Pro 2” and “Vision Air?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2489500/apples-vision-of-the-future-four-new-products-in-the-works.html\">four new AR/VR products</a> coming in 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.  These could include a cheaper Vision Pro model (at $2,000). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? TBC</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Car </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were hoping for a physical Apple Car prepare to be disappointed. Apple has cancelled the Apple Car project after about a decade of development. But this doesn’t mean there is no future for Apple’s car-related research. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second major iteration of CarPlay could takes things beyond maps and music to the next level, giving users complete control over things like climate control inside the car. Apple apparently wants to revolutionize the vehicle user interface and make it more user-friendly, convenient and functional. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2551293/whats-left-of-the-apple-car.html\">The Apple Car is dead.
