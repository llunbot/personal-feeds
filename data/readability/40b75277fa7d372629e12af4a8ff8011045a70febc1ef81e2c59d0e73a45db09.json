Bicycle Motocross (BMX) is raced on dirt or asphalt tracks with similar features on each — different elements ranging from rollers to jumps to berms.</p><p>Riders line up at the starting gate, and when it drops, they take off at full intensity looking for the fastest way around the track. With multiple riders racing at once, the races are short but packed with excitement with explosive speed, jostling for position, and the question of whether to roll, double, or even triple that next jump.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-768x432.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-696x392.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-1068x601.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-747x420.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb25 src ng ngcb25 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-768x432.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-696x392.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-1068x601.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bell-helmets-news-bob-haro-born-from-bmx-pic1-1400x787-copy-747x420.jpg 747w\"></a></p><p>After establishing the BMX Federation in 1981, the first World Championships was held the following year before BMX was fully integrated into the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1993.

The short race involves explosive power and cunning race tactics as each corner allows another rider to overtake and throw the previous off their line — this sometimes leads to crashes, but as they say, “rubbing is racing.” The finish is an all-out sprint, and in the Olympics — every spot counts, so these will be extra exciting from the first heat to the last.</p><p>The Riders’ race rankings are based on time and points. There are 24 competitors in the men’s and women’s events — Six riders compete in each of the four heats over three rounds, with the top 16 proceedings to the semi-final, the top eight competing in the final medal rounds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_265666\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-265666\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics-.jpeg\" alt=\"Rio Team USA BMX Racing Olympics\" width=\"1280\" height=\"676\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--297x157.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--800x423.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--120x63.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--768x406.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--696x368.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--1068x564.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--795x420.jpeg 795w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb25 src ng ngcb25 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics-.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--297x157.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--800x423.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--120x63.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--768x406.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--696x368.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--1068x564.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17122439/Rio-Team-USA-BMX-Racing-Olympics--795x420.jpeg 795w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-265666\">Photo credit: USA BMX</figcaption></figure><p>Though Team USA has been dominant, the Europeans, Australians, and Colombians are ready to take the gold this year.

Top-ranked Alise Willoughby of the USA, 2018 World Champion Laura Smulders from the Netherlands, and Australia’s Saya Sakakibara all stand in the way as fierce competitors though — it will be an exciting watch.</p><figure id=\"attachment_265668\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-265668\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle-.jpeg\" alt=\"Justin Dowell BMX Freestyle\" width=\"1280\" height=\"732\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--297x170.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--800x458.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--120x69.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--768x439.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--696x398.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--1068x611.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--734x420.jpeg 734w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb25 src ng ngcb25 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle-.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--297x170.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--800x458.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--120x69.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--768x439.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--696x398.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--1068x611.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17123244/Justin-Dowell-BMX-Freestyle--734x420.jpeg 734w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-265668\">Justin Dowell of the USA at former Hiroshima Municipal Stadium on April 21, 2019, in Hiroshima, Japan.

This BMX riding discipline is more of the X-Games style that most Americans are familiar with and is judged by 60-second runs where riders execute a sequence of tricks on ramps, walls, box jumps, and spines throughout the skate style park. The judges then grade the riders on the difficulty, quality, style, and originality of their runs.</p><p>For the Tokyo Olympics, there will be only nine men and nine women riders competing with the host nation Japan taking one of those spots. Despite the event being one of the smallest at the Olympic Games, it will be fiercely contested among the world’s top riders.<br>The competition will take place at the same venue as the BMX racing but at a different section of the Ariake Urban Sports Park.</p><h2>Olympic BMX Freestyle — Who to watch</h2><p>The BMX freestyle discipline is admittedly a bit out of my scope, so I reached out to the big guns to offer their opinions. Michael Potoczny from <a href=\"https://www.thewheelmill.com/\">The Wheel Mill</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/welcomejam/?hl=en\">The Welcome Jam</a> fame offered us his expert thoughts on who, and what to watch:</p><p><em>“I’m rooting for my boy Nick Bruce from Cleveland Ohio! But the Australian Logan Martin seems like the favorite right now. He’s the current world champ and his riding has been so consistent — yet huge.</em></p><p><em>For the women’s field, Hannah Robert’s of the USA has been dominating the last few years. She’s a multiple-time world champion. A lot of the women’s freestyle riders have been catching up to Hannah’s riding but I think she’s still going to have the upper hand and win this Olympics.</em></p><p><em>Hannah was on another level for years. It going to be a fun watch to see the women’s class and see everyone give her a run for her money. It’s going to be a really good contest.“</em></p><h2>Olympic BMX Competition — How To Watch</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/\">Catch all the racing on the Olympic Channel and NBC.</a></p><p><strong>Thursday, July 29</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 10:00 JST</li><li>Men’s BMX Quarterfinals</li><li>Women’s BMX Quarterfinals</li></ul><p><strong>Friday, July 30</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 10:00 JST</li><li>Men’s BMX Semifinals &amp; Finals</li><li>Women’s BMX Semifinals &amp; Finals</li></ul><h2>Olympic BMX Racing — Who To Watch from the USA</h2><h3>Olympic BMX Racing:</h3><p><strong>Men:</strong></p><ul><li>Connor Fields (Henderson, NV.; Chase Bicycles/ Monster Energy)</li><li>Corben Sharrah (Tucson, AZ.; Daylight Cycle Co.)</li></ul><p>Women:</p><ul><li>Payton Ridenour (Pottstown; PA; Mongoose Bicycles)</li><li>Felicia Stancil (Lake Villa, IL.; Factory Answer SSquared)</li><li>Alise Willoughby (Saint Cloud, MN.; Team Toyota/ GT Bicycles)</li></ul><h2>How To Watch Olympic BMX Free Style</h2><p><strong>Saturday, July 31</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 10:10 JST</li><li>Men’s BMX Freestyle Seeding</li><li>Women’s BMX Freestyle Seeding</li></ul><p><strong>Sunday, August 1</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Start Time:</strong> 10:10 JST</li><li>Men’s BMX Freestyle Finals</li><li>Women’s BMX Freestyle Finals</li></ul><h2>Olympic BMX Freestyle — Who To Watch from the USA</h2><h3>BMX Freestyle</h3><p><strong>Men:</strong></p><ul><li>Nick Bruce (Youngstown, OH)</li><li>Justin Dowell (Virginia Beach, VA.)</li></ul><p><strong>Women:</strong></p><ul><li>Perris Benegas (Reno, NV.)</li><li>Hannah Roberts (Buchanan, MI.)</li></ul><h2>Complete List of BMX athletes and countries</h2><h3>BMX Racing</h3><p><em>Coming Soon</em></p><h3>BMX Freestyle</h3><p><em>Coming Soon</em></p></div></div>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"40b75277fa7d372629e12af4a8ff8011045a70febc1ef81e2c59d0e73a45db09","category":"Cycling"}
