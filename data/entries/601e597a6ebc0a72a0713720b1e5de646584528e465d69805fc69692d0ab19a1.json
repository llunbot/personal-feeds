Managing director Richard Plugge will become CEO, while sports director Merijn Zeeman will be head coach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soudal-QuickStep’s CEO, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-boss-deceuninck-quickstep-manager-patrick-lefevere-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Lefevere</a>, would be on the new team’s supervisory board, in what looks on paper to be a demotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more pressing is what will happen to the riders. UCI regulations allow a maximum of 30 per team, but according to <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling</a> Jumbo-Visma currently have 27, while Soudal-QuickStep have 23. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means some twenty-odd riders will be out of contract – including some who will have just signed new agreements with their existing teams. A large number of soigneurs and other support staff could also find themselves out of a job for the same reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Jumbo-Visma reported to be the bigger partner in the new team and with most of the big names who will be fighting for selection, it seems likely that Soudal-QuickStep will come off worse. Rumours are already suggesting that just six QuickStep riders might make the cut (since this piece was written <a href=\"https://www.hln.be/wielrennen/live-lefevere-maakt-werk-van-opvangteam-voor-wie-niet-mee-kan-naar-visma-ploeg~a8808ba8/\" target=\"_blank\">Het Laatste Nieuws</a> has reported that Lefevere may be setting up another team that would hire the riders and staff that don’t find new jobs –<em>ed</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What have the reactions been?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/20230906VUE02034-UNIPUBLIC___CXCLING.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Luis Angel Gomez/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the higher-ups of both teams have stayed tight-lipped on the merger but some QuickStep riders have been less diplomatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviewed against the backdrop of the ongoing Italian classics, several riders have made it clear they’re not on board. Ilan Van Wilder won the Tre Valli Varesine on Tuesday, but rather than his unexpected triumph over Tadej Pogačar and other heavyweights, his post-victory speech focussed on his team’s uncertain future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s [been] difficult weeks for us, so this victory is really for my team-mates and for our staff, to show that we don’t agree with all this shit,’ he said. ‘We want to continue as Soudal-QuickStep. We are strong enough and I hope it will be like this.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>QuickStep talisman Julian Alaphilippe was another to comment, although in less explicit terms. ‘It’s sad above all. It [Soudal-QuickStep] has been a team for many years, and in the heart of cycling with a history behind it all,’ he said ahead of the Coppa Bernocchi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I find it sad, but we’re not there yet. We’re not going to cry. We’re here to race and we’re waiting for good news. We all hope, we don’t know anything, but look, there you go.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What seems clear is that few riders have much idea of what’s going on. Alaphilippe continued, ‘We don’t know much. It’s a bit complicated for everyone.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remco Evenepoel, QuickStep’s star rider, seems to have been taken by surprise too. His father commented outside a game at Anderlecht football stadium, ‘We are shocked, Remco too.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year the team has largely focussed its resources – more limited than Jumbo-Visma’s – around his stage race and Grand Tour hopes. Whether a new superteam mostly controlled by his former rivals would give him the same priority is another question entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will Soudal-Visma look like?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-970x646.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Jumbo-Visma-and-Soudal-QuickStep-by-Dario-BelingheriGetty-Images.jpg 1654w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Primoz Roglič’s imminent departure to Bora-Hansgrohe, with financial help from Red Bull, will have slightly lessened the new superteam’s headache. But its roster will still include three Grand Tour winners, including two out of three of this year’s champions in Jonas Vingegaard, Sepp Kuss, and Evenepoel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tension between those stars was evident at the Vuelta a España, where Vingegaard and Roglič were forced to put aside their own red jersey ambitions to support Sepp Kuss – to their visible annoyance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumbo-Visma attempted to downplay any possible rifts within the team. But the double- or triple-leader strategy seemed destined to fail from day one, and Roglič’s departure is unlikely to solve the problem as he will be replaced by another Vuelta winner in Evenepoel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to the selection nightmare, the team will also feature all-rounder Wout van Aert, who was frequently forced to put his own ambitions for stage wins on hold at this year’s Tour in order to protect Vingegaard. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-retirement-delay\">Mark Cavendish delays retirement to race for one more year in 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-peter-sagan\">Pro Log: Primož Roglič to leave Jumbo-Visma, Arnaud De Lie wins Famenne Ardenne Classic with one leg, Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig takes Giro dell’Emilia, Peter Sagan bows out from road racing</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-boss-deceuninck-quickstep-manager-patrick-lefevere-profile\">The boss: Deceuninck-QuickStep manager Patrick Lefevere profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>How will other teams react? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02193048/tadej_pogacar_and_jonaas_vingegaard_by_michael_steele_via_getty_-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tadej_pogacar_and_jonaas_vingegaard_by_michael_steele_via_getty_\" /><figcaption>Michael Steele via Getty </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With Ineos Grenadiers struggling to mount a sustained GC campaign at the moment and UAE Team Emirates reliant on star rider Pogačar, the merged team will likely exert even more of a stranglehold over the Grand Tour podium places. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another possibility is that Ineos and other teams will poach the QuickStep castoffs. With the merged team dominated by Jumbo-Visma riders who will stay under contract, the QuickStep riders will essentially become free agents – whose contracts will need paying off. It means that giants like Evenepoel, who has been rumoured to be moving to Ineos all year, might now take the plunge to boost his GC ambitions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fabio Jakobsen’s confirmed move to DSM-Firmenich earlier this year also makes more sense, with his selection chances limited in a team that already boasts Van Aert, Laporte, and Tour of Britain star Olav Kooij. Tim Merlier, who had been set to be Quick-Step’s main sprinter, will now find himself battling for a spot in the team and likely wishing he’d moved elsewhere too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens now? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-970x646.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/AG-Insurance-by-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters.jpg 1654w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the team’s own riders, whose fates now hang in the balance, the new superteam will have knock-on effects on the rest of the WorldTour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former UCI president Brian Cookson said, ‘It would be in everybody’s interest if there are stronger teams existing in the UCI WorldTour, rather than one mega mega strong team. I think it’s imbalanced enough as it is at the moment.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI have said little on the prospect, but have reportedly been informed and have commented that any merger would need to abide by existing licence rules. No company can have more than one WorldTour licence, meaning a space would be freed up for another team at the top level of men’s cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relegated teams like Israel-Premier Tech or Lotto-Dstny have already been granted wildcards to WorldTour level races but another wildcard would be handed out, likely to Scandinavian team Uno-X, who impressed at this year’s Tour de France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several other teams appear to have put their transfer business on hold while they wait for confirmation of which riders will lose out in the merger. Ongoing contract talks for other young or inexperienced riders may fall through as bosses look to snap up the casualties of Soudal-Visma instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Question marks are also there over the future of the women’s teams, AG Insurance-Soudal-QuickStep and Jumbo-Visma – who have also remained quiet so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further complicating matters, Jumbo are reportedly pulling out of the team, despite its incredible successes over the past few years – so where the new superteam’s financial backing comes from remains up in the air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the wait continues for an official announcement, speculation is rife on what the merger would mean for elite cycling. One thing seems certain – it’s a move that will shake up the peloton and likely usher in a new era of road dominance.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/jumbo-quick-step-merger\">What the Jumbo-QuickStep megateam means for pro cycling – and who loses out</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"fclifford","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"601e597a6ebc0a72a0713720b1e5de646584528e465d69805fc69692d0ab19a1","category":"Cycling"}
