Among the patents cited are <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US9421713B2/en\">US9421713B2</a>, \"Additive manufacturing method for printing three-dimensional parts with purge towers,\" and <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US9592660B2/en\">US9592660B2</a>, \"Heated build platform and system for three-dimensional printing methods.\"</p>\n<p>There are not many, if any, 3D printers sold to consumers that do not have a heated bed, which prevents the first layers of a model from cooling during printing and potentially shrinking and warping the model. \"Purge towers\" (or \"<a href=\"https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/parameter/prime-tower\">prime towers</a>\" in Bambu's parlance) allow for multicolor printing by providing a place for the filament remaining in a nozzle to be extracted and prevent bleed-over between colors. Stratasys' infringement claims also target some fundamental technologies around force detection and fused deposition modeling (FDM) that, like purge towers, are used by other 3D-printer makers that target entry-level and intermediate 3D-printing enthusiasts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042499#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042499&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05c91b9bf315974563cf47385e4007d76e95b45c2523e0c5d33bc9e1688d3484","category":"Tech"}
