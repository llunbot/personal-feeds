Introduced in 1972, it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhd7FfGCdCo\">a table tennis game</a> featuring very simple graphics and gameplay. In fact, it's simple enough that even non-living materials known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogel\">hydrogels</a> can \"learn\" to play the game by \"remembering\" previous patterns of electrical stimulation, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00436-3\">new paper</a> published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science.</p>\n<p>\"Our research shows that even very simple materials can exhibit complex, adaptive behaviors typically associated with living systems or sophisticated AI,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1055131?\">said co-author Yoshikatsu Hayashi</a>, a biomedical engineer at the University of Reading in the UK. \"This opens up exciting possibilities for developing new types of 'smart' materials that can learn and adapt to their environment.\"</p>\n<p>Hydrogels are soft, flexible biphasic materials that swell but do not dissolve in water. So a hydrogel may contain a large amount of water but still maintain its shape, making it useful for a wide range of applications. Perhaps the best-known use is soft contact lenses, but various kinds of hydrogels are also used in breast implants, disposable diapers, EEG and ECG medical electrodes, glucose biosensors, encapsulating quantum dots, solar-powered water purification, cell cultures, tissue engineering scaffolds, water gel explosives, actuators for soft robotics, supersonic shock-absorbing materials, and sustained-release drug delivery systems, among other uses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044726#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5191339dca35aa657352adfa3b33faf8eab2efcb64e3db3fd529618591ac40ba","category":"Tech"}
