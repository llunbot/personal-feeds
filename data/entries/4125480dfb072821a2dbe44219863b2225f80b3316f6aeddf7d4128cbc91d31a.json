{"title":"Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame Inducts Second Class","link":"https://bikerumor.com/gravel-hall-of-fame-2nd/","date":1680529959000,"content":"<p>Exciting news out of Emporia, Kansas! The <a href=\"https://www.gravelcyclinghof.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame</a> inducted its second class in a ceremony on March 31. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s class includes Yuri Hauswald, Miguel Crawford, Alison Tetrick, and Joel Dyke. The four were chosen from among hundreds of nominations by an election committee of over 50 industry luminaries (including current Hall of Fame members).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>About the inductees</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gravelcyclinghof.com/hall-of-famers-2023/yuri-hauswald\" target=\"_blank\">Yuri Hauswald</a> is an athlete with three decades of cycling experience who has also been instrumental in founding and fostering some of gravel’s most iconic events. <a href=\"https://www.gravelcyclinghof.com/hall-of-famers-2023/miguel-crawford\" target=\"_blank\">Miguel Crawford</a> founded the Grasshopper Adventure Series, a collection of events that have influenced gravel’s spirit since the late 90s. And <a href=\"https://www.gravelcyclinghof.com/hall-of-famers-2023/alison-tetrick\" target=\"_blank\">Alison Tetrick</a> is an accomplished athlete, but secured her place thanks to “her contributions off the bike to the sport and community,” according to the Hall of Fame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final inductee is the late <a href=\"https://www.gravelcyclinghof.com/hall-of-famers-2023/joel-dyke\" target=\"_blank\">Joel Dyke</a>: frame builder and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.unboundgravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Unbound Gravel</a>. By inducting him, the Hall of Fame hopes to honor Dyke’s legacy of insisting that gravel shouldn’t fall prey to self-seriousness. </p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqK-VF4syJh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <p></p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqK-VF4syJh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqK-VF4syJh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqK-VF4syJh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqK-VF4syJh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CqK-VF4syJh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Gravel Cycling Hall Of Fame (@gravelcyclinghof)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<p>“Joel always felt cycling should be about the fun,” his wife Michelle wrote in Dyke’s biography on the Hall of Fame website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rocky-mountain-carbon-solo-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel</a> hasn’t been around long enough to have a hall of fame — think again. Cyclists have been grinding bumpy doubletrack since bicycles were a thing. After all, most of the world’s roads were dirt in the 1850s. That spirit of gravel is especially strong in Emporia: the current home of Unbound Gravel and the future physical home of the Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.gravelcyclinghof.com/\" target=\"_blank\">gravelcyclinghof.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gravel-hall-of-fame-2nd/\">Gravel Cycling Hall of Fame Inducts Second Class</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Andrew Marshall","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4125480dfb072821a2dbe44219863b2225f80b3316f6aeddf7d4128cbc91d31a","category":"Cycling"}
