Both children were hospitalized in Lubbock and had been discharged.</p>\n<p>As of mid-day February 7, the outbreak total reached nine confirmed measles cases in the <a href=\"https://southplainshealth.org/measles-exposure-page/\">South Plains Public Health District</a> (SPPHD) that includes Gaines, according to Zach Holbrooks, Executive Director for SSPHD. In an interview with Ars, Holbrooks reported that there were three additional probable cases that are linked to the confirmed cases. These are cases in the same household or family—maybe a cousin or sibling—that are showing measles symptoms but haven't been tested yet or gotten their test results back yet, Holbrooks said. So far, there have been no other reports of hospitalizations besides those in the first two cases.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"378acec25c53fbd817aa829da28d330939c65f8323ec46eac0173111d2a735b8","category":"Tech"}
