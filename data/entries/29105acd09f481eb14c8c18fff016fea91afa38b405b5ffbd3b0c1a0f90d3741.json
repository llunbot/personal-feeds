Yet it’s fully modern with 35mm tire clearance, stealth routing, and a generous rider weight limit. In other words, it’s an ultralight bike that’s meant to be ridden hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ari says the Suncrest rides like a great road racing bike should, with efficient power transfer and sharp handling. But the layup adds a little forgiveness, making it a “road cyclist’s road bike” that also deliver a “smooth &amp; responsive” ride quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2.jpg\" alt=\"ari suncrest lightweight road bike being ridden.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also compatible with all mechanical drivetrains and SRAM AXS &amp; Shimano Di2 electronic drivetrains. Keep it 2x or go 1x, it works either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> It comes with their replaceable road-specific, UDH-like rear derailleur hanger, which works with any size road cassette. In a pinch, you can swap in a SRAM UDH hanger, but those are only officially compatible with cassettes down to a 28-tooth large cog (UDH was previously listed with a larger minimum, but SRAM has revised their specifications).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other key features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-4.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of ari suncrest road bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-4.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-ari-suncrest-lightweight-road-bike-4-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike uses a 1.5″ to 1.5″ head tube to make room for brake hoses and any shift cables to enter through the headset cap and slide next to the steerer tube for semi-stealth routing. It’s compatible with FSA’s ACR system if you want to swap out the stem and bar and go full stealth.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2421\" height=\"1315\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart.jpg\" alt=\"geometry chart for ari suncrest road bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart.jpg 2421w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart-297x161.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart-1536x834.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart-768x417.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ari-suncrest-geometry-chart-2048x1112.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry is “race fit” to put the rider in a low, aerodynamic, powerful pedaling position.
