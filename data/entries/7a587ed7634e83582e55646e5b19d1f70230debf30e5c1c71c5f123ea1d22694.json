This, the 31st edition, runs from Annemasse to Morzine, a facsimile of the Tour’s Stage 14. With over 4,100m of climbing in 157km, it’s one of the hardest Étapes in years.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Etape du Tour 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>My excitement for this ride is entirely in proportion to the Étape itself. I love events like this, with a spectacular route and the opportunity to be as racy or as casual as you like. As for me, I’m more than a little competitive and I enjoy the whole project of optimising every detail towards a target event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden the Étape once before, in 2011. I’m much fitter now, so I set myself a target of finishing in the top 200 this year and I have trained hard for it. That’s what events like this mean to me; if you, on the other hand, prefer to take your time, pillage every feed stop, take photos and enjoy the views, I understand that completely too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a smattering of decent gran fondo results to my name, I was given a place in the first wave of riders… a ‘wave’ of 1,000, which is the size of the entire field at many other events. Job one, then, is to move up the field. The race – and it is a race when so many people are racing – starts fast, which stretches the field early and creates the room to make up ground. A few other riders have the same idea so I’m able to follow a wheel at times, even if doing so still requires plenty of effort. Like I said, fast. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Etape du Tour 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When positioning is so important, I don’t see this as energy spent, rather as energy invested. Or maybe gambled. Still, I’m willing to risk detonation in pursuit of the best possible result. My pacing strategy is along the lines of ‘get rich or die trying’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first climb, the mild Col de Saxel (4.2km, 4.6%), goes by in a big ring blur while scrapping for position. The Col de Cou (7km, 7.7%) comes next and the group I am in – the third on the road, I think – agrees an <em>entente cordiale</em>… at 300-plus watts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This climb’s minor celebrity encounter is YouTuber and Skoda ambassador Cameron Jeffers. As he’s an Elite racer, descending with him is an exhilarating experience. In fact, the overall standard of riding is very high throughout the first wave and I don’t witness a single moment of choppy riding. Combined with the closed roads – and obviously the incredible scenery and terrain – it makes the riding extremely enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape du Tour 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Off the descent and into the Col du Feu (5.8km, 7.6%), I find myself off the front of the group and decide to press on, bridging to a small group of about 20 just in time to rail the descent and then profit from sharing the work on the Col de Jambaz (6.8km, 3.8%), a mild, big-ring climb. It’s an ideal place to be going into the two huge final climbs of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By this point, though, the effort is starting to pinch and I know I have to get my pacing and nutrition right from here on. In terms of the latter, I’m using Maurten energy drink and have bottles waiting at the two Sportive Breaks private feeds, along with notes that I’ll be racing the event and would really love some quick service. I call out as I approach the tent but as I skid to a stop the guy on duty is still sunbathing in a chair and my bag is somewhere in a pile. By the time I find it and grab my bottles, I’ve lost 45 seconds and the group I’ve been riding in has disappeared into the distance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The descent of the Jambaz is a really bad place to end up on your own. It’s 20km long but at just 2.6% gradient, so a group has a massive advantage and is able to move faster while still allowing most of the riders to coast and rest. On the other hand, riding solo means I have to pedal firmly the whole way – not so much energy spent as energy written off.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Etape du Tour 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>My legs are still decent on the Col de la Ramaz (13.9km, 7.1%) and the sustainable power has only faded slightly. Incredibly, the second Sportive Breaks feed is just as dopey as the first, despite me hollering from 200m away, though this time at least the time penalty isn’t as big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The descent of the Ramaz is the highlight of the entire ride. Having ridden it yesterday to prepare, I learned some critical details that let me confidently stay off the brakes. Best of all is the S-bend through a tunnel halfway down, taken at full speed with big lean, a level of commitment only possible at the Étape with its closed roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the valley, the group comes back together and I find myself chatting with a very affable American called Boz. It turns out this is Ian Boswell, former pro roadie turned pro gravel rider. The group gives me a near-free ride to the official feed zone, where I refill my bottles and squirt some cooling water over my torso and legs for some short-lived relief from the heat.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape du Tour 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Col de Joux Plane is, frankly, a horror show. It’s so steep and brutally punishes anyone whose energies are fading. Today, that’s almost everyone, including me. Small cramps are a near-constant – even in my hands – and the suffering is immense. I feel like I’m being barbecued and someone is sticking knives in my legs to test if they’re done. My chest is tightening and I’m afraid of a big asthma attack, as happens occasionally when I go this deep. The kilometres tick down in slow motion and even at 2km to go I’m not sure I’ll make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the finish gantry less than 100m away, an increase in pace makes every muscle in my legs cramp so hard I nearly fall off the bike. For having pushed so hard, cracked, and then pushed as hard as possible through the crumbled ruins of my energies, this is as much as I’ve suffered for years. Despite that, I can only grin as I cross the line in Morzine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My official time to the top of the Joux Plane (where timing is taken for safety reasons) is 5h 16min, which puts me around 104<sup>th</sup> overall, and seventh in my age group – a deeply satisfying result. Chapeau to everyone who took part, especially Martina Sablikova and Artus Jaladeau, women’s and men’s winners respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many high-profile and well established sportives, including the UCI Gran Fondo World Championships, and I’m fortunate to have ridden a bunch of them, but none can challenge the crown of L’Étape.

You avoid slow bus transfers, often at awkward times, you can take a lot more kit and spares, your bike can’t get lost or damaged, and there’s no risk of making an error reassembling it – I heard of a rider whose rear mech fell off and went in his wheel, ending his ride after just 4km, after he had flown in from Canada. You will also be able to recon the course, see more of the area, and make your own way to the start. When the bus left our chalet at 4:30am, my alarm had not yet gone off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Take spares of everything, including riding kit. Prep your bike very thoroughly or have a shop do it. Research the course carefully and ensure you have appropriate gearing, remembering that it’s better to be under-geared than over.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape du Tour 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>• Take your own breakfast to make the morning easy. I recommend preparing a simple bowl of overnight oats in your room (around 150g of dry oats, drowned in oat milk, left covered overnight) so that it’s ready to eat. It saves time going to the hotel breakfast and you get what you need, rather than what they have. Get a double espresso the night before, leave it next to the oats and drink it cold as soon as you wake so it hits your empty stomach. It will get you sharp, obviously, but also triggers other natural movements, the timing of which may not be ideal when starting a ride at 7am. On that note, take toilet paper and baby wipes to the start area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Train hard. Then train harder, aiming to do a similarly hard ride to the Étape (hours of effort, not necessarily mountainous) at least twice in training around five and three weeks out. The many free training plans floating around rarely get you to do this, so it’s no wonder the event ends up feeling incredibly hard. Taper right off in the last two weeks to make sure you’re fresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Ideally, plan to arrive two days before so you can have an easy, relaxed day before the event with a leg-opener ride and two good nights’ sleep. Take ear plugs to be sure of the latter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Pace yourself, eat and drink lots, be hyper-aware of everyone around you and ride considerately and safely. Enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The rider’s ride: Factor O2 VAM</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Etape du Tour 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/etape-du-tour-2023-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption><em>Factor O2 VAM, 6.2kg</em>. </figcaption><figcaption>Chris Storrar</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/factor-o2-vam-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Factor’s new O2 VAM</a> was designed for exactly this purpose – going as fast as possible over a mountainous route, whether in the hands of amateurs on events such as the Étape or professionals in Grand Tours. It’s astonishingly good. In fact, I’m convinced that I have the best bike of anyone here. At 6.2kg and on super-light, carbon-spoked wheels, it climbs brilliantly. But it’s also a rocket downhill, a bobsled in the corners, a TGV express train on the flat, and super-stiff in a sprint effort. It’s a jet fighter of a bike and the best thing I’ve ever ridden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The rider’s kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all super-light stuff that I’ve used a lot in the mountains on hot days and have total faith in.
