And while Windows and Linux both support some level of x86-to-Arm app translation that attempts to maintain compatibility with most software, there are still plenty of things that demand an Intel or AMD processor with the x86 instruction set.</p>\n<p>Last week, Parallels <a href=\"https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-20-2-0/\">released a new update</a> that partially resolves this problem: Users of Parallels Desktop Pro 20.2.0 now have access to x86 operating systems via an \"early technology preview\" of Parallels' \"proprietary emulation engine.\"</p>\n<p>The technology preview is currently limited to certain 64-bit versions of Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2019 and 2022. Parallels also says it has tested several UEFI-compatible Linux distributions, including Ubuntu 22.04.5, Kubuntu 24.04.1, Lubuntu 24.04.1, and Debian versions 12.4 to 12.8. Fedora will install, but it's unstable. 32-bit versions of operating systems, as well as older versions of Windows like Windows 7 or 8, aren't supported.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/parallels-desktop-gains-really-slow-support-for-x86-oses-on-apple-silicon/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/parallels-desktop-gains-really-slow-support-for-x86-oses-on-apple-silicon/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bcce06c336821bf1b21d66e65154a737ee738e543cc34440dcb178c5c72cc6c4","category":"Tech"}
