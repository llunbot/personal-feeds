Archaeologists are hailing the find as one of the most significant mosaics yet found in Great Britain, and the entire site has been declared a protected area. It will be featured next year on the British documentary TV series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digging_for_Britain\"><em>Digging for Britain</em></a>.</p>\n<p>This isn't the first interesting archaeological find from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain\">Roman occupation of Britain</a>. For instance, back in 2018, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/08/climate-change-brings-the-uks-hidden-past-to-the-surface/\">we reported</a> that archaeologists flying over a prehistoric settlement in southern Wales had spotted the ghostly outline of a Roman villa on the ground inside a known older prehistoric settlement’s boundaries.
