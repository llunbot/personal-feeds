One of the neat things about SpaceX's privately-owned South Texas launch site, named Starbase, is the public can approach within a few hundred feet of the rocket. The surrounding mud flats, dunes, and beach are all public land.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985143#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985143&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f62ad084275aec3e88d02e4a55bb27a2d8c5ba4dfc280e87174d0d4b3c2fc27","category":"Tech"}
