{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro Pre-Orders Off to Promising Start With Strong Early Demand, Says Analyst","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/iphone-13-preorder-demand/","date":1632149986000,"content":"While it has been many years since Apple stopped providing first weekend sales numbers for new iPhones, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty today said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/iphone-13-models-now-available-for-pre-order/\">iPhone 13 Pro pre-orders</a> are \"off to a promising start\" with \"strong early demand.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPhone-13-Pro-Feature-Blue.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nHuberty based her opinion off of Apple's delivery estimates for iPhones, which she has been tracking for many years. Shortly after pre-orders began last Friday, delivery estimates for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/iphone-13-preorders-already-slipping/\">began slipping into October</a>, with Huberty having calculated the average lead time at around 27 days. She said this is the second longest lead time on the first day of pre-orders amongst all iPhone models launched over the past five years, surpassed only by the iPhone X in 2017.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs of last Friday, Huberty said the iPhone 13 mini was faring better with a lead time of 3.1 days, while the standard iPhone 13 faced no delays.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with every iPhone launch, it is possible that lengthy delivery estimates are a function of low supply rather than high demand, but Huberty said Morgan Stanley's supply chain checks indicate minimal near-term component headwinds for iPhones and concluded that these long lead times \"are at least partly a function of strong early demand.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 24. Key features across the iPhone 13 lineup include a faster A15 Bionic chip, camera improvements, longer battery life, and a smaller notch. The two Pro models also feature a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/katy-huberty/\">Katy Huberty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/morgan-stanley/\">Morgan Stanley</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/iphone-13-preorder-demand/\">iPhone 13 Pro Pre-Orders Off to Promising Start With Strong Early Demand, Says Analyst</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-pro-pre-orders-off-to-promising-start-with-strong-early-demand-says-analyst.2312024/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qi2lCdGHz40:jX0IH2CNpXI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qi2lCdGHz40:jX0IH2CNpXI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Qi2lCdGHz40\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ccfab33b1bcbc050c306a19830e8b83c17837f586a9cef522dfc50632571e24b","category":"Apple"}
