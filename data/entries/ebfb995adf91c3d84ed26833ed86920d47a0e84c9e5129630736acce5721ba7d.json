The customer can then tap on the email attachment in the Mail app and add the order to the Wallet app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Pay-Order-Tracking-Email.jpg\" alt width=\"1628\" height=\"916\" />\r<br />\nApple has also introduced a new \"Track with Apple Wallet\" button that merchants can add within their iPhone apps and websites.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Track-with-Apple-Wallet.jpg\" alt width=\"1628\" height=\"914\" />\r<br />\nAs previously announced by Apple, iPhone users will be able to present a driver's license or ID stored in the Wallet app <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/apple-wallet-iphone-ids-at-businesses/\">at participating businesses and venues</a> starting later this year.
