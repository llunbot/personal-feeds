It ended on Monday with the announcement\nof new MacBook Pro models that roll back most of the major changes\nintroduced in 2016, putting the MacBook Pro in a new state of\ngrace that recalls the middle of the last decade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, this tidbit on maximum charging speeds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Here’s a quirk of the new MacBook Pros. On the 14-inch models,\nthe larger 96W USB-C power adapter is required for fast charging.\nYou can fast charge either via MagSafe or via a standard USB-C\ncable attached to that adapter. However, on the 16-inch models — all of which come with a 140W adapter — you can only do\nultra-fast charging via MagSafe. While there’s a new specification\nthat allows for much higher power delivery levels over USB ports,\nthe Thunderbolt 4/USB 3 ports on the MacBook Pro don’t support it.\nYou can still charge via those ports, of course — just not at the\nultra-fastest speed.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/19/exile-from-dongletown\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8a8757b0c0782aae4c2b3ba5e8334f5f98d8df3eafd2124a61746fc5805ca4da","category":"Tech"}
