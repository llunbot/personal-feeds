However, if you live somewhere with long, snowy winters it may also mean fat biking time! Panorama Cycles is based in Quebec, Canada, where winters are long enough that you’ve got to embrace it and get outside or you’ll go stir-crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Panorama has been around for nine years, and is focused on producing adventure bikes. The new Chic-Chocs 3 is the third generation of this fat bike model, named after the Chic-Choc mountains in Quebec. Aside from offering compatibility for rigid or suspension forks, the Chic-Chocs 3 is available as a frameset or a complete bike with plenty of custom build options to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Panorama Cycles Chic-Chocs 3:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Chic-Chocs 3, frame closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-frame-closeup-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chic-Chocs 3 is built around a carbon frame, which Panorama says is lightweight but strategically reinforced. A curved top tube keeps the standover height low, and the seat tube is kept short above the top tube to maximize clearance for long-travel dropper posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Panorama’s builds come with 27.5” wheels and 4.5” tires, but the frame and fork can accept 29×3” or 26×5” tires if preferred. Suspension-corrected geometry allows for rigid or suspension fork options. Panorama offers either their rigid carbon fork or a Manitou Mastodon EXT 120mm fork upgrade option.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Chic-Chocs 3, trailside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-trailside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chic-Chocs 3 features a narrow crank axle for a fatbike. Panorama says its 203-205mm Q-factor is the smallest possible with 27.5×4.5” tires (depending on the chosen crankset). Hydraulic disc brakes with 180mm front and 160mm rear rotors handle stopping duties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chic-Chocs 3 frame features sleeved internal cable routing and SRAM UDH-compatible dropouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small frames come with 125mm dropper posts, mediums come with 150mm and larges get 170mm posts. Panorama notes the frames can fit longer travel posts, but the collar may sit a little above the seat tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-in-frame-storage.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-in-frame-storage.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Chic-Chocs 3, in-frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-in-frame-storage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-in-frame-storage-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-in-frame-storage-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-in-frame-storage-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Storage is key for long-distance adventure rides and bikepacking excursions, so the Chic-Chocs 3 features in-frame storage. The compartment is in the frame’s down tube, and a tool bag is included with each frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Chic-Chocs 3, packed up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-packed-up-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to in-frame storage, the frame and fork offer 18 mounting points for bags, racks, etc. There are three water bottle mounts on the seat mast, the underside of the down tube, and the top of the down tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-1.webp\"><img width=\"595\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-1.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Chic-Chocs 3, geo 1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-1.webp 595w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-1-297x273.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-1-120x110.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-2.webp\"><img width=\"598\" height=\"171\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-2.webp\" alt=\"Panorama Cycles Chic-Chocs 3, geo 2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-2.webp 598w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-2-297x85.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panorama-Cycles-Chic-Chocs-3-geo-2-120x34.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chic-Chocs 3 was designed with modern geometry, aiming to feel agile on climbs but stable on descents.

Reach numbers are 430mm for smalls, 455mm for mediums, and 480mm for large. The chainstay length for all frame sizes is 450mm.
