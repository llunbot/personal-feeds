{"title":"Teslagrad 2","link":"https://neizod.dev/2023/04/22/teslagrad-2.html","date":1682123460000,"content":"<p>A game never learn from their mistakes a decade ago…</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"/images/game/cover/teslagrad-2.jpg\" alt /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The good side first: great art, lovely character, intrigue world-building, and speechless storytelling!</p>\n\n<p>But that’s not what make (any) game become a good game. No. Games need “gameplay” in order to make it memorable/enjoyable!</p>\n\n<p>And that’s what lack from this title.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, the core idea of the game that explore “electromagnetic” mechanic is charming. Build a platforming world with north/south magnetic field here and there, while let the player to switch on/off their character became a psudo-magnetic object in order to solve the puzzle. Sound fun and challenging and have a lot of potential interesting levels. Implementing it right and the game might join the greatest puzzles of all time club (notable members: Fez, Portal, Baba is You, Patrick’s Parabox, etc).</p>\n\n<p>However, this game ruin the opportunity. Even with the second chance.</p>\n\n<p>The magnetic mechanic itself is so clunky! Yes, the physics was implemented realistically, e.g., jumping is projectile. But does the game <em>really</em> need that realistic aspect, like putting realistic first and player intention later (not to mention that the control is not tight at all)? Combined with the continuously coordination and curved platforming everywhere, now each jump is crucial since a slightly different initial angle/position result in huge different outcome momentum. Which the game take a sadistic path that require you to make perfect jump and maintain correct momentum multiple times in a row.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a room in this game is too large with too less checkpoints. A misjump at the last part of the platforming section will cost you a minute, because now you need to redo everything from start of the room, again.</p>\n\n<p>The annoying platforming is one thing. But boss fights take the frustration to another level.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, you have 1 HP.</p>\n\n<p>Really? In 2023??? When other games in the industry concern about accessibility and have option to subdued these frustrations, let player enjoy the game the way they like. (And, maybe, after they beat the game once, they might comeback for the intentional experience later!)</p>\n\n<p>Duck, even Dark Souls allows mistakes!!!</p>\n\n<p>Bosses also have no HP-bar (we all know that each boss have 3 HP in this game). The only indicator is embedded in the visual representation of the boss (like, there are 3 locks on the boss character, dealing a damage removes a lock). This design might looked immersion, however in this game it’s only bring frustration. That is you will never be sure if you have dealt the damage successfully onto the boss. So good luck with the moose boss, which is only the second one in the game.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Honestly, whose the target audience of this amazing world-building but punishing gameplay?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You like platforming? Then Celeste will teach you what is tight control.</li>\n  <li>You like mind-blowing puzzle? Baba is You, Patrick’s Parabox, Stephen’s Sausage Roll!</li>\n  <li>You like sit-back-and-relax metroidvania? Try Toki Tori 2+.</li>\n  <li>You like epic-boss-fight metroidvania? Metroid, Castlevania, Hollow Knight.</li>\n  <li>You like a combination of all above? Definitely Tunic!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don’t understand why the developer <em>must</em> develop a game this <em>frustrating</em> (in a bad way). I don’t wanna even use the word “hard” or “challenging”, because the game is unforgivably difficult to the point that it is not fair to play the game anymore.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you enjoy torturing yourself, like playing Getting Over It (by yourself, not just watching YouTuber screaming in pain). Then this game might be perfect for you.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"neizod's speculation","siteHash":"939338c5557b1743f2c128736c6006e145dcabc81da9970f1c0dc8ae2feb0830","entryHash":"05ce440fa9fcd9821b3f594bb2f79c7c40bd2a76ed3fa41dc74d7da3cef2b7dc","category":"Thai"}
