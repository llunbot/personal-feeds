[…]</p>\n\n<p>In terms of infections, fully vaccinated people were about 11\ntimes less likely to get an infection in the pre-delta period,\ncompared with the unvaccinated (with a 95 percent confidence\ninterval of 7.8 to 15.8). That ratio dropped to 4.6 less likely in\nthe post-delta period (with a 95 percent confidence interval of\n2.5 to 8.5).</p>\n\n<p>For hospitalizations prior to delta, fully vaccinated people were\n13 times less likely to wind up in the hospital than the\nunvaccinated (confidence interval of 11.3 to 15.6). After delta,\nthat ratio dropped slightly to 10 times less likely (confidence\ninterval of 8.1 to 13.3). The fully vaccinated were 16.6 times\nless likely to die of COVID-19 prior to delta (confidence interval\nof 13.5 to 20.4) and 11.3 times less likely to die after delta\n(confidence interval of 9.1 to 13.9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Donald McNeil — the award-winning science reporter formerly of The New York Times — <a href=\"https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/what-is-biden-waiting-for-193df3fb4ac9\">writing a month ago</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Confusion about mask rules is now so great that enforcement\nanywhere but on airplanes will be impossible. Requiring weekly\ntests as a substitute for vaccination is doomed to fail because\nthe Delta variant can turn someone from healthy to superspreader\nin <a href=\"https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2021/07/are-things-different-delta\">less than four days</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The key to saving lives is vaccine. The key to reopening offices\nand factories is vaccine. The key to reopening schools is vaccine.\nThe key to keeping bars and restaurants open in cold weather is\nvaccine. The key to travel and shopping is vaccine.
