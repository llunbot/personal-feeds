Apple's first foldable ‌iPhone‌ is expected to have a book-like design that folds horizontally, just like the Z Fold. The rumored pricing would make Apple's foldable around $200–$400 more expensive than Samsung's equivalent offering.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max starts at $1,199, but when configured with 1TB of storage that increases to $1,599. This means that Apple's first foldable will still be around $1,000 more expensive than the current flagship ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a growing number of insightful reports about Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">long-rumored foldable iPhone</a>; it is now expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">as soon as next year</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a mixed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">track record for Apple rumors</a>, but has provided some strikingly accurate information, such as the imminent launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">2023's Yellow iPhone 14</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/\">frosted back glass</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, the Apple Watch Series 9 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/\">as a minor refresh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/\">spatial video capture</a> on the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro, the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/\">landscape front-facing camera</a>, the M4 ‌iPad Pro‌'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/\">nano-texture display option</a>, the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-16-pro-battery-capacities/\">battery capacities</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/\">continued Apple Watch band compatibility</a> through the Apple Watch Series 10.
