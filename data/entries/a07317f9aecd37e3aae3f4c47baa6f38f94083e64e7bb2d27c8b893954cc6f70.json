Pete Skelton of Medusa Cycles knows this – that much is evident in his frame designs – but he also understands that functionality needn’t come at the expense of beauty and craftsmanship.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was raised around my dad’s steel race bikes,’ Skelton tells Cyclist. ‘I’ve never owned a car, so cycling has always been a necessity. As the years progressed I found myself drawn more and more to the utilitarian side of things.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skelton recalls three bikes that used to hang in his parents’ garage: a steel frame handbuilt by his dad, an MKM tourer with handpainted gold lug lining, and a Thompson race bike, complete with Campagnolo Record components and Clement Criterium Silk tubs. These are the bikes he credits with sparking his interest in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/frame-of-mind-inside-the-world-of-the-framebuilder\">framebuilding</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_062-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That race bike amazed me as a child,’ he says. ‘I couldn’t believe such a precise machine had been made by hand.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his 20s, Skelton worked at various bike shops and brands, and even completed an apprenticeship as a traditional coach painter. But it was ultimately a cycle trip across India that solidified his desire to build utilitarian bikes. On returning home he resolved to make Medusa Cycles a reality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I run Medusa from a compact workshop in Manchester,’ Skelton says. ‘I’ve been building and painting frames from here for about three years now, but I have my sights set on moving premises to somewhere with a bit more space and a dedicated paint booth. The setup I have now is ideal for building one frame at a time but I’m always thinking about how I could move things forward with Medusa Cycles when the time comes.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_051-scaled.webp 1707w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Deka is Skelton’s answer to gravel biking in the UK.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Most <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">gravel bikes</a> are designed for the smooth, wide roads of the American Midwest,’ he explains. ‘But here it’s rough bridleways and steep, loose climbs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘One route I particularly enjoy pedalling along is the Pennine Bridleway. I just love how you can pick it up in North Manchester and eventually find your way up to the top end of the Yorkshire Dales, riding off-road almost the entire way. But this route is quite rough so having the option to run tyres wider than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\">standard gravel size</a> of 45mm was a must. That being said, I still wanted something that wouldn’t feel completely out of its comfort zone when riding on paved surfaces.’ </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\">geometry</a> reflects this localised focus. The frame features a relatively short chainstay length and a steep seat angle for confident climbing, paired with a 700c wheelset for stability on rough descents. Wide tyre clearance – up to 55mm – ensures the bike can take the unpredictable surfaces in its stride.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It climbs with ease but feels planted on the way down,’ Skelton says.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building the frame this way wasn’t without its challenges: ‘Trying to make this chainstay length and tyre combo work while maintaining adequate chainring and mud clearance pushed me to think a little bit outside of the box.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skelton’s approach combines modern innovation with a nod to classic mountain bike designs of the 1990s. To achieve the Deka’s short chainstays while accommodating wide tyres, he drew inspiration from elevated chainstay configurations seen in vintage bikes such as the Alpinestars Mega and Nishiki Alien.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bespoked_Medusa_Pete_034-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I only raised the driveside chainstay to maintain <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-frame-stiffness\">stiffness</a> in the rear triangle,’ he explains. ‘I also remembered something that Neil Orrell [Manchester-based framebuilder] told me when explaining the reasoning behind joining the ends of the seatstays along the top tube, creating a “triple triangle” configuration. He told me how after he had taken one of his triple-triangle frames to a testing facility, he found there to be an increase in overall frame stiffness. This design element has also been used by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/gt-grade-carbon-pro-le-review\">GT bikes</a> for a long time. All this ties into another goal of building a bike that still feels adequately responsive, even with the larger 700c wheels and slim-diameter steel tubing.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of tubes, the Deka frame is constructed primarily from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/reynolds-men-of-steel\">Reynolds</a> tubing, including premium grade 853 Pro Team for the down tube and top tube, and 631 for the head tube. Stainless steel gussets at key junctions enhance durability while preventing corrosion.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Every detail is about ensuring the frame is as responsive and robust as possible,’ says Skelton. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Deka is a bike built for real-world adventures, with fully guided internal routing for dynamo cables and hydraulic lines keeping things clean and functional, while provisions for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">mudguards</a> and frame bags cater to bikepackers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I wanted it to be ready for anything, whether it’s an overnight trip or a quick ride on country lanes,’ Skelton says. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Deka frameset, including a Seido MGV fork, starts at £3,600 and includes custom sizing, paint and braze-ons. Complete builds vary depending on components, but a fully specced bike like the one featured here costs £8,600.
