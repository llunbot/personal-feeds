Over on our YouTube channel, Dan shared a review now that he's been able to spend some quality time with the machine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThe M3 ‌MacBook Air‌ is a perfect all-around laptop, and the Air models are what we recommend for most people. In fact, the M3 ‌MacBook Air‌ is more machine than the average consumer likely even needs. For web browsing, sending emails, and other simple tasks, a more affordable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> ‌MacBook Air‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> ‌MacBook Air‌ is more than enough, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/best-buy-macbook-air-all-time-low/\">M1 MacBook Air is even available</a> at a super low $650 price right now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor photo editing, video editing, and tasks that require a little more power, even the base model M3 ‌MacBook Air‌ with 8GB Unified Memory is more than enough for many people. Upgrading the memory will give you a bit more leeway in terms of future proofing, and adding more storage is a good idea if you need space for file storage, games, and apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to the ‌M2‌ ‌MacBook Air‌, the M3 has faster CPU and GPU speeds, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for 3D rendering and games, Wi-Fi 6E support, and support for two displays in clamshell mode. If you need these options, or don't mind shelling out a bit more money for a machine that will last longer, it's worth getting the M3, but we also think the more affordable ‌M1‌ and ‌M2‌ ‌MacBook Air‌ models are perfectly great for many people.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/m3-macbook-air-review/\">Review: Two Weeks With the M3 MacBook Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-two-weeks-with-the-m3-macbook-air.2422577/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"45ee27793d560220b8a6792aa3e1a6042f70e367cac6b9bef35ce6e84ad57dad","category":"Apple"}
