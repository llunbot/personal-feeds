The company recently issued a <a href=\"https://chamberlaingroup.com/press/a-message-about-our-decision-to-prevent-unauthorized-usage-of-myq\">statement</a> decrying \"unauthorized usage\" of its smart garage door openers. That's \"unauthorized usage\" by <em>the people who bought the garage door opener</em>, by the way. Basically, Chamberlain's customers want to trigger the garage door and see its status through third-party smart home apps, and Chamberlain doesn't want that.</p>\n<p>Here's the statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Chamberlain Group recently made the decision to prevent unauthorized usage of our myQ ecosystem through third-party apps.</p>\n<p>This decision was made so that we can continue to provide the best possible experience for our 10 million+ users, as well as our authorized partners who put their trust in us. We understand that this impacts a small percentage of users, but ultimately this will improve the performance and reliability of myQ, benefiting all of our users.</p>\n<p>We encourage those who were impacted to check out our authorized partners here: <a href=\"https://www.myq.com/works-with-myq\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.myq.com/works-with-myq</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We caught wind of this statement through the Home Assistant blog, a popular open source smart home platform. The myQ integration is being stripped from the project because it doesn't work anymore. Allegedly, Chamberlain has been sabotaging Home Assistant support for a while now, with the integration maintainer, Lash-L, telling the Home Assistant blog, \"We are playing a game of cat and mouse with MyQ and right now it looks like the cat is winning.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982067#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982067&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1c08aa5018aa478e31d806e518c6ef11efaf59b66a7c75feb4035cdbaea2507b","category":"Tech"}
