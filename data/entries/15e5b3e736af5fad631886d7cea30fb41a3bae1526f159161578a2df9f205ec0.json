In 2025, Google Assistant is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/why-wait-google-is-already-dismantling-assistant-as-it-switches-to-gemini/\">being phased out and replaced with Gemini</a>. As Google, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/\">Amazon</a>, and others move toward a world in which all virtual assistants are based on generative AI, it's reasonable to consider if this is actually a good idea. Despite promises of \"smarter\" AI and ever-increasing token limits, these robots still have a fundamental flaw that may make them bad Assistants: They lie.</p>\n<p>They don't set out to lie, of course, because they don't know what a \"lie\" is. These systems attempt to generate the most plausible next token to build an output. Because of this, generative AI is non-deterministic—you can't predict the output, and even running the same prompt multiple times will offer varying responses.</p>\n<p>This can look impressively like thinking sometimes, but it also leads to frequent hallucinations.
