Meta's streaming business that was once viewed as competition for the likes of YouTube and Netflix is effectively dead now; Facebook doesn't produce original series, and Facebook Watch is no longer available as a video-streaming app.</p>\n<p>The streaming business' demise has seemed related to cost cuts at Meta that have also included layoffs. However, recently unsealed court documents in an antitrust suit against Meta [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Klein-v.-Meta-Platforms.pdf\">PDF</a>] claim that Meta has squashed its streaming dreams in order to appease one of its biggest ad customers: Netflix.</p>\n<h2>Facebook allegedly gave Netflix creepy privileges</h2>\n<p>As spotted via <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/facebooks-streaming-watch-killed-sell-netflix-ads-1851367876?utm_source=vip\">Gizmodo</a>, a letter was filed on April 14 in relation to a class-action antitrust suit that was filed by Meta customers, accusing Meta of anti-competitive practices that harm social media competition and consumers. The letter, made public Saturday, asks a court to have Reed Hastings, Netflix's founder and former CEO, respond to a subpoena for documents that plaintiffs claim are relevant to the case. The original complaint filed in December 2020 [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/complaint.pdf\">PDF</a>] doesn’t mention Netflix beyond stating that Facebook “secretly signed Whitelist and Data sharing agreements” with Netflix, along with “dozens” of other third-party app developers. The case is still ongoing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013174#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013174&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56fe8b691ebb6cd50a46fcc60672a040f9cc50802020903b62ef6d83a86e793c","category":"Tech"}
