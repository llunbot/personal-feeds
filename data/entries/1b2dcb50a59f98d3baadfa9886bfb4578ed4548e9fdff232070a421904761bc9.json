The results were strikingly poor, with Siri correctly identifying winners only 34% of the time – just 20 correct answers out of 58 played Super Bowls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPerhaps most notably, Siri repeatedly and incorrectly credited the Philadelphia Eagles with 33 Super Bowl victories, despite the team having won only one championship in their history. The virtual assistant's responses ranged from providing information about wrong Super Bowls to offering completely unrelated football facts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Siri did manage a few streaks of accurate answers, including three consecutive correct responses for Super Bowls V through VII, it also had a remarkable string of 15 consecutive incorrect answers spanning Super Bowls XVII through XXXII.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn one telling instance, when asked about Super Bowl XVI, Siri offered to defer to ChatGPT - which then provided the correct answer. The contrast highlighted the limitations of Siri's own knowledge base compared to more advanced AI systems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe test was conducted on iOS 18.2.1 with Apple Intelligence enabled, and similar results were found on both the upcoming iOS 18.3 beta and macOS 14.7.2, suggesting the issue extends across Apple's platforms. Kafasis generated a spreadsheet of the results in both Excel and PDF formats, which <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2025/01/23/not-so-super-apple/\">you can read here</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeparately, inspired by Kafasis' test, <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber\">tried some of his own sports queries</a> with Siri and compared its responses to ChatGPT, Kagi, DuckDuckGo, and Google, all of which succeeded where Siri failed. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPerhaps worse for Apple, Gruber found that old Siri (i.e. before Apple Intelligence) did a better job at answering a question by declining to answer it, instead providing a list of web links. The first web result provided an accurate, if only partial, answer to the question, whereas new Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, fared much worse. Gruber explains:  \r<br />\n<blockquote>New Siri — powered by Apple Intelligence™ with ChatGPT integration enabled — gets the answer completely but plausibly wrong, which is the worst way to get it wrong. It's also <em>inconsistently</em> wrong — I tried the same question four times, and got a different answer, all of them wrong, each time. It's a complete failure.</blockquote>\"It's just incredible how stupid Siri is about a subject matter of such popularity,\" commented Gruber. \"If you had guessed that Siri could get half the Super Bowls right, you lost, and it wasn't even that close.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, this isn't the first time Siri has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/should-apple-kill-siri/\">received heavy flak for its all-round performance</a>, but Gruber's criticism about \"plausibly wrong\" answers to general knowledge questions ties back to the modern problem of hallucinating AI chatbots that spout misleading or flat-out wrong responses with complete confidence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is developing a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/\">much smarter version of Siri</a> that utilizes advanced large language models, which should allow the personal assistant to better compete with chatbots like ChatGPT. A chatbot version of Siri would likely be able to hold ongoing conversations and provide the sort of help and insight as ChatGPT or Claude, but how well the integration will perform may be a concern, going on Siri's abysmal track record.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce LLM Siri as soon as 2025 at WWDC, but Apple won't launch it until several months after it's unveiled. That means LLM Siri would come in an update to iOS 19, with Apple planning for a spring 2026 launch.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/siri-eagles-33-false-super-bowl-wins-basic-test/\">Siri Gives Eagles 33 False Super Bowl Wins in Basic Knowledge Test</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-gives-eagles-33-false-super-bowl-wins-in-basic-knowledge-test.2448022/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1b2dcb50a59f98d3baadfa9886bfb4578ed4548e9fdff232070a421904761bc9","category":"Apple"}
