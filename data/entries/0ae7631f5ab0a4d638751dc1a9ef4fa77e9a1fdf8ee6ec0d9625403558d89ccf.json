I hope this email finds you well, filled with the spirit of exploration and the love for two wheels. Today, I want to share with you a story that’s close to my heart – the tale of my journey in building my beloved Trek Multitrack 700 Sport.</p>\n<p><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-7.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-7.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-7.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-7.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-7.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>It all began in Bandung, 2020 before a coronavirus spread wide in Indonesia. After much contemplation and research, I set my sights on the Trek Multitrack 700 Sport, I found this bike sale in the Facebook marketplace but before it sold, I already met the guy who rode this bike at Lembang and I remember, I was taken the photo of this bike at that moment. Without thinking twice and also I want to build this bike for my girlfriend, I start to bargain this frameset and buy it. I couldn’t get much information on the internet about this frame but all I could see at that time this bike had a lot of potential. I fell in love at first sight. Chromoly frame, nice original chameleon painted, and wide tire clearance, I just fell in love.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-10.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-10.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-10.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-10.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-10.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-3.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-3.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-3.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-3.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-3.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The project of building this bike was a bit tricky. From selecting each component with meticulous attention to budget-wise, because the bike boom makes all the bicycle part prices hell. I decided to be more patient. After a deep search through all the online platforms and getting more information about this Trek Multitrack 700 Sport. I decided to buy all used parts through an online marketplace, I was thinking just how I would finish building this bike with good, cheap, aesthetic, and functional parts so this bike could fully be operated at that time.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-5.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-5.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-5.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-5.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-5.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-4.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-4.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-4.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-4.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-4.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Because of the little information about this bike, I found this bike had a 135mm rear spacing which not many wheelsets can fit in, if there is a wheelset with the right length, the wheelset cannot use a 10-speed cassette. It’s a dilemma. So I found an adapter for a 130mm wheelset so it can be fit in 135mm rear spacing. Also because the dropout is semi vertical it took me twice to buy a hanger adapter so it can be fit on the frame.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-1.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-1.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-1.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-1.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-1.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>With every turn of the wrench and every adjustment made, the Multitrack 700 Sport began to take shape, this bike is the beauty. You can go wherever you want with it. It might not build in with the branded bike parts but I’m happy to have this bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-8.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-8.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-8.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-8.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-8.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>And finally, I don’t have many words to describe this bike because I only fell in love with this Trek Multitrack 700 Sport. And I’m happy to ride this bike because riding a bike is supposed to be made happy.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-9.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-9.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-9.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-9.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Radavist-9.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>So here I stand, proud to share the story of my Trek Multitrack 700 Sport with fellow cyclists and enthusiasts like you.
