However the old model is just as good, especially at this price: <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-Generation-Lightning/1752657021&amp;subid1=1-1-2148904-1-0-0\">Walmart is selling the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro with a USB-C case for $169</a>, a savings of $80, and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than the port and slightly better dust resistance, the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro are Apple’s best earbuds, with noise cancelation and fantastic audio. The design hasn’t changed since the 1st-gen model but the newer model has longer battery life (6 hours vs 4.5 hours), improved audio quality, Adaptive Transparency mode, and improved 2X noise cancellation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With iOS 17, you’ll also get Adaptive Audio that blends Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation that blends the music you’re listening to with your changing environments to create a more natural experience, as well as faster automatic switching and new mute controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2022-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we praised the AirPods Pro as “the best choice for those who use Apple products” with a $80 discount they really can’t be beat.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ce8af3c56f201678253e44fce8cb4e466822e62702a16f420ae4859bcb382ab7","category":"Apple"}
