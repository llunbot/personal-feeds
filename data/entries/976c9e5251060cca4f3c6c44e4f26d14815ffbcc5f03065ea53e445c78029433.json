Everything is immediately at your disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-device chargers come in various shapes and sizes: flat pads, taller stands, folding travel packages and power banks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1 Pad) is a long flat strip with flexible charging modules for iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses the latest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html\">Qi2 wireless charging technology</a> that is based on Apple’s own MagSafe standards. Qi2, like MagSafe, ensures a perfect charging position by magnetically clamping the iPhone to the charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such it can wirelessly charge an iPhone at the same 15W power as a certified Apple MagSafe charger. Magnetic but non-MagSafe or non-Qi2 chargers are merely “MagSafe-compatible” and are limited to a more pedestrian 7.5W speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\" target=\"_blank\">best iPhone chargers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668468/best-apple-watch-chargers-stands-docks.html\" target=\"_blank\">best Apple Watch chargers</a>, and the Anker MagGo chargers are some of our recommended favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anker is a well-known and trusted maker of premium Apple accessories and is one of the first to launch a range of Qi2 chargers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MagGo 3-in-1 Pad can fast-charge any MagSafe iPhone (iPhone 12, 13, 14 or 15 models, but not SE) at 15W as well as fast-charge an Apple Watch (Series 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra) at 5W and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd generation AirPods, and all AirPods Pro) at 5W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can swap out the AirPods case for a second iPhone (iPhone 8 and later) via 7.5W Qi rather than full MagSafe. The connection isn’t magnetic so you need to be more careful with the phone placement to get the charge right.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station 3-in-1 Pad back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station 3-in-1 Pad back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station 3-in-1 Pad back\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1 Pad) is a horizontal strip measuring 9 inches long, 3.4 inches wide and half an inch high (23-x-8.5-x-1.4cm).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It weighs 12oz (340g) so is light enough to travel with you in your bag but remember that you need to plug the MagGo into a wall or desktop charger so pack a cable and charger with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the MagGo 3-in-1 Pad comes with its own USB-C charger at a decent 40W—enough to charge up a 13-inch MacBook if you wish—but it will also plug into any USB-C charger. We’ve tested the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-iphone-fast-charging.html\" target=\"_blank\">best USB-C chargers</a> in case you prefer a multi-port charger to be at base or with you at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we particularly like about the MagGo 3-in-1 Pad is that its iPhone and Watch charging modules can be adjusted to suit your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rival charging pads, such as the $149.95 <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2323542-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPU82ZM/A/Belkin%20BOOST%E2%86%91CHARGE%E2%84%A2%20PRO%203-in-1%20Wireless%20Charging%20Pad%20with%20MagSafe\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin Boost Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe</a>, look similar but lack the flexibility on the iPhone-charging pad— meaning the iPhone has to be charged flat and you can’t then use StandBy mode or position the phone usefully while it is charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MagGo on the other hand has its iPhone charging pad on a 2-inch (5cm) arm that can raise the iPhone’s height about 4.5 inches (11cm) from the desk and can have its angle adjusted between 90 and 180 degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone can be positioned in either landscape (for Apple’s StandBy mode) or portrait orientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When compared side by side with the Belkin 3-in-1 Charging Pad, it’s the same width but a little less long and deep (Anker: 9-x-3.4-0.5 inches; vs Belkin: 9.3-x-3.4-x-0.8 inches). The Anker is also noticeably lighter (12oz vs 16.8oz) so is more bag friendly. It is also a third of the price of the Belkin charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are available in either black or white colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Charging Pad vs Charging Stand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing between a charging station pad like the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Pad or a charging station stand is all about personal preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pad’s strip of charging points is lower level and more travel friendly than a stand, while a stand has a smaller footprint and displays the charging devices more obviously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MagGo Pad is clever in that it offers the best of both worlds with its adjustable iPhone charging module. It will still take up more horizontal space on your desk or nightstand than most stands, however.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Anker MagGo Qi2 Wireless Charging 3-in-1 Stand\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>Some may prefer a more upright 3-in-1 charging stand, such as Anker’s Qi2 MagGo 3-in-1 Stand.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Anker MagGo Qi2 Wireless Charging 3-in-1 Stand\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Some may prefer a more upright 3-in-1 charging stand, such as Anker’s Qi2 MagGo 3-in-1 Stand.</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Anker MagGo Qi2 Wireless Charging 3-in-1 Stand\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wireless-Charging-Station_Qi2-Stand.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Some may prefer a more upright 3-in-1 charging stand, such as Anker’s Qi2 MagGo 3-in-1 Stand.</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Anker does have a stand version: the rather predictably named <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Charging-%C3%AF%C2%BC%C5%92Cable-Bundle-White/dp/B0CFXQMZJT?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1 Stand)</a> shown above.

Similarly priced ($109.99/£99.99), this super compact 3-in-1 charger is about the size of a credit card (3.5×2.36 inches; 8.9×6cm) but an inch (2.5cm) deep, and is lightweight at 6.9oz (195g). You can raise the foldable Qi2 pad to create a mini stand for your iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also charge an iPhone with that charger folded and the Qi2 pad on top. You need to unfold it only if you want to charge some AirPods or use the Qi2 pad as a stand. The 5W Watch-charging module is tucked away on the underside and can lie flat or sit up at an angle for Nightstand mode. Above the base is the Qi wireless charging pad that will 5W charge your AirPods when inside a wireless charging case.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station 3-in-1 Pad back charging\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station 3-in-1 Pad back charging\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station 3-in-1 Pad back charging\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anker-MagGo-Wirless-Charging-Station-3-in-1-pad_device-back.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price &amp;

You can view and use your iPhone while it is charging, which is usually only possible with a stand. For that and its reasonable price, it’s our number one low-level 3-in-1 Apple-device charging strip.</p>\n\nMobile Phone Accessories, Mobile Phone Chargers, Power</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"976c9e5251060cca4f3c6c44e4f26d14815ffbcc5f03065ea53e445c78029433","category":"Apple"}
