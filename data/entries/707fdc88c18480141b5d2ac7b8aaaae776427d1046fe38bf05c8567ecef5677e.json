By nonsense, we mean printers<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-ceo-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-fights-viruses/\"> suddenly bricking features</a>, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/\">scanning</a> or printing, if users install third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party toner and ink, despite customer blowback and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-sued-again-for-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-accused-of-monopoly/\">lawsuits</a>. Brother’s laser printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars that this isn’t true.</p>\n<p>On March 3, YouTuber Louis Rossman posted a video saying that “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpHX_9fHNqE\">Brother turns heel &amp; becomes anti-consumer printer company</a>.” The video, spotted by <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/printers/brother-accused-of-locking-down-third-party-printer-ink-cartridges-via-firmware-updates-removing-older-firmware-versions-from-support-portals\">Tom’s Hardware</a>, has 163,000 views as of this writing and seems to be based on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/s9b2eg/brother_mfc_firmware_update_nongenuine_toner_now/\">a Reddit post </a>from 2022. In that post, Reddit user 20Factorial said that firmware update W1.56 caused the automatic color registration feature to stop working on his Brother MFC-3750 when using third-party cartridges.</p>\n<p>“With the colors not able to be aligned, the printer is effectively non-functional,” 20Factorial said. The Redditor went on to say that when asked, a Brother customer service agent confirmed that “the printer is non-functional without genuine toner.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/brother-denies-using-firmware-updates-to-brick-printers-with-third-party-ink/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/brother-denies-using-firmware-updates-to-brick-printers-with-third-party-ink/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"707fdc88c18480141b5d2ac7b8aaaae776427d1046fe38bf05c8567ecef5677e","category":"Tech"}
