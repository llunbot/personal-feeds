On Friday, February 21 the Apple Store will open for pre-orders, so that those who want a handset can race to place their order and then wait a week or so to receive the new handset which officially goes on sale on February 28.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you are unlikely to be the only person pre-ordering a new iPhone. In our experience, a hesitation of only a few minutes can postpone the delivery of a device by days, if not weeks. In this article, we’ll help you get ready so that you can place your order quickly and be one of the first to get the new iPhone from Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want to be in with the best chance of getting a new iPhone 16e model read on to find out what you should do – now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you don’t have to pre-order and you don’t have to buy from Apple. Alongside the Apple Stores other resellers will be selling the iPhone from February 28. Alternative resellers in the U.S. will include Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Boost Infinite, Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. In the U.K. as well as the phone networks you can buy a new iPhone off contract from Amazon, Currys, Argos, AO, KRCS and others in the U.K.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672801/best-iphone-deals.html\">best iPhone deals round up</a> to get the best prices.

You don’t want to find that you need to enter a new credit card or alternative delivery address when you are attempting to order your iPhone. Don’t delay because Apple is very likely to take the Apple Store offline before the product launches – so you won’t be able to make any amendments to your account. Don’t wait until the day pre-orders start to check your account because inevitably on entering the Apple website you will be greeted with an Apple logo and the words: “We’ll be right back”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to check your Apple account</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The summary of your Apple account activities can be found at <a href=\"https://secure2.store.apple.com/shop/account/home\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in with your password or touch or Face ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check whether the delivery address is still correct.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check whether a current credit card is listed as the payment method.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Find the iPhone you want and get ready to pre-order</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone-16e-ready-to-buy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"get iPhone 16e\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Screenshot</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Following the keynote the new iPhones quickly appeared in Apple’s web store, but with no Buy or Pre-Order option.
