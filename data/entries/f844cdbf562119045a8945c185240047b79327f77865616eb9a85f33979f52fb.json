There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's May 16, and today's image comes from an on-demand satellite imagery company <a href=\"https://www.heospace.com/\">named HEO</a>. Only this image is not of the Earth, but rather the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>According to the company, which is headquartered in Australia, one of its cameras imaged the space station at a distance of 69.06 km away, over the Indian Ocean. HEO flies its sensors as hosted payloads on satellites in Earth orbit. However, HEO's focus is not on Earth; it's on other spacecraft in low-Earth orbit to assess their status and identify anomalous behavior.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024772#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024772&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f844cdbf562119045a8945c185240047b79327f77865616eb9a85f33979f52fb","category":"Tech"}
