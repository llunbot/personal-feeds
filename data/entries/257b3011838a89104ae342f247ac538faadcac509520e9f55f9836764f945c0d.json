We got a look at five of them at Sea Otter, and they range from road and e-gravel to an affordable alloy trail bike, plus aluminum downhill and dirt jump bikes, too! Here’s what’s coming…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-suncrest-lightweight-climbing-road-bike02.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-suncrest-lightweight-climbing-road-bike02-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari suncrest ultralight road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-suncrest-lightweight-climbing-road-bike02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-suncrest-lightweight-climbing-road-bike02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-suncrest-lightweight-climbing-road-bike02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-suncrest-lightweight-climbing-road-bike02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-suncrest-lightweight-climbing-road-bike02.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ari Suncrest is designed as a climber’s bike, with an <em>average</em> frame weight across all sizes of just 670g! This joins their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fezzari-empire-gets-a-new-fork-to-hide-the-cables-plus-new-frame-colors-rival-etap-option/\">Empire</a> all-rounder and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-fezzari-veyo-sl-aero-road-bike-defies-the-wind/\">Veyo</a> aero road bikes, both of which we’ve reviewed positively and carry forward unchanged for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Details are light (pun intended) for now other than its clear focus on going uphill easily. Tire clearance is claimed at 700×35, and release date is likely mid- to late-summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-04.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-04-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari bonneville e-gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-04.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bonneville is a carbon all-road e-bike that shares design features with the Veyo and their Shafer gravel bike, but with a lightweight Fazua motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-03.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-03-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari bonneville e-gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-03.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tire clearance looks more like it’s for all-road than full gravel, and the front triangle and seatstays have a modified version of the Veyo’s aero shaping.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-02.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-02-1536x569.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari bonneville e-gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-02-1536x569.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-02-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-02-120x44.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-02-768x284.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-bonneville-e-gravel-bike-02-2048x759.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fazua’s drop-bar mode switches are tiny buttons placed behind the hood covers on either side of the handlebar. The display is on the top tube and shows battery life and color-coded mode selection.

That’s likely because it needs to be longer to drive longer shocks and get the full 200mm of rear travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-04.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-04-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari superior peak alloy downhill mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-04.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The oblong shape of the rear pivot suggests a flip chip design. Ari says the bike offers eight different configurations so you can setup the geo and kinematics to suit your needs. It’s shown here with 29er wheels front and rear, but we’re guessing you can run a 27.5″ rear if you want. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-01.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-01-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari superior peak alloy downhill mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-01.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-05.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-05-1536x723.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari superior peak alloy downhill mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-05-1536x723.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-05-297x140.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-05-120x56.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-05-768x362.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-superior-peak-DH-bike-05.jpg 1912w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>3D-printed cable guides on either side of the top tube will likely be replaced with molded parts. Cable management through the chainstay yoke keeps things clean. It’s all external, but you will need to run the brake hose through a hole above the lower pivot point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-DJ-dirt-jump-bike-01.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-DJ-dirt-jump-bike-01-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"prototype ari dirt jump bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-DJ-dirt-jump-bike-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-DJ-dirt-jump-bike-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-DJ-dirt-jump-bike-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-DJ-dirt-jump-bike-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-prototype-ari-DJ-dirt-jump-bike-01.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This DJ prototype should be super affordable, with a simple single-speed setup and rear brake only.
