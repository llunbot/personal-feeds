It’s the operating system on which everything else sits, while also delivering plenty of features and dedicated apps built by Apple itself. Every year Apple adds new features to compatible iPhones, and through the months that follow more features arrive. If you want to know what the latest version of iOS is, or if you’ve ever wondered about when versions came out and what features they brought, we will answer your questions. We also show you how to check which iOS you’re currently using and how to update to the latest iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>February 2025: iOS 18.3.1 arrived on February 10 2025 and provides important security fixes relating to an “extremely sophisticated” security flaw relating to “A physical attack [that] may disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device”. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html\">iPadOS 18</a>.3.1 and iPadOS 17.7.5 were released at the same time addressing the same flaw.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This followed iOS 18.3 on January 27 which brought improvements related to Apple Intelligence (that is now on by default for compatible phones). </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS version history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS made its debut in 2007 alongside the first iPhone. However, when Steve Jobs held the little device aloft revealing it to the world for the first time, it wasn’t running iOS 1. Instead, it was reported by Apple to be <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080115184612/http:/www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html#macosx\">powered by OS X</a>, the software for the Mac. Over time it was called iPhone OS, until finally gaining its now legendary name in the fourth generation of the software when it was shortened to iOS in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significant milestones are scattered across the iOS timeline, with the first being the introduction of the App Store in iPhone OS 2 in 2008. iOS 4 saw the iPad joining the scene and using the operating system alongside the iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 5 was introduced along with the iPhone 4S in 2011, which saw the debut of Siri as a built-in part of the operating system. Sadly, this was the last version of the software to be released when Apple CEO and Founder Steve Jobs was still alive.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Steve-Jobs-with-Original-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Steve Jobs with original iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Steve-Jobs-with-Original-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Steve-Jobs-with-Original-iPhone.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Steve-Jobs-with-Original-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Steve-Jobs-with-Original-iPhone.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Steve Jobs holding the first iPhone at the launch in 2007.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Things changed significantly in iOS 11 in 2017 as it brought the first touch and gesture interface, allowing the first iPhone without a Home button–the iPhone X.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major shift was with iOS 13 in 2019, as it marked the bifurcation of Apple’s mobile operating systems, with iPhones staying on iOS but the newly announced iPadOS powering the new iPads. This would continue through to the present day, although the version numbers have stayed in sync, with the latest ones being iOS 16 and iPadOS 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1794980/ipados-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iPadOS 17</a> are the latest versions of the software and launched in September 2023.

For those with iPhones that only run older versions of iOS, Apple supports iOS 17 and, potentially iOS 16 with security updates (although as of December 2024, it is yet to update iOS 16 since the arrival of iOS 18). When iOS 18 arrived Apple stopped support for iOS 15 – leaving the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhones 7 and 7 Plus vulnerable. Support for iOS 16 and the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus is likely to continue until September 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, many iPhones are able to run supported versions of iOS.

Just go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; About</strong> and look for the <strong>iOS Version</strong> number. It’s the same steps for iPadOS. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"How to check which version of iOS you are using\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1800w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Checking-VERSION.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install the latest version of iOS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Updating your iPhone to the latest version of iOS is simple, so long as your device is compatible. This doesn’t require much detective work though, as your iPhone will know whether it is eligible for the upgrade or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out, go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>, and your iPhone will check to see if there are any available. You may also see a notification on the Settings page that says ‘Software Update Available’, which you can click to go straight to the update page. iPadOS works the same way. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"How to update iOS\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1800w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Versions-Updatae-software.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are no updates, you’ll see a message along the lines of ‘iOS is up to date’. Should there be one available, it should tell you on the screen and give you the option to ‘Download and Install’. Do this and your iPhone will automatically apply the update and bring your software to the latest version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read our tutorial on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670944/how-to-update-ios-on-your-iphone.html\">how to update iOS on iPhone</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there it is.
