Having declared back in January its intention to bring the popular game back to iOS in 2024, Epic Games today boasted that it will also return to iPadOS this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2020, Epic tested the limits of Apple‚Äôs App Store policies by adding a direct payment option to the game. Apple, predictably, responded by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674839/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-stores-epic-games-sues-apple.html\">removing Fortnite</a> from its platforms (Google did the same) and deleting the company‚Äôs developer account. While Epic‚Äôs account has since been <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2257980/epic-games-ios-developer-account-terminated-eu-app-store.html\">reinstated</a>, Fortnite remains unavailable in the App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies have spent the last three and a half years litigating the dispute to determine whether it is lawful for app store owners to forbid direct payment options, among other issues. On a global scale that remains unresolved, but the Digital Markets Act (DMA) appears to decide the matter in Epic‚Äôs favor in the EU. Indeed it goes further and sets the stage for developers to sell iOS apps via their own stores, with more latitude and lower fees as of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218208/ios-17-4-alternative-app-stores-emoji-fixes-security-updates-install.html\">iOS 17.4</a>. (Albeit perhaps <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2217084/report-claims-apple-will-still-control-and-tax-sideloaded-apps.html\">not very much lower</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DMA affects tech companies in numerous ways and Apple itself has acknowledged that it ‚Äúexpects to make <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2133337/app-store-changes-eu-digital-markets-act.html\">further business changes</a>‚Äù as a result of the legislation. And a triumphant Epic <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1750616130174234859&amp;xcust=1-1-2319729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> in January that ‚ÄúLater this year Fortnite will return in Europe on iOS through the @EpicGames Store,‚Äù explicitly thanking the DMA for making this return possible. It‚Äôs not clear when Apple will comply with the ruling, but presumably in the fall with iOS 18 at the latest.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Today, the European Commission said that iPads will also need to comply with the Digital Markets Act üôå<br /><br />We‚Äôre moving full steam ahead to bring Fortnite and the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/EpicGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2319729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">@EpicGames</a> Store to iPhones in the EU soon and iPads this year! üéâ <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/MHh6EGVinC&amp;xcust=1-1-2319729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/MHh6EGVinC</a></p>‚Äî Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1784978618344456484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2319729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of which brings us finally up to date, and to today‚Äôs tweet boasting that the European Commission has ruled that the iPad is subject to the same laws and that Fortnite (and Epic‚Äôs store) will appear on the iPad before the end of 2024. This is bad news for Apple, but it‚Äôs hard to disagree that it‚Äôs good news for iPad owners in the EU, assuming Apple doesn‚Äôt have some counterploy up its sleeve.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c6dfe24461bc8f521b7b50b728888100f149378bc627ee09c4eaf62c685b89f6","category":"Apple"}
