With explicit user permission — that\ncan be revoked at any time — third party apps can both read from\nand write to your Health data. Apple does a lot of that itself,\nboth through Apple Watch and from the various activity-related\nthings an iPhone can track, but third-party apps and devices are\nwelcome participants, in a private, easily-understood way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nobody is suggesting Apple should give up on AI. Quite the opposite. They really need to go from being <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it\">a joke</a> to being good at it, fast. But there’s no reason at all they should build out a strategy that relies on Apple doing it all of it themselves, and Apple users relying solely on Apple’s own AI. Do it like Health — a model that has proven to be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>profitable (for Apple itself, selling devices like Watches);</li>\n<li>popular (with users, who actually use it, understand it, and like it);</li>\n<li>private;</li>\n<li>and open to third-party developers, device makers, and medical service providers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@williamw/114191747428238280\">Thanks to Bill Welense</a> for the suggestion.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/healthkit-as-a-model-for-an-open-semantic-index-from-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1c196e8c620ef747e4f6fcb17d2a2b351e8fcd45c7630025c50fb233ab46340c","category":"Tech"}
