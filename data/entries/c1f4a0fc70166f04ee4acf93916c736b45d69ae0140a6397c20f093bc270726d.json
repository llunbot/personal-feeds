Under <a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf\">the guidelines</a>, even the tiniest Wi-Fi board must either have a randomized password or else generate a password upon initialization (through a smartphone app or other means). This password can't be incremental (\"password1,\" \"password54\"), and it can't be \"related in an obvious way to public information,\" such as MAC addresses or Wi-Fi network names. A device should be sufficiently strong against brute-force access attacks, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing\">credential stuffing</a>, and should have a \"simple mechanism\" for changing the password.</p>\n<p>There's more, and it's just as head-noddingly obvious. Software components, where reasonable, \"should be securely updateable,\" should actually check for updates, and should update either automatically or in a way \"simple for the user to apply.\" Perhaps most importantly, device owners can report security issues and expect to hear back about how that report is being handled.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020491#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020491&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c1f4a0fc70166f04ee4acf93916c736b45d69ae0140a6397c20f093bc270726d","category":"Tech"}
