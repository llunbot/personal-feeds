At a time when it's hard to know what information to trust, I felt delight when I recently learned that World Book <a href=\"https://www.worldbook.com/worldbookencyclopedia2023\">still prints</a> an up-to-date book encyclopedia in 2023. Although the term \"encyclopedia\" is now almost synonymous with <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>, it's refreshing to see such a sizable reference printed on paper. So I bought one, and I'll tell you why.</p>\n\n<p>Based in Chicago, World Book, Inc. first published an encyclopedia in 1917, and it has released a new edition almost every year since 1925. The company, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway\">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, claims that its encyclopedia is \"the only general reference encyclopedia still published today.\" My research seems to back up this claim; it's true even for other languages. Its fiercest competitor of yore, The Encyclopedia Britannica, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-encyclopediabritannica/encyclopedia-britannica-ends-print-goes-digital-idUSBRE82C1FS20120314\">ended its print run</a> in 2012 after 244 years in print.</p>\n<p>In a nod to our present digital age, World Book also offers its encyclopedia as a <a href=\"https://www.worldbook.com/digital.aspx\">subscription service</a> through the web. Yet it's the print version that mystifies and attracts my fascination. Why does it still exist?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938612#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938612&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ffacd2323e61e4b10e453eae8fa106845b242967998a25217b4ee427504c3e0","category":"Tech"}
