Both are rising young talents on the French road racing scene. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teams top fighting force, Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig signed a two-year deal during the height of the pandemic last summer. In fact, the team made sure their core group of riders had job security even when the possibility of racing again in 2020 was uncertain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marta Cavalli, Maëlle Grossetête, and Victorie Guilman were recently handed contract extensions for 2022. Cavalli in particular has been an amazing addition to FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope and performed exceptionally well at the Giro Donne by climbing to fourth place at both of the races mountain top finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>2022 is ready ! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4a5.png\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ko8haIf5Un\">pic.twitter.com/Ko8haIf5Un</a></p>— FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope (@FDJ_NAqui_Fut) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FDJ_NAqui_Fut/status/1428632897959854086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 20, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope is the first of the women’s WorldTeam’s to announce its full lineup for 2022. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/uttrup-ludwig-brown-cavalli-headline-fdj-nouvelle-aquitaine-futuroscopes-2022-roster/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0f961f9ab93c64aac5efd85b528fb511f7b3621c7edbe23e89ddca224e935a4b","category":"Cycling"}
