The report suggests ‌MagSafe‌ accessory manufacturers may need to adapt their products to fit the new system, but this seems very unlikely as any updated ‌MagSafe‌ system will almost certainly be backwards compatible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iphone-16-15-magsafe-comparison.jpg\" width=\"1302\" height=\"1305\" />\r<br />\nPresuming the thinner magnets depicted in these molds are accurate, it's unclear if there are additional changes to ‌MagSafe‌ in the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup that could extend to the charging technology. One rumor has, however, indicated the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/iphone-15-could-feature-stacked-battery-technology/\">could see increased MagSafe charging speeds</a> with support for up to 20 watts compared to the current standard of 15 watts.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/03/iphone-16-slimmer-magsafe/\">iPhone 16 Lineup Could Feature Slimmer MagSafe Components</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-lineup-could-feature-slimmer-magsafe-components.2425387/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f4120393c0c26915f25cf4be60c59c752e85c511c5fb5a06d2a1bac855628224","category":"Apple"}
