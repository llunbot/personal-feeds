Each fiber is much smaller than a strand of hair, measuring in at about six microns thick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGroups of the individual fibers make up threads that are around 150 microns thick, and iFixit says the microtwill material that Apple is using is not too far off from high-end jackets from companies like Patagonia and Arc'teryx.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the FineWoven fabric is scratched, the fibers don't break, but the scratch does cause the affected fibers to reflect light irregularly, which means there's a visual mark. The softness of the material also means that items in the pocket with the case can leave an indentation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-finewoven-cases.jpg\" alt width=\"2839\" height=\"1177\" />\r<br />\nBecause the FineWoven case is made from fabric, it did stain when exposed to hot sauce and oil, though it was able to resist coffee. When exposed to certain foods or liquids, FineWoven case owners can expect to see the case become stained, and iFixit wasn't able to get the oil or the hot sauce stain out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit cut the case open to see how it was assembled. The FineWoven fabric is on the outside, with a gray foam inside. Beyond the gray foam, there's a rigid plastic sheet, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> hardware, white foam, another rigid plastic sheet, and an inner layer of FineWoven fabric. All of the layers are thin, and the FineWoven fabric itself is about 0.17mm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe sides of the case feature the same FineWoven fabric that appears to have been coated in a resin-like material, producing a hard, non-porous surface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit suggests that those with FineWoven cases protect it with a Durable Water Repellent spray to make the case more resistant to staining and liquid.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/\">FineWoven</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/ifixit-finewoven-case-teardown/\">iFixit Gets Closer Look at Apple's Maligned FineWoven iPhone 15 Case With Teardown</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-gets-closer-look-at-apples-maligned-finewoven-iphone-15-case-with-teardown.2403945/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7f05394100e932ec87ac2d760958656653b47c0ba0543877c1f420b461527b90","category":"Apple"}
