However, they said, the FAA needs significantly more people working in its licensing department and should be encouraged to prioritize missions of national importance.</p>\n<p>In recent months, according to SpaceX, its programs have had to compete with one another for reviews at the FAA. This has significantly slowed down the Starship program and put development of a Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis program at risk. Inefficient regulation, the officials said, is decreasing American competitiveness as space programs in China and elsewhere around the world rise.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976438#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976438&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae8059ea5877fb748a9f000bba31f5e82ccd8a901071103c7fd658e972cb80a5","category":"Tech"}
