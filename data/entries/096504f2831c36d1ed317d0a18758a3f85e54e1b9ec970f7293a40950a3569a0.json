If you have movies, music, or apps orphaned on various iTools/.Mac/MobileMe/iTunes accounts that preceded what you're using now, you can start the fairly involved process of moving them over.</p>\n<p>\"You can choose to migrate apps, music, and other content youâ€™ve purchased from Apple on a secondary Apple Account to a primary Apple Account,\" the document reads, suggesting that people might have older accounts tied primarily to just certain movies, music, or other purchases that they can now bring forward to their primary, device-linked account. The <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294\">process</a> takes place on an iPhone or iPad inside the Settings app, in the \"Media &amp; Purchases\" section in your named account section.</p>\n<p>There are a few hitches to note. You can't migrate purchases from or into a child's account that exists inside Family Sharing. You can only migrate purchases to an account once a year. There are some complications if you have music libraries on both accounts and also if you have never used the primary account for purchases or downloads. And migration is not available in the EU, UK, or India.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/apple-now-lets-you-move-purchases-between-your-25-years-of-accounts/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/apple-now-lets-you-move-purchases-between-your-25-years-of-accounts/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"096504f2831c36d1ed317d0a18758a3f85e54e1b9ec970f7293a40950a3569a0","category":"Tech"}
