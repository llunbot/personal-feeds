The ALLYGN M.U.D. fork is a true multi purpose tool made for rough use and it can handle every situation, from serious gravel riding to heavy loaded touring and bikepacking ultra races. As such, the M.U.D. Fork was tested at the laboratories of Zedler and EFBE institutes in Germany, where it withstood the hardest industry standards, successfully proofing it’s strength. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_07.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_07.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_07.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_07.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_05.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_05.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_06.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_06.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The M.U.D. fork has all the mounts you always wished for on a carbon fork, mounts for front racks and anything cages, a light mount, internal brake hose and a super clean integrated fender mounting solution. A very special feature is Fern’s unique design for a clean dynamo cable routing inside the fork leg, up to the headlight and back on the underside of the fork crown to the tail light. You can also run a cable up inside the fork steerer for stem mounted charging devices.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_03.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_03.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/Fern_Bicycles-allygn_MUD_Fork_04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The fork has a plentiful tire clearance; up to 700 x 55 mm or 650 X 64 mm tires, while maintaining the standard 395 mm axle-to-crown measurement, keeping the bike nice and compact without changing the normal front end geometry of most gravel bikes. </p>\n<p>There is 55 mm of rake for additional toe overlap clearance when riding with big tires and fenders. And its slick and elegant design blends in perfectly with the slender looks of today’s modern custom made metal bikes.</p>\n<p>Literally, this fork has it all in one, a true M.ulti U.tility D.esign, just like a Swiss Army Knife!</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://fern-bicycles.myshopify.com/en-us/products/allygn-m-u-d-fork\" target=\"_blank\">Fern Bicycles</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/fern-bicycles-allygn-m-u-d-fork/\">Fern Bicycles ALLYGN M.U.D.
