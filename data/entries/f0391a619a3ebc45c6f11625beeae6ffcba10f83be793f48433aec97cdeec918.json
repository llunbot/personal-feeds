Let’s dive in!</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some of the launches that caught my eye this past week:</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon CodeCatalyst</strong> – First announced at re:Invent in preview form (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-codecatalyst-preview-a-unified-software-development-service/\">Announcing Amazon CodeCatalyst, a Unified Software Development Service</a>), this unified software development and delivery service is now generally available.
