That's true in the commercial vehicle space as well—according to Cox Automotive, 87 percent of vehicle fleet operators expect to add EVs in the next five years, and more than half thought they were likely to buy EVs this year. And where and when to plug those EVs in to charge is a potential headache for fleet operators.</p>\n<p>The good news is that charging infrastructure really is growing. It doesn't always feel that way—the $7.5 billion allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act for charging infrastructure has to be disbursed via state departments of transportation, so the process there has been anything but rapid. But according to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, the total number of public charging plugs <a href=\"https://driveelectric.gov/stations-growth?level_2=true&amp;dc_fast=true&amp;available=true&amp;temporarily_unavailable=true&amp;start_month=2021-01&amp;end_month=2024-11\">has doubled since 2020</a>, to more than 144,000 level 2 plugs and closing in on 49,000 DC fast charger plugs.</p>\n<p>There are ways to throw off a planned timeline when building out a station with multiple chargers. Obviously you need the funds to pay for it all—if these are to come from grants like the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, that had to wait for the states to each develop their own funding plans, then open for submissions, and so on, before even approving a project, for example.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/ev-charging-infrastructure-isnt-just-for-road-trippers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/ev-charging-infrastructure-isnt-just-for-road-trippers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
