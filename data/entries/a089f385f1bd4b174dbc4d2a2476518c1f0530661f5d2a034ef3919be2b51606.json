Today, we’re excited to announce the availability of Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet?utm_source=partner-aws&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sonnet_3-7_launch\">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a> foundation model in Amazon Bedrock. As Anthropic’s most intelligent model to date, Claude 3.7 Sonnet stands out as their first hybrid reasoning model capable of producing quick responses or <em>extended thinking</em>, meaning it can work through difficult problems using careful, step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, today we are adding Claude 3.7 Sonnet to the list of models used by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\">Amazon Q Developer</a>. Amazon Q is built on Bedrock, and with Amazon Q you can use the most appropriate model for a specific task such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, for more advanced coding workflows that enable developers to accelerate building across the entire software development lifecycle.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Key highlights of Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong></span><br /> Here are several notable features and capabilities of Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock.</p> \n<p><strong>The first Claude model with hybrid reasoning –</strong> Claude 3.7 Sonnet takes a different approach to how models think. Instead of using separate models—one for quick answers and another for solving complex problems—Claude 3.7 Sonnet integrates reasoning as a core capability within a single model. This combination is more similar to how the human brains works. After all, we use the same brain whether we’re answering a simple question or solving a difficult puzzle.</p> \n<p>The model has two modes—<em>standard</em> and <em>extended thinking</em> mode—which can be toggled in Amazon Bedrock. In <em>standard</em> mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is an improved version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In <em>extended thinking</em> mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet takes additional time to analyze problems in detail, plan solutions, and consider multiple perspectives before providing a response, allowing it to make further gains in performance. You can control speed and cost by choosing when to use reasoning capabilities. Extended thinking tokens count towards the context window and are billed as output tokens.</p> \n<p><strong>Anthropic’s most powerful model for coding</strong> – Claude 3.7 Sonnet is state-of-the art for coding, excelling in understanding context and creative problem solving, and according to Anthropic, achieves an industry-leading 70.3% for <em>standard </em>mode on <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/#verified\">SWE-bench Verified</a>. Claude 3.7 Sonnet also performs better than Claude 3.5 Sonnet across the majority of benchmarks. These enhanced capabilities make Claude 3.7 Sonnet ideal for powering AI agents and complex workflows.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/02/24/3-7_benchmarks.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/02/24/3-7_benchmarks.png\" alt=\"Claude 3.7 Sonnet benchmarks\" width=\"2800\" height=\"2292\" /></a></p> \n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet\">https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet</a></em></p> \n<p><strong>Over 15x longer output capacity than its predecessor</strong> – Compared to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-5-sonnet-model-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock-the-most-intelligent-claude-model-yet/\">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, this model offers significantly expanded output length. This enhanced capacity is particularly useful when you explicitly request more detail, ask for multiple examples, or request additional context or background information. To achieve long outputs, try asking for a detailed outline (for writing use cases, you can specify outline detail down to the paragraph level and include word count targets). Then, ask for the response to index its paragraphs to the outline and reiterate the word counts. Claude 3.7 Sonnet supports outputs up to 128K tokens long (up to 64K as generally available and up to 128K as a beta).</p> \n<p><strong>Adjustable reasoning budget –</strong> You can control the budget for thinking when you use Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock. This flexibility helps you weigh the trade-offs between speed, cost, and performance. By allocating more tokens to reasoning for complex problems or limiting tokens for faster responses, you can optimize performance for your specific use case.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet in action</strong></span><br /> As for any new model, I have to request access in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock console</a>. In the navigation pane, I choose <strong>Model access</strong> under Bedrock configurations. Then, I choose <strong>Modify model access</strong> to request access for Claude 3.7 Sonnet.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/02/22/0-LM1517.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/02/22/0-LM1517.png\" alt=\"Model access in Amazon Bedrock\" width=\"1580\" height=\"673\" /></a></p> \n<p>To try Claude 3.7 Sonnet, I choose <strong>Chat / Text</strong> under <strong>Playgrounds</strong> in the navigation pane.
