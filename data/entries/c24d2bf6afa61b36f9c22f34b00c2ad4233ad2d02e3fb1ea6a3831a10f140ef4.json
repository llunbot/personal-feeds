In intraday trading today, Apple overtook Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company again, but the two tech giants may trade places throughout the day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Mint.jpg\" width=\"2676\" height=\"1504\" />\r<br />\nApple's stock crossed the $200 mark and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/aapl-all-time-high-wwdc-2024/\">set a new all-time high</a> on Tuesday, and it has rose another 3% today as of writing. Generative AI has been a buzz topic for investors since ChatGPT debuted in 2022, and Apple finally unveiling its own strategy for the technology has likely contributed to this surge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence features will allow users to summarize text, create custom emoji and images, receive priority notifications, and more. Siri is also getting smarter with Apple Intelligence, with richer language understanding and more per-app controls. The features will require an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, or a Mac or iPad with an M1 chip or newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple had a market cap of $3.28 trillion as of writing, compared to $3.25 trillion for Microsoft.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/apple-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-again/\">Apple Passes Microsoft to Become World's Most Valuable Company Again</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-passes-microsoft-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company-again.2428993/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c24d2bf6afa61b36f9c22f34b00c2ad4233ad2d02e3fb1ea6a3831a10f140ef4","category":"Apple"}
