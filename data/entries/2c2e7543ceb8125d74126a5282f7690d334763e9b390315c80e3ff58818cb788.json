The blog post notes that \"most people who want additional information tend to browse up to four pages of search results.\" If you search on your phone, you'll find that continuous scrolling lasts for exactly four pages before the familiar \"show more\" link pops up. When Google automatically loads the next page, it also sticks an ad before the next page of search results.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804467#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804467&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2c2e7543ceb8125d74126a5282f7690d334763e9b390315c80e3ff58818cb788","category":"Tech"}
