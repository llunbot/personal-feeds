This year, Apple is introducing new A18-series chips for both Pro and non-Pro iPhones, chips which it says are \"designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up.\"</p>\n<p>The Apple A18 (no Pro, no Bionic, just A18) will power the new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/iphone-16-gets-two-new-buttons-and-a-new-camera-look/\">iPhone 16 and 16 Plus</a>—the iPhone 15 used an A16 Bionic, and jumping two chip generations in one year makes for more impressive-sounding performance numbers.</p>\n<p>Like the last few generations of iPhone chip, the A18 includes a 6-core CPU, with two high-performance processor cores and four high-efficiency cores. Apple says the CPU is 30 percent faster than the A16 chip in the iPhone 15. The A18 also includes a 5-core GPU that Apple says is 40 percent faster than the GPU in the iPhone 15—the A18 GPU also supports hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, first introduced in the A17 Pro.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048465#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048465&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d8a44e4e4888b27c785a552681ad5a1958affcc55358628bdf4d13ec879943db","category":"Tech"}
