{"title":"New – Amazon EC2 M7a General Purpose Instances Powered by 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-m7a-general-purpose-instances-powered-by-4th-gen-amd-epyc-processors/","date":1692137115000,"content":"<p>In November 2021, we launched <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-m6a-instances-powered-by-3rd-gen-amd-epyc-processors/\">Amazon EC2 M6a instances</a>, powered by 3rd Gen AMD EPYC (Milan) processors, running at frequencies up to 3.6 GHz, which offer you up to 35 percent improvement in price performance compared to M5a instances. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/#Customer_Success_Stories\">Many customers</a> who run workloads that are dependent on x86 instructions, such as SAP, are looking for ways to optimize their cloud utilization. They’re taking advantage of the compute choice that EC2 offers.</p> \n<p>Today, we’re announcing the general availability of new, general purpose <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m7a/\"><strong>Amazon EC2 M7a instances</strong></a><strong>,</strong> powered by the 4th Gen AMD EPYC (Genoa) processors with a maximum frequency of 3.7 GHz, which offer up to 50 percent higher performance compared to M6a instances. This increased performance gives you the ability to process data faster, consolidate workloads, and lower the cost of ownership.</p> \n<p>M7a instances support <a href=\"https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/avx512_vnni\">AVX-512, Vector Neural Network Instructions</a> (VNNI) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format\">brain floating point</a> (bfloat16). These instances feature Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) memory, which enable high-speed access to memory bandwidth compared to DDR4 memory to enable high-speed access to data in memory and 2.25 times more memory bandwidth compared to M6a instances for lower latency.</p> \n<p>M7a instances are SAP-certified and ideal for applications that benefit from high performance and high throughput, such as financial applications, application servers, simulation modeling, gaming, mid-size data stores, application development environments, and caching fleets.</p> \n<p>M7a instances feature sizes of up to 192 vCPUs with 768 GiB RAM. Here are the detailed specs:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (GiB)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network Bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS Bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.medium</strong></td> \n   <td>1</td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>12.5</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>18.75</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>25</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>37.5</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.32xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>512</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.48xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>768</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m7a.metal-48xl</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>768</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>M7a instances have up to 50 Gbps enhanced networking and 40 Gbps EBS bandwidth, which is similar to M6a instances. But you have a new medium instance size, which enables you to right-size your workloads more accurately, offering 1 vCPUs, 4 GiB, and the largest size offering 192 vCPUs, 768 GiB.</p> \n<p>The new instances are built on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a>, a collection of building blocks that offloads many of the traditional virtualization functions to dedicated hardware for high performance, high availability, and highly secure cloud instances.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Now Available</u></strong><br /> Amazon EC2 M7a instances are now available today in AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland). As usual with Amazon EC2, you only pay for what you use.
