But the now 72-year-old ex-racer was diagnosed with heart dysfunction health issues a few years ago, meaning he couldn’t really ride a bike at all anymore. But with the Officina Battaglin workshop located in Marostica, Italy – and the Dolomites literally rising just outside of town – the whole company set out to develop an ebike to get Giovanni back in the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Battaglin Fenix ebike, stealthy full-custom steel road ebike made-in-Italy, 2x Grand Tour winner Giovanni Battaglin\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_Giovanni-excited-to-be-back-on-the-bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos c.

There’s a built-in 250Wh battery inside the surprisingly slim 56mm outer diameter downtube, which based on my experience would likely get around 50 or 60km of assist range (depending on rider weight, assist mode &amp; elevation). But you can also plus in FSA’s range extender external bottle battery for another 250Wh to double the range for longer rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button.jpg\" alt=\"Battaglin Fenix ebike, stealthy full-custom steel road ebike made-in-Italy, CNC-machined stem with ebike controller\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Battaglin-Fenix-ebike_stealthy-custom-steel-road-ebike-made-in-Italy_CNC-stem-with-control-button-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ebike features fully internal cable routing through the straight 1.5″ headset and Battaglin’s own custom-machined alloy stem that also cleanly houses the single control button for the ebike powertrain front &amp; center.
