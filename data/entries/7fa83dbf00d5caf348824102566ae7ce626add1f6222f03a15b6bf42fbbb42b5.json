We have high hopes for this series.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/11/netflix-releases-first-teaser-for-live-action-avatar-the-last-airbender/\">we reported previously</a>, the original anime series was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. It was set in an Asian-inspired world where certain chosen individuals have the ability to telekinetically manipulate one of four elements (earth, air, water, and fire)â€”a practice known as \"bending.\" Each generation, there is one Avatar who can bend all four elements and is thus responsible for maintaining harmony among the four elemental nations, as well as serving as a link between the physical and spirit worlds.</p>\n<p>A 12-year-old Air Nomad boy named Aang is the current Avatar, but he hid in a state of suspended animation for a century because he was afraid of taking on that huge responsibility. Two Water Tribe siblings, Katara and Sokka, eventually revive Aang, who finds that the Fire Nation has wiped out most of the Air Nomads in his absence. Katara and Sokka join Aang, an airbender, on his quest to master bending each of the remaining three elements. Their mission is hampered by the banished Fire Nation Prince Zuko, who seeks to capture Aang to restore his honor with his father, Fire Lord Ozai, with the help of his uncle Iroh.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998196#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998196&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7fa83dbf00d5caf348824102566ae7ce626add1f6222f03a15b6bf42fbbb42b5","category":"Tech"}
