However third-party retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy run sales all year long. So if you want a new Apple device right now, there are plenty of discounts worth grabbing. In this article, you’ll find the top discounts we’ve seen. Plus, for even more deals, we’ve linked to our dedicated deals round-ups for each product category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple does offer <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">year-round discounts to students</a>, including a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">Back To School event</a> where further-education students can get up to $150 in gift cards when purchasing certain Apple products (this giveaway will be running in the southern hemisphere between January to March). There’s also the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Refurbished Store</a> where you can sometimes grab a bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the table of contents to jump to the best deals right now for the Apple product you want—including the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, iPad mini, and all the M4 Macs, which were announced this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best AirPods deals</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5039w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods</a> were announced by Apple in September 2024. We saw some deals on the AirPods 4 over Black Friday, and, at least in the U.S., those discounts appear to be continuing for now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the launch of new AirPods, the AirPods 2nd-gen and AirPods 3rd-gen were discontinued. You may therefore see deals on those older products until stock runs out, however, we recommend that instead of buying discounted AirPods 3, consider the even cheaper AirPods 4 without ANC, which start at $129/£129. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also introduced a USB-C equipped AirPods Max in new colors and discontinued the older Lightning-equipped models. If you see the Lightning model at a good discount it’s worth buying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C case)</a>: $169 ($80 off, MSRP $249)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods 4:</a> $100 ($29 off, MSRP $129)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods 4 with ANC</a>: $149 ($30 off, MSRP $179)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHYDZSD\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Max (USB-C)</a>: $529 ($20 off, MSRP $549)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZJN7BD\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Max (Lightning)</a>: $449 ($109 off; MSRP $549 – <strong>Clearance</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CHWZ9TZS\">AirPods Pro (2nd gen, USB-C/MagSafe)</a>: £199 (£30 off, RRP £229)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>See our dedicated round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673507/best-airpods-deals.html\">best AirPods deals</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best iPhone and accessory deals</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 Home Screen \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_7.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S. specific iPhone deals are hard to come by apart from carrier offers for new signups and trade-ins. We recommend checking <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/wireless-devices/smartphones/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.att.com/buy/phones/browse/apple/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones/brand/apple\" target=\"_blank\">T-Mobile’s</a> sites if you’re looking to change carriers or add a new line. Apple also offers <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13-pro\" target=\"_blank\">trade-ins and carrier deals</a> through its website. We also recommend that you look at our round-up of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1066992/iphone-14-and-iphone-14-pro-best-carrier-and-store-deals.html\">iPhone 14 deals</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2073364/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-best-deals-carriers-stores-online.html\">iPhone 15 deals for U.S. readers</a>, and with the arrival of the iPhone 16 we will be tracking <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2455678/iphone-16-plus-pro-and-pro-max-where-to-get-the-best-deals-in-the-u-s.html\">Where to get the best </a><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2455678/iphone-16-plus-pro-and-pro-max-where-to-get-the-best-deals-in-the-u-s.html\">iPhone 16, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max</a> deals in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K., we frequently see Apple-certified resellers discount unlocked iPhones.
