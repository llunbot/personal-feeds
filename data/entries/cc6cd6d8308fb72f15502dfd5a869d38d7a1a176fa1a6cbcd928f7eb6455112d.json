Those lines aim to solve an issue near to the hearts of fans of <em>Fallout 1, 2, </em>and <em>New Vegas: </em>role-playing. If you're playing as a ruthless jerk, a brilliant nuclear scientist, or a strong but dimwitted dolt, you'll see more dialogue options that reflect this. Mechanically, the roll-the-dice speech \"checks,\" which are based solely on your charisma level in the default game, can now be unlocked using related traits or skills.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cannibal.jpeg\"><img alt=\"If you're going to let a player be a cannibal, let them talk about it, too.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cannibal-640x360.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cannibal.jpeg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cannibal.jpeg\">If you're going to let a player be a cannibal, let them talk about it, too.</a> (credit: Bethesda / ProjMajowski)</p></div>\n<p>They're not just new labels on existing dialogue, either. RED, created by <a href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/69389\">NexusMods user ProfMajowski</a> (and first seen by us <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/dialogue-mod-bethesda-rpg-game\">at PCGamesN</a>), says it used <a href=\"https://beta.elevenlabs.io/\">ElevenLabs voice AI</a> to generate its more in-character lines. The results can sometimes \"sound a little 'emotionless,'\" the creator writes, but \"otherwise they basically sound like the real thing.\" Nothing your character can newly say now will change the game's mechanics or reactions, but it should sound a bit more in character.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926831#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926831&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cc6cd6d8308fb72f15502dfd5a869d38d7a1a176fa1a6cbcd928f7eb6455112d","category":"Tech"}
