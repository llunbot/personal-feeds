If you follow lots of channels or individual users across multiple websites, the feature promises to create a site-agnostic feed for updates from those creators that you can access in one place, plus a way to save videos and other files to your <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/organize-your-ideas-with-collections-in-microsoft-edge-60fd7bba-6cfd-00b9-3787-b197231b507e\">Collections</a>. To drive more people to use the feature, it's also designed to show you suggestions about creators you <em>could</em> be following.</p>\n<p>The problem is that this feature may be sending information about every single site you visit in Edge to Microsoft.

Older versions of the browser would only send this information to bingapis.com if you were on a site supported by the content-follower feature, like Pinterest, Instagram, or YouTube.</p>\n\n<p>Developer Rafael Rivera, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697532/microsoft-edge-browser-url-leak-bing-privacy\">speaking to The Verge</a>, said that the feature intended to only notify Bing when you were on specific sites you had elected to follow but that \"it doesn’t appear to be working correctly, instead sending nearly every domain you visit to Bing.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934553#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934553&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b84e6d7acd757ce56edffa9966947262f56b9da3fafe73303ab7fcc6014594db","category":"Tech"}
