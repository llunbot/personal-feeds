features Bosch’s Performance Line SX motor.</p>\n<p>In keeping with market trends, Whyte has also released a new line of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hybrid-bikes/\">hybrid bikes</a> called the RHeO series, with the majority of models being <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Whyte has also launched new branding, which features a modern design language.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the 2024 range, there are updates and spec changes to existing model lines such as the T-140 S and T-160 RS, as well as the E-160 series of full-powered <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Whyte’s trail hardtails have also been updated, with the 529 and 629 both featuring a refresh that gives them new trendier two-tone colourways.</p>\n<h2>2024 Whyte E-Lyte 140 and E-Lyte 150</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

However, this comes at the sacrifice of having only one bottle cage mount.</p>\n<p>Much to the detest of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/oscarhuckle/\">Oscar Huckle</a>, every bike also features 700 x 45C Maxxis Reaver <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/tanwall-tyres-overrated/\">tanwall tyres</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Whyte RHeO 1 ST\" title=\"Whyte RHeO 1 ST\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RHeO ST framesets feature a classic step-through shape.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The series starts with the non-assisted RHeO 1, which features an angular frame design that has GT-esque seatstays, which connect to the top tube and seat tube.</p>\n<p>Featuring Tektro T3020 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">hydraulic disc brakes</a> and a Shimano Deore 10-speed rear derailleur, the RHeO 1 is priced at £999.</p>\n<p>The bike looks suitably modern, with a straight fork, and is finished in a high-gloss fashion grey – or what car manufacturer Porsche may call ‘Crayon’.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Whyte RHeO 2 with front light\" title=\"Whyte RHeO 2 with front light\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Whyte’s RHeO 2 features lights under the handlebar and saddle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The RHeO 2 and RHeO 3 both feature the same <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-cues/\">Shimano Cues</a> 9-speed drivetrain and Tektro T3020 hydraulic disc brakes, except the RHeO 3 is fully equipped with lights, mudguards and a rear rack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whyte RHeO 1:</strong> £999</li>\n<li><strong>Whyte RHeO 2 and RHeO 2 ST:</strong> £1,999</li>\n<li><strong>Whyte RHeO 3 and RHeO 3 ST:</strong> £2,299</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other highlights from Whyte’s 2024 range</h2>\n<p>While the other models in the Whyte line-up aren’t as headline-grabbing as the E-Lyte and RHeO, they have been treated to updates and spec changes.</p>\n<h3>Whyte E-160</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Whyte E-160 S\" title=\"2024 Whyte E-160 S\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The E-160 S uses a PowerTube 750Wh battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The E-160 range is Whyte’s trail and enduro-focused full-power electric mountain bike, built around Bosch’s Performance line CX motor that punches out 85Nm of torque.</p>\n<p>For the coming year, Whyte has given the bikes a two-tone paint scheme that separates the front triangle from the motor and linkage.</p>\n<p>We especially like the E-160 S and its ‘acid lime’ colour that matches the accents on the RockShox Zeb fork and Deluxe Select R rear shock.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whyte E-160 S:</strong> £5,499</li>\n<li><strong>Whyte E-160 RS:</strong> £6,399</li>\n<li><strong>Whyte E-160 RSX:</strong> £6,999</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Whyte 629</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Whyte 629\" title=\"2024 Whyte 629\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 629’s paintjob looks like an inverse of the one found on Cannondale’s Trail SE 4.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Whyte’s 629 is a well-respected trail hardtail with a 120mm RockShox 35 Gold RL and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\">SRAM NX</a> groupset.</p>\n<p>This year’s model remains unchanged in the spec department, but a new colourway of gloss silver and gloss black complements the bike’s angular frame design, replacing the muted tones of the previous version.</p>\n<p>The transition between these colours sees a graffiti-inspired design, which is a nice easter egg.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whyte 629:</strong> £1,650</li>\n</ul>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"20bce095c884deac592d3c24b995158c0c67e3c73f5750d09b30a5c3a8bcde38","category":"Cycling"}
