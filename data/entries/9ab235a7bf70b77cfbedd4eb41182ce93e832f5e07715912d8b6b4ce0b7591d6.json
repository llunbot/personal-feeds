The sites in Louisiana and Texas will be funded by money set aside in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was passed early in President Biden's term in office. They represent a major step for the US, as they're not linked to a specific source of carbon emissions, and the CO<sub>2</sub> they capture won't be used for extracting fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>They also represent a major step globally, as each facility is expected to have 250 times the capacity of the largest currently in operation.</p>\n<p>In the long-term, it's hoped that these facilities will operate as a service to reverse a century of unchecked carbon emissions. The danger, however, is that they'll eventually be used to offset ongoing emissions and provide a rationale for the continued use of fossil fuels.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960812#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960812&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9ab235a7bf70b77cfbedd4eb41182ce93e832f5e07715912d8b6b4ce0b7591d6","category":"Tech"}
