Its biggest downside used to be its licensing requirement—you had to have some sort of Office license or Microsoft 365 subscription. On Monday, Microsoft lifted that requirement, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/outlook-mac-for-all/ba-p/3757787&amp;xcust=1-1-1532898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">making Outlook free for all Mac users</a>. Just <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id985367838&amp;xcust=1-1-1532898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">grab it from the App Store</a> and go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outlook supports many email sources beyond Microsoft’s (which often come at a cost). Along with Microsoft 365 and Outlook.com, as well as Hotmail and MSN, Outlook for Mac also works with Gmail, Yahoo Mail, iCloud, IMAP, and POP accounts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outlook for Mac isn’t merely a port of the Windows version, though many interface elements are shared across platforms, including a Focus Inbox and swipe gestures. Microsoft has optimized Outlook specifically for macOS, with native support for Apple Silicon and Mac-specific features such as Handoff to iPhone, Calendar widgets, and reminders in Notification Center. Microsoft also says it is “creating a peek of upcoming calendar events in the menu bar,” which will be coming soon to the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newly free Outlook is available to download <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id985367838&amp;xcust=1-1-1532898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">in the Mac App Store</a>.</p>\n\nPersonal Software, Professional Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3d5324c3da0cbcb1be63522c253f5bd98e97f3b048fe78d217b58a3f690305d8","category":"Apple"}
