Apple says\nthat, “at a minimum,” users will be able to generate 50 images, 50\npresentations of between 8 to 10 slides each, and to generate\npresenter notes in Keynote for 700 slides. More usage may be\npossible, but this depends on “the complexity of the queries,\nserver availability, and network availability.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/116008952067084300\">Steven Troughton-Smith</a>, last week, after creating an entire app with OpenAI’s Codex:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This entire app used 7% of my weekly Codex usage limit. Compare\nthat to a single (awful) slideshow in Keynote using 47% of my\nmonthly Apple Creator Studio usage limit 👀</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Something feels off here, by at least an order of magnitude (maybe two?), that creating an entire good app costs way less than creating one shitty slide deck in Keynote. It should be the other way around.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/11/apple-creator-studio-usage-restrictions\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e4d9d3d6241a58a8f5cc421ac6390acc05b264e9ec67ada54e6754c15c84795b","category":"Tech"}
