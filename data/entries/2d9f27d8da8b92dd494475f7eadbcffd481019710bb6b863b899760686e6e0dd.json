The latest phone has a new name: \"<a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/pura70-ultra/\">Huawei Pura 70</a>.\" While you wouldn't ever want to deal with the cobbled-together SoC or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/\">whatever is going on</a> with Huawei's software, the \"Ultra\" model does have a cool party trick up its sleeve: a pop-out main camera lens.</p>\n<p>In the years before the smartphone took over all entry-level photography, there used to be a thing called a \"point-and-shoot camera.\" This was a purpose-built device that only took photos, couldn't go on the Internet, and wouldn't let you watch the latest TikTok videos. The trademark feature of these devices was a retractable camera lens, where the front lens (there was only one!) would grow out of the front of the camera when you turned it on. This would give your camera better, longer lens geometry to work with when the camera was on, and would collapse down for easier storage when it was off.</p>\n<p>Huawei's latest phone is replicating that. The giant rear camera lens actually grows out of the phone somewhat, thanks to some complicated gearing inside the phone. It's only the tiniest few millimeters, but it's a start. Smartphone manufacturers often resist adding bigger lenses to their devices because they want to still have pocketable devices. A pop-up lens would give the camera engineers more room to work with while still maintaining pocketability.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018419#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018419&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2d9f27d8da8b92dd494475f7eadbcffd481019710bb6b863b899760686e6e0dd","category":"Tech"}
