{"title":"Apple’s Magic Trackpad is finally getting real competition (or not)","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2569005/apples-magic-trackpad-is-finally-getting-real-competition-or-not.html","date":1736181966000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Magic Trackpad is one of the must-have Mac accessories and has been available for nearly 15 years without any real competition. However, that’s about to change as Hyper is at the Consumer Electronic Show demonstrating its <a href=\"https://www.hypershop.com/products/hyperspace-trackpad-pro\">HyperSpace Trackpad Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyper is showing the device with PCs, as it plans to ship with Windows compatibility at the end of the second quarter of 2025. On Windows, the device will have software that can assign sections of the trackpad for tasks (like gestures) as well as how the “click” feels. According to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334270/hyperspace-trackpad-pro-apple-magic-trackpad-ces-2025\">The Verge</a>, Hyper will provide “basic compatibility with macOS” later this year–we don’t know what “basic compatibility” means, but it sounds like it will stop short of offering Magic Trackpad features like those you find in the <em>More Gestures</em> section of the Trackpad settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld’s sister publication, PCWorld. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568531/hyper-has-built-a-plug-and-play-haptic-trackpad-for-the-masses.html\">spent some time with the HyperSpace Trackpad Pro</a> and called the experience “less than auspicious.” During their demo, the Hyper rep showing the device was “practically leaning on the trackpad to enable clicks and repeatedly clicking to perform basic actions, like moving icons around on a screen.” PCWorld points out that the product is in its beta period, so hopefully Hyper will work out the kinks before it ships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HyperSpace TrackPad Pro measures 6.29 by 3.85 inches (160 by 98 mm) and about half an inch thick. That makes it about as wide as the Magic Trackpad but not as deep; Apple’s device measures 6.3 by 4.52 inches (160 by 115 mm). The HyperSpace TrackPad Pro is priced at $130, which is about $20 cheaper than the Magic Trackpad. So if you want a trackpad that’s a little smaller and less expensive than Apple’s, the HyperSpace TrackPad Pro could be what you’re looking for, if you can deal with its compromises.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>HyperSpace TrackPad Pro</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"HyperSpace TrackPad Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?resize=2048%2C1364&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HyperSpace-Trackpad-Pro.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$129.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.hypershop.com/products/hyperspace-trackpad-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$130 at  Hyper</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"de76aea02226bb1db560bc315eb714b3d9e194ea979e7cc414d485a792c10bb3","category":"Apple"}
