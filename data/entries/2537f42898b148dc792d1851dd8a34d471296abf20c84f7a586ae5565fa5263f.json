Belt Drive Saves the Day","link":"https://bikerumor.com/david-byrne-met-gala-2023/","date":1683126757000,"content":"<p>Well, David Byrne showed up to the Met Gala on a bike, wearing a bright white suit from <a href=\"https://robbreport.com/style/menswear/david-byrne-oscars-suit-1234818678/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Greenfield Clothiers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The significance of this event, which for some reason seems to have <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=david+byrne+met+gala+2023&amp;source=lmns&amp;bih=703&amp;biw=1293&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwighv7Wrtn-AhWNKt4AHXzhDj4Q0pQJKAB6BAgBEAI&amp;bshm=bshwcqp/1\" target=\"_blank\">captured the entire attention of the internet as it relates to topics at large</a>, is lost on me (did he <em>actually</em> ride there? Or did he pull the bike out of a limo for the photo shoot?). Sitting at my keyboard right now, the feeling is somewhere between “letting the days go by, let the water hold me down” and “you may ask yourself, ‘well, how did I get here?’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re thinking the same thing by now, well, I don’t have the answers for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can, however, offer a tidbit of arcane advice: If you’re going to ride a bike in white pants, and you don’t want them to turn the color of gutter funk, you’d do well to rock up a <a href=\"https://www.gatescarbondrive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gates carbon belt drive</a>. Better yet, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gates-carbon-drive-celebrates-decade-flashy-white-belts/\" target=\"_blank\">a white one</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was good enough for David Byrne, and it oughta be good enough for you, too. Might even do the trick if you find yourself biking in a <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/03/david-byrne-explains-how-the-big-suit-he-wore-in-stop-making-sense-was-inspired-by-japanese-kabuki-theatre.html\" target=\"_blank\">giant suit</a>, and you’re worried about pants-leg snags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the bike itself? It looks like David rolled in on a <a href=\"https://abovecategory.com/blogs/journal/bike-of-the-week-budnitz-no-1\" target=\"_blank\">Budnitz Model 1</a>, a titanium commuter bike with a Gates Carbon Belt Drive. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-podcast-ep-035-why-is-budnitz-cycles-shutting-down/\" target=\"_blank\">Budnitz closed their doors in 2020</a>, so the bike itself may be as much of a collector’s item as some of the original Talking Heads albums. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride it far enough and you may find yourself in another part of the world — which is where I wish I was right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuKxofQfraE\" target=\"_blank\">Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away</a>, BikeRumorers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/david-byrne-met-gala-2023/\">Riding a Bike to the Met Gala in White Pants?
