The rectangular beam let you slide the desired attachments onto it, whether it was bike trays or, eventually, a cargo basket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the Cargo basket is official, shipping in October for $399, and there’s a new Uno bike tray that’s lighter and simpler than the Duo version it started with.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks.jpg\"><img width=\"2043\" height=\"1338\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks.jpg\" alt=\"saris uno single bike tray for modular hitch mount bike rack system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks.jpg 2043w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks-297x195.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks-800x524.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks-768x503.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-uno-single-bike-tray-for-hitch-racks-1536x1006.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Saris Uno uses a single (as in, one…as in, <em>uno</em>) sliding hook to capture the front wheel and stabilize the bike. A ratchet strap holds the rear wheel in place, working much like other racks on the market. The tray itself is simple and lightweight, and comes in two versions – a slide-on MHS version, and a bolt-on version that adds an extra bike to the end of the MHS platform. So, with a 3-bike beam, you could have four bikes total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design contrasts with the Duo, which uses two fully closed wheel cradles that open independently to capture each wheel without touching the frame. Those are $349.99 per bike, but the Uno comes in at just $249.99 per bike. The MHS base receivers range from $199.99 to $249.99, and you can mix and match Unos and Duos as you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1201\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray.jpg\" alt=\"saris mhs cargo basket for modular hitch rack system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saris-hitch-mount-cargo-basket-tray-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cargo Basket slides over the MHS base, too, taking up two bikes’ worth of space…so, get the 3-bike base if you want cargo plus a bike. It has 5.5 square feet of platform space and can hold up to 200lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://saris.com\" target=\"_blank\">Saris.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/saris-adds-lightweight-uno-trays-cargo-basket-for-hitch-racks/\">Saris adds Lightweight Uno Trays &amp; Cargo Basket for Hitch Racks</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"159a6b2590d53db8e685c56daddf704ad947355bf3f29804bb3a4c47056b5dff","category":"Cycling"}
