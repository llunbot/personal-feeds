Rolling resistance has also decreased thanks to a new two-ply construction (the old version was three-ply), prompting Continental to claim the new tire is also “20% faster”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, when it comes to tangible benefits to consumers, Continental says the new Grand Prix 5000 S TR is easier to install than the Grand Prix 5000 TL, which was notably tight on many rims. The new tire is also now compatible with the growing range of hookless road rims, such as <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/05/new-zipp-303-s-aero-wheels-are-wider-hookless-tubeless-cheaper-disc-only/\" target=\"_blank\">from Zipp</a>, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/cadex-36-disc-road-wheelset-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Cadex</a>, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/04/enve-foundation-45-65-road-wheels-news/\" target=\"_blank\">Enve</a>, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Continental-Grand-Prix-5000-S-TR-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The lighter weight, improved sidewall durability, and faster rolling are all well and good, but many people will likely be happiest to hear that the new tires are easier to install than the old ones.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting today, Continental is offering the Grand Prix 5000 S TR in four 700c widths — 25, 28, 30, and 32 mm — in both blackwall and “transparent” tanwall colors. Claimed weights are 250, 280, 300, and 320 g, respectively, all with a retail price of €80 (pricing for other regions is to be confirmed).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that one of the last two major holdouts on hookless road tire compatibility has made the switch, will Vittoria be far behind? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, more information can be found at <a href=\"https://www.continental-tires.com/bicycle/tires/race-tires/grand-prix-5000-s-tr\" target=\"_blank\">www.continental-tires.com</a>.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/continental-grand-prix-5000-s-tr-tubeless-road-clincher-officially-announced/\">Read More</a>","author":"James Huang","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"bc1c8e64054aa157002ae79854ff3cf0754d1449960a51ffc72841f3132089c2","category":"Cycling"}
