Account holders on the Netflix Premium with 4K package can add up to two extra members, but they will still cost $7.99 each.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for account holders on the Basic or Standard with adverts plans, they don't have any option to add out-of-household members at all.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nExtra members will be given their own account and password, but their membership is paid for by the person who invited them to share their Netflix account. Alternatively, they can use a new \"transfer profile\" feature to prompt extra users to make their own accounts that they pay for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix said subscribers living in the same household would still be able to access their account when traveling or on the go, but the streaming company said it had begun sending emails about the \"paid sharing\" plan to out-of-household users on Tuesday, explaining what their options are.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-canada/\">testing</a> the new sharing restrictions in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal since the beginning of the year, and said in April that it was \"pleased with the results.\" In Canada, for example, paid sharing resulted in a larger Netflix membership base and an acceleration in revenue growth, which has given Netflix the confidence to expand it to the United States and elsewhere.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix claimed last year that more than 100 million households are sharing accounts, which is impacting its ability to \"invest in and improve Netflix\" for paying members.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/netflix-starts-password-sharing-crackdown/\">Netflix Begins Crackdown on Password Sharing in US and UK</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-begins-crackdown-on-password-sharing-in-us-and-uk.2390395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d7508ec933de010ae4a306ea73865386655f97f6dfbc89140f3d3f167e597839","category":"Apple"}
