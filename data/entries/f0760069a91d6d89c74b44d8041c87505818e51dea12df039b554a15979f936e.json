On X (formerly Twitter), Vestager explained that she stressed Apple's impending obligation to allow users to install third-party app stores and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/\">sideload apps</a> under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). They also spoke about ongoing investigations involving Apple, such as a complaint raised by Spotify against <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, but Vestager declined to provide more specific detail of the discussion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is facing a range of challenges in the EU, such as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-could-pay-ireland-eu-tax-dispute/\">$14 billion tax dispute</a> and a potential deal to open up the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s NFC technology to payment services from rival companies. Most strikingly, new EU rules such as the DMA designate major tech companies as \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/\">gatekeepers</a>\" and compel them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. The DMA is expected to force Apple to make significant changes to the way the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> work in Europe. For example, Apple will be obliged to give developers the ability to promote their offers outside the ‌‌‌‌App Store‌‌‌‌ and use third-party payment systems.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/12/tim-cook-meets-eu-antitrust-chief/\">Tim Cook Meets EU Antitrust Chief Ahead of iPhone App Sideloading Deadline</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-meets-eu-antitrust-chief-ahead-of-iphone-app-sideloading-deadline.2416141/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0760069a91d6d89c74b44d8041c87505818e51dea12df039b554a15979f936e","category":"Apple"}
