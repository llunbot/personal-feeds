Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Waynesville. Hardwick told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he believed people \"<a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-house-advances-measure-limiting-vaccines/article_152ad2f3-54c7-5c1a-9870-7759d545715e.htm\">lost their minds</a>\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that legally barring officials and employers from requiring life-saving vaccination, even among health care workers, feels \"like it's the right thing to do.\"</p>\n<p>The bill specifically bars requirements for people to receive COVID-19 vaccines. But it doesn't stop there. It also bars any requirements for people to receive \"a dose of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA),\" thus barring requirements for any future mRNA-based vaccines, should they be needed in upcoming pandemics or outbreaks. It also bars requirements for \"any treatment or procedure intended or designed to edit or alter human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or the human genome,\" and \"any mechanical or electronic device\" that would be placed \"under the skin.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926437#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926437&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc803864ae5e0086153bf40ad076ce1098e9d98c7f800a389224dbf2db4fa239","category":"Tech"}
