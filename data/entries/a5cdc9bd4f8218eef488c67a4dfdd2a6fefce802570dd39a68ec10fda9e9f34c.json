{"title":"Ineos Grenadiers launch 2022 kit","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/ineos-grenadiers-launch-2022-kit","date":1638529228000,"content":"\n      <p><span>After announcing earlier this year that <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/desire-journal/outfitting-team-ineos\">Bioracer would take over as kit sponsors for 2022</a>, Ineos Grenadiers have today released the fresh design courtesy of the Belgian clothing manufacturer. While it is a striking new look, the colourway has remained similar to that seen in previous years, retaining the team's bold visual identity in the peloton.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tom-Rouleur-Edits-12_1024x1024.jpg?v=1638528343\" />\n<p>The kit is almost a fusion of the jerseys worn by Team Ineos in previous seasons. The red colour that adorns the sleeves harks back to the 2019 kit seen when Ineos first took over as sponsors from Sky, while the blue base colour remains in line with the kit worn in 2021. Most notably the red Grenadiers logo that donned the front of the jersey this year has gone, replaced by the Ineos logo front and centre as seen in the original Ineos kit.</p>\n<p><span>Bioracer has certainly added a bit more flair to the jersey, moving away from the plain dark blue seen on the backs of the likes of Egan Bernal and Filippo Ganna in the Grand Tours this year. </span><span>The rear of the jersey uses a textured effect over the team's iconic line, alongside bolder flag blue and brigade red colouring. Subtle Ineos logos in a pattern on the shoulders and a diamond shaped fade on the sleeves add much more interest. Bioracer has used a velocity pattern here on the arm, composed of </span><span>Grenadier \"lambda\". </span></p>\n<p><span>Still, the design remains simple and classy with Bioracer resisting the urge to overcomplicate what we think has been one of the most visually pleasing kits in the peloton in recent years.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\">Subscribe now to receive Issue 108, and our exclusive interview with Tom Pidcock</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tom-Rouleur-Edits-14_1024x1024.jpg?v=1638528394\" />With its own biomechanics labs, a CDF computer modelling suite, and a private wind tunnel, it’s clear that the technical performance of Bioracer’s kit will be as important as aesthetics. The Belgian firm has long had a scientific approach to kit design, one that should fit well with the Ineos Grenadier’s meticulous, ‘marginal gains’ approach to racing. While Bioracer may not be as world-renowned as previous kit sponsor Castelli, the brand has a unique business model compared to many of its competitors.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bioracer’s focus is largely on creating bespoke kits for those who are looking for every possible millisecond when it comes to aerodynamics, rather than selling directly to the mass market. They outfit the Belgian, Dutch and German national teams, meaning that Bioracer kit has helped the likes of Anna van der Breggen, Wout van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel to victory in recent years. Chosen by the best riders in the world, this leaves little doubt about the quality and performance of the Bioracer kit.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tom-pidcock-didn-t-run-a-13-25-5km-but-is-headed-to-oregon-to-see-how-fast-he-can-go\">Related – Tom Pidcock on his infamous 13.25 5km run</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tom-Rouleur-Edits-9_1024x1024.jpg?v=1638528436\" /><span>The Ineos Grenadiers will hope that this new look leads to a new lease of life for the team in 2022. Though they had a respectable 2021 season, with wins in the Giro d'Italia, </span><span><span>Critérium du Dauphiné</span>, Tour de Romandie and </span><span>Dwars door Vlaanderen</span>, the team’s performance in the Tour de France made it clear there is more work to be done.

Bioracer will certainly hope to see its jersey on the podium at the Champs Elysees. </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>These images are from an exclusive interview with Tom Pidcock that will appear in the next issue of Rouleur. <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\">Subscribe</a> now to receive your copy.</em></strong></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"a5cdc9bd4f8218eef488c67a4dfdd2a6fefce802570dd39a68ec10fda9e9f34c","category":"Cycling"}
