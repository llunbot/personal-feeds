Google Maps will show directions, live ETA, and even update the route if the user takes a different path, as shown in the GIF embedded below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGlanceable directions are off by default, but can be enabled in the app's main settings, under Navigation. In our tests on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, the setting only appeared after switching Google accounts, suggesting the feature is still rolling out. However, we are still not seeing support for Live Activities in iOS, which was promised a year ago.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/glanceable-directions-google-maps.jpg\" alt=\"google maps\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nGoogle first announced glanceable directions last <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/\">February</a>, and in June said the feature was rolling out that month for walking, cycling, and driving directions on Android and iOS, including compatibility with Live Activities in iOS 16.1. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/glanceable_google_maps.gif\" width=\"888\" height=\"482\" />\r<br />\nBased on assets recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/google-maps-live-activities-support-continues/\">unearthed</a> by <em>MacRumors</em> in an earlier version of the app, Google Maps continues to work on integrating Live Activities support for iPhones, but when we'll actually see it at this point is anyone's guess.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/\">Google Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/google-maps-rolls-out-glanceable-directions/\">Google Maps Finally Rolls Out Glanceable Directions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-finally-rolls-out-glanceable-directions.2420618/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"455096bdf1f5bee58476cac2498acfe71755920b650b1ce23353241b2babb2f4","category":"Apple"}
