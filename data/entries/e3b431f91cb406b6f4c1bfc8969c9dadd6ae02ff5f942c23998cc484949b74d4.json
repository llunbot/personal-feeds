In his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, he said production is well underway for the new iPad Pro models and a new 13-inch MacBook Air at a minimum within Apple's supply chain in Asia.\r<br />\n \r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2192\" height=\"1233\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we reiterate Gurman's expectations for the new iPads and Macs, along with other rumored features and changes for the devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPad Air</h2>\r<br />\nThe iPad Air lineup is expected to gain a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/\">12.9-inch display size</a> alongside an updated 10.9-inch model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumored and/or likely features for the next iPad Air models include Apple's M2 chip for faster performance, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/\">redesigned rear camera bump</a>, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3. No major external design changes are expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current fifth-generation iPad Air with the M1 chip was released in March 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPad Pro</h2>\r<br />\nThe next 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/\">with OLED displays</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOLED technology would enable the next iPad Pro displays to offer increased brightness, more vivid colors, higher contrast ratio, lower power consumption, and other benefits compared to existing models with LCD panels. Apple already uses OLED displays for the latest iPhone and Apple Watch models, excluding the lower-end iPhone SE.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nDue to the switch to OLED, the next iPad Pro models are expected to be more expensive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPad Pro models released in 2017 and later support ProMotion, allowing for a variable refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. OLED and LTPO display technology would likely allow for the refresh rate to drop down further to 10Hz or lower to save battery life. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models can reach as low as 1Hz while in always-on display mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther rumored and/or likely features for the next iPad Pro models include Apple's latest M3 chip for faster performance, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/\">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/\">redesigned Magic Keyboard</a> with a larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/\">landscape-oriented front camera</a>. There may also be rear camera design changes, like on the next iPad Air models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current iPad Pro models with the M2 chip were released in October 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>MacBook Air</h2>\r<br />\nWhile the current 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air launched a year apart due to production delays, the models should be updated simultaneously this March. The key new feature for the laptops will be Apple's latest M3 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/macbook-air-spacegray-purple.jpg\" width=\"1428\" height=\"802\" />\r<br />\nWith the M3 chip, the next MacBook Air models will gain hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for improved graphics rendering in games, including more accurate lighting, reflections, and shadows. Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptop will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last updated the 13-inch MacBook Air in July 2022, while the first-ever 15-inch MacBook Air was released in June 2023.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/\">Gurman: New iPads and Macs Likely to Launch in Late March</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-likely-to-launch-in-late-march.2417671/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e3b431f91cb406b6f4c1bfc8969c9dadd6ae02ff5f942c23998cc484949b74d4","category":"Apple"}
