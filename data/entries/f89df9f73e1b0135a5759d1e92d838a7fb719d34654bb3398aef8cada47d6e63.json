Its most signification new features are a 5x optical telephoto lens, USB-C with speeds up to 10 Gps, and lighter weight thanks to a smaller, titanium body. It will start at $1,199/£1,199 for 256GB when it goes on sale starting September 15, with availability on September 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the same as the iPhone 15 Pro. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-max-specs-release-price.html\">You can read all the details about the iPhone 15 line in our guide</a>. Here, we will cover the differences that make the Pro Max model unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Updated September 12:</strong> <em>Apple has officially announced the iPhone 15 Pro Max. We have updated this guide with the official information.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Max: Price and release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Preorders for the iPhone 15 Pro Max begin on September 15, with availability in stores from September 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices start at $1,199/£1,199, a $100 increase in price compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. But that includes 256GB of storage, while the base model of the iPhone 14 Pro Max was 128GB (the 256GB version was $1,199/£1,199). In other words, it’s not so much a price increase as it is Apple simply removing the least-expensive option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Max: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of the new iPhone 15 Pro models use a new titanium body bonded to an aluminum internal frame. The display is still 6.7 inches like the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but with a smaller border around it, making the phone body slightly smaller (just a millimeter or two). This makes the iPhone 15 Pro Max the lightest “Max” model yet. It weighs 7.81 ounces, roughly 10 percent less than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes in four colors: Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium, and Natural Titanium. All colors have a brushed texture look.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 5x telephoto camera</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The signature feature of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, besides its obviously larger size, is the new 5x optical telephoto lens. Apple uses a new “tetra prism” periscope lens to give an optical zoom equivalent to 120mm focal length, a big increase over the 3x/77mm telephoto camera on the iPhone 15 Pro.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro Max 120mm\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2940w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?resize=1200%2C673&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?resize=1536%2C862&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?resize=2048%2C1149&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-120mm.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"673\" /><figcaption>The 120mm zoom lens should be great for sports photography and video.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Max: Other specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the increase zoom for the telephoto lens, and the obviously larger size, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has the same features as the iPhone 15 Pro.
