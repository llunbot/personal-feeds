With a maximum length of nearly 30 meters and weighing nearly 200 tons, they are the all-time undisputed heavyweight champions of the animal kingdom.</p>\n<p>Now, digging on a beach in Somerset, UK, a team of British paleontologists found the remains of an ichthyosaur, a marine reptile that could give the whales some competition. “It is quite remarkable to think that gigantic, blue-whale-sized ichthyosaurs were swimming in the oceans around what was the UK during the Triassic Period,” said Dean Lomax, a paleontologist at the University of Manchester who led the study.</p>\n<h2>Giant jawbones</h2>\n<p>Ichthyosaurs were found in the seas through much of the Mesozoic era, appearing as early as 250 million years ago. They had four limbs that looked like paddles, vertical tail fins that extended downward in most species, and generally looked like large, reptilian dolphins with elongated narrow jaws lined with teeth. And some of them were really huge. The largest ichthyosaur skeleton so far was found in British Columbia, Canada, measured 21 meters, and belonged to a particularly massive ichthyosaur called <em>Shonisaurus sikanniensis</em>. But it seems they could get even larger than that.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018235#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018235&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b5d1934655257e738850eff0ee6180bbce49f45ccddbe6c31286a26c165ce74","category":"Tech"}
