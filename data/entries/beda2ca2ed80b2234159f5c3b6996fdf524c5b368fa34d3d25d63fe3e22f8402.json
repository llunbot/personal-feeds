You'd hunt around a dungeon for a key item, use that item to get around some obstacle and/or beat a new boss, then explore the overworld until you found an area that was newly accessible with your shiny new item.</p>\n<p>It's been over six years since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/refreshing-new-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-is-an-instant-classic/\"><em>Breath of the Wild</em> turned that basic design on its head</a>. Traversal abilities like climbing and floating made it much easier to carve your own path through the game's wide open world, to the point where players can <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-speedrunner-conquers-the-game-in-just-25-minutes/\">technically run to the final boss after completing the tutorial area</a>.

In doing so, though, the game seems to have gotten even further from the basic <em>Zelda</em> gameplay loop that served the series so well for so long.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934557#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934557&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"beda2ca2ed80b2234159f5c3b6996fdf524c5b368fa34d3d25d63fe3e22f8402","category":"Tech"}
