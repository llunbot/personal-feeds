But some of the old compatibility gaps remain.</p>\n<p>For example, while many PC games will run well enough on an Arm PC without any changes from the game's developer, online multiplayer games that rely on kernel-level anti-cheat software generally don't work. Drivers and other lower-level Windows software can't be translated by Prism, and in many cases, the Arm PC user base is still small enough that developers haven't put in the work to get Arm versions of their software up and running.</p>\n<p>Epic Games is taking a step in that direction later this year—today, the company <a href=\"https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite\">announced</a> that it's bringing its <a href=\"https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/services-games\">Epic Online Services Easy Anti-Cheat</a> software to Arm PCs, along with official Windows-on-Arm support for <em>Fortnite</em>. Both are coming to Arm PCs \"later this year.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/epic-games-is-addressing-one-of-windows-on-arms-last-big-app-compatibility-gaps/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/epic-games-is-addressing-one-of-windows-on-arms-last-big-app-compatibility-gaps/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2240322bf8c9d30bb01919fc07439aab1caaadd5abf5f32f72d9d25b121b2b88","category":"Tech"}
