The brand has come a long way since launching the Toe Flip, and today it announced a whole new grip lineup ($29 each) with varying thickness, profiles, and in two colors; black and tan. Let’s look at these all-new grips below…<span></span></p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Burr_Grips.png?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Burr_Grips.png?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Burr_Grips.png?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Burr_Grips.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Burr_Grips.png?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/new-grips/products/burr\" target=\"_blank\">WTB Burr Grips</a></h3>\n<p>The Burr features a low-profile texture that provides riders with the most direct connection to their handlebar. Whether you’re hanging on under full compression or yanking upwards to clear a root, the bi-directional texture provides the grip you need to keep everything under control. The thin, 30mm diameter makes the Burr an ideal grip for riders with small-to-average size hands. All models in our new grip line feature a tapered internal sleeve to create a snug fit that eliminates twisting at the end of the grip.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-CZ-Control-Grip.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-CZ-Control-Grip.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-CZ-Control-Grip.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-CZ-Control-Grip.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-CZ-Control-Grip.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/new-grips/products/cz-control\" target=\"_blank\">WTB CZ Control Grips</a></h3>\n<p>The CZ Control features a semi-ergonomic shape that mirrors how a hand naturally interacts with the handlebar. WTB used pressure mapping technology to precisely determine where pressure is distributed on the grips and then increased support in those areas while also conforming to the natural shape of the hand. This results in a shape that prevents numbness and increases overall comfort. The CZ Control features a tapered internal sleeve to eliminate the twisting that often occurs with other ergonomic grips</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Trace_Grip.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Trace_Grip.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Trace_Grip.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Trace_Grip.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB_Trace_Grip.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/new-grips/products/trace\" target=\"_blank\">WTB Trace Grip</a></h3>\n<p>The Trace relies on big, soft blocks on the top surface of the grip to provide riders with maximum comfort on rough, jarring terrain. Ample space between the trapezoidal blocks provides them room to squish and conform to the riders hand. The Trace’s soft compound rebounds slowly to provide additional damping and increase comfort between the rider and their handlebars. These are ideal for riders who want soft grips that absorb trail chatter and reduce hand numbness.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-Wavelength-Grip.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-Wavelength-Grip.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-Wavelength-Grip.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-Wavelength-Grip.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/WTB-Wavelength-Grip.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/new-grips/products/wavelength\" target=\"_blank\">WTB Wavelength Grip</a></h3>\n<p>The Wavelength features multi-directional fins that improve handlebar control while also maximizing comfort on rough terrain. The underside of the grip features a waffle pattern for increased grip where the fingers naturally wrap around the bar. The tapered 30/32mm grip diameter cushions the ulnar nerve and increases both comfort and control in technical terrain. All models in our new grip line feature a tapered internal sleeve to create a snug fit that eliminates twisting at the end of the grip.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Check out some features on the history of WTB below in our archives!</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wtb-unveils-a-whole-new-grip-lineup/\">WTB Unveils a Whole New Grip Lineup</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"1bd5c867e2b2b7669ea79a4aa57ec929f49212ad0954c8af66b2fcb2c8da4749","category":"Cycling"}
