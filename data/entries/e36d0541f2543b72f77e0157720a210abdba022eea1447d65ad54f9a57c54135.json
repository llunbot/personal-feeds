As part of this initiative, the companies plan to expand AirTag-like unwanted tracking alerts to third-party item trackers in future versions of iOS and Android.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/AirTag-and-iPhone-Notification-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1082\" />\r<br />\nTile, Chipolo, Samsung, Eufy, and Pebblebee have expressed support for the draft specification, according to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-google-partner-on-an-industry-specification-to-address-unwanted-tracking/\">Apple's announcement</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe specification has been submitted via the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards organization and will be subject to a comment period over the next three months. Following the comment period, Apple and Google will partner to address feedback, and plan to release a \"production implementation\" of the specification by the end of 2023 that will then be supported in future versions of iOS and Android.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince launching in April 2021, there have been several news stories about the AirTag being used for unwanted tracking. Currently, if iOS detects an unknown AirTag moving with someone over time, they are alerted with a push notification. Users can then take steps to find and disable the AirTag if necessary, as outlined in an <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227\">Apple support document</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/apple-to-expand-unwanted-tracking-alerts/\">Apple to Expand AirTag-Like Unwanted Tracking Alerts to Other Item Trackers in Future iOS Version</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-expand-airtag-like-unwanted-tracking-alerts-to-other-item-trackers-in-future-ios-version.2388424/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e36d0541f2543b72f77e0157720a210abdba022eea1447d65ad54f9a57c54135","category":"Apple"}
