{"title":"Amazon Launches First Kindle With Color Display [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/amazon-kindle-color-display/","date":1729117652000,"content":"Amazon <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry\">today refreshed</a> its popular Kindle e-reader lineup, introducing the first Kindle that has a color display. The $279.99 Kindle Colorsoft has a 7-inch high-contrast display that Amazon says offers \"paper-like color.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/kindle-colorsoft.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1200\" />\r<br />\nWhile Amazon has released tablets with traditional LCD displays that support color, the Colorsoft is E Ink like Amazon's other Kindle tablets, but with new technology that allows for color. Amazon is using LED pixels and a new oxide backplane for color without impacting resolution or increasing latency when turning pages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been rumors that Apple has tested electronic paper display (EPD) technology for future devices, including color EPD, which is similar to what Amazon has just rolled out. Back in 2022, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/17/kuo-apple-testing-eink-display-foldable-devices/\">tested E-Ink's Electronic Paper Display</a> for future foldable tablet applications, and he said that color EPD could perhaps become a mainstream solution for the cover screen of a foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nColor e-ink is still newer technology, but there are other products like the <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-paper/pro\">Remarkable Paper Pro</a> that use it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmazon says that the Kindle Colorsoft is its brightest Kindle yet, and the display is able to adjust the front light for any lighting condition. It continues to have a 300 pixel-per-inch resolution for black and white, with a 150 pixel-per-inch resolution for color.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmazon today also unveiled an updated $399.99 Kindle Scribe that supports note-taking with a white-bordered display and a screen that has a paper-like texture. It comes with a Premium Pen that feels like an actual pen, complete with a soft-tipped eraser for erasing. AI integration allows for summaries and bullet point lists of notes taken, and notes can be refined to have a more readable font.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new additions include the latest Kindle Paperwhite, which Amazon says is its fastest to date with 25 percent faster page turns, and a new matcha color for the entry-level Kindle. The Kindle Colorsoft will ship on October 30, while the Kindle Scribe will ship on December 4. Other Kindles are available now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update:</b> This article was updated to provide exact pricing at Amazon's request. The prior version listed the Kindle Colorsoft's price as $280 instead of $279.99, and the Kindle Scribe's price as $400 instead of $399.99. Note that Amazon's listed pricing is before tax, so customers who live in areas where sales tax is collected will see total prices higher than $279.99 and $399.99. There may also be shipping fees for customers who do not have Amazon Prime.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/\">Amazon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/amazon-kindle-color-display/\">Amazon Launches First Kindle With Color Display [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-launches-first-kindle-with-color-display-updated.2440263/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"87452f93274295e608196710a5c34f392a8af5449b0718b846fb55515d505aca","category":"Apple"}
