Boeing was \"unable to find the records\" and told the NTSB that the security camera footage was overwritten.</p>\n<p>\"To date, we still do not know who performed the work to open, reinstall, and close the door plug on the accident aircraft,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy wrote Wednesday in a <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/news/Documents/Letter%20to%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Commerce,%20Science%20&amp;%20Transportation%20on%20Boeing%20737-9%20MAX%20Door%20Plug%20Blowout.pdf\">letter</a> to leaders of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. \"Boeing has informed us that they are unable to find the records documenting this work. A verbal request was made by our investigators for security camera footage to help obtain this information; however, they were informed the footage was overwritten. The absence of those records will complicate the NTSB's investigation moving forward.\"</p>\n<p>A Boeing spokesperson told Ars today that under the company's standard practice, \"video recordings are maintained on a rolling 30-day basis\" before being overwritten.Â The NTSB's <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NTSB-Boeing-Alaska-Airlines-preliminary-report.pdf\">preliminary report</a> on the investigation said the airplane was delivered to Alaska Airlines on October 31, 2023, after a repair in a Boeing factory. On January 5, the plane was forced to return to Portland International Airport in Oregon when a passenger door plug blew off the aircraft during flight.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010609#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010609&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"99f34afac26f421bb67de16a0ed003208c227b8af6d0ad7e8e5680837b424371","category":"Tech"}
