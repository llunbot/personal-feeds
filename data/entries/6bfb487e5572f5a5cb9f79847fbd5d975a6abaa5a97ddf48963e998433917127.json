Now that preordering is just a week away, Apple has revealed how orders will work, and you’ll need an iPhone or iPad Pro to get one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An update on Friday to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948&amp;xcust=1-1-2200711-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Store app</a> includes Vision Pro ordering “tips.” According to the app, a facial scan with the TrueDepth sensor is required to properly size the Light Seal and headband. That means you need to use an iPhone or iPad Pro with Face ID so Android and iPhone SE users need not apply. It’s not clear whether Apple Store employees will use in-store devices for scanning purposes.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Vision Pro ordering tips\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-preorder-instructions.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the Vision Pro can’t be used while wearing glasses. If you require glasses, you need to upload a “valid, unexpired prescription from a U.S. eye-care professional” so Apple can make optical inserts. Apple is partnering with Zeiss to make prescription inserts for $149 and non-prescription “reader” inserts for $99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you’re wondering how well the prescription inserts work, I used them during <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1944516/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-feaures-design-fit.html\">my Vision Pro demo at WWDC 2023</a>. At that time, Apple had opticians on-site to measure my glasses and pick an insert I could use. My prescription is complicated but the inserts worked well in my demo. The lenses were comfortable and I could see clearly with no visual anomalies. It’s also possible that since the close-up nature of the headset is an atypical environment, an exact match to a prescription isn’t needed for the Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re still missing a lot of details as to what needs to be done to complete the pre-order process. But also, what happens when it comes time for delivery–will Vision Pros be delivered to people’s homes, or will they need to go to an Apple Store to pick it up and go through a proper fitting process? Will prescription lenses ship at the same time as the device? Will you need an iPhone to set it up? We’re sure to learn more next week as the January 19 preorder day approaches. </p>\n\nVirtual Reality, Wearables</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6bfb487e5572f5a5cb9f79847fbd5d975a6abaa5a97ddf48963e998433917127","category":"Apple"}
