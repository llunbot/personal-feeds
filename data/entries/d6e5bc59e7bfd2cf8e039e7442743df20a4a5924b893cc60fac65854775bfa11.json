At the time, Apple said that developers would be informed if they were selected by 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, April 5, following an April 4 submission deadline.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAttendees are selected based on a random lottery system, with Apple Developer Program members, prior-year Swift Student Challenge winners, and Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni eligible to enter. Apple also plans to invite students who win <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/wwdc-2023-swift-student-challenge/\">this year's Student Challenge</a>, but that will involve a separate lottery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>On the day of my 10th year anniversary of moving to the US and attending my first WWDC.

There will be a viewing party for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a> keynote event, as well as a viewing of the Platforms State of the Union. Developers will be able to interface with Apple engineers, visit the Developer Center, attend the Apple Design Awards ceremony, and \"enjoy activities into the evening.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThose who plan to go to the viewing event will need to RSVP by April 10, and invitations are non-transferable. Apple is not providing travel or accommodations, so developers and students will need to fund their own travel costs, but the event itself is free to attend.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/wwdc-2023-viewing-event-invites/\">WWDC Apple Park Viewing Event Invites Going Out to Lucky Developers Who Won Lottery</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wwdc-apple-park-viewing-event-invites-going-out-to-lucky-developers-who-won-lottery.2386015/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d6e5bc59e7bfd2cf8e039e7442743df20a4a5924b893cc60fac65854775bfa11","category":"Apple"}
