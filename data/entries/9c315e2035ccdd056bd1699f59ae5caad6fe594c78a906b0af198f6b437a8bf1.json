The payment followed several court cases in which Apple unsuccessfully argued that it had already acquired the rights for the name as part of a deal with Proview's Taiwanese arm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-trademark-china-huawei.jpg\" alt width=\"1062\" height=\"932\" /><div><em>Huawei \"Vision Pro\" trademark documents (Source: MyDrivers)</em></div>\r<br />\nApple has said it plans to launch the Vision Pro headset in the United States early next year, with the product set to become available in \"more countries\" later in 2023. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/vision-pro-trademark-owned-huawei-china/\">Apple Faces Trademark Battle to Use 'Vision Pro' Name in China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-faces-trademark-battle-to-use-vision-pro-name-in-china.2392775/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c315e2035ccdd056bd1699f59ae5caad6fe594c78a906b0af198f6b437a8bf1","category":"Apple"}
