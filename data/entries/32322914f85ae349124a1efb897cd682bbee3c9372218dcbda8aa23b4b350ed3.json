He was made captain for Brive ahead of the 2010 season and retired through injury. Popham also doesn’t remember most of his career – he was diagnosed with early onset dementia in April 2020. Now he’s on a mission to raise awareness of the dangers of head trauma in sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-970x622.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-970x622.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-300x192.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-768x493.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-1536x985.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-2048x1313.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-750x481.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-by-Tom-Shaw-via-Getty-1140x731.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Popham celebrates as the final whistle blows during the 2008 RBS Six Nations Championship match between England and Wales at Twickenham.</figcaption><figcaption>Tom Shaw via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I know teams I played for and big games that I played in based on jerseys or photos,’ he says. ‘But in terms of actual memories of being on the pitch, being in that stadium, winning, losing, the weather, I have no recollection whatsoever. I would be interviewed about certain games, like being knocked out of the World Cup by Fiji in 2007 and just made it up on what I heard from other people. I met Nelson Mandela before we played South Africa. I got knocked out in that game, had a fit, swallowed my tongue and woke up in hospital. I have no memory of meeting him. I know it happened because I’ve got a photo of it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bike ride in 2019 would be the breaking point. Having navigated his memory loss so far by either playing it down or making up excuses, a blackout moment on a 30-mile cycle caused Popham to ring his wife, Mel. He couldn’t remember the way he’d come or the way home, despite riding the loop hundreds of times before. They phoned the GP and Popham underwent an MRI and DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) which showed five areas of damage. Doctors estimate he had suffered over 100,000 sub-concussions over the course of his career, the majority from training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘After I got diagnosed, we had a week before the follow-up call. We immediately started Googling questions and researching. There was nothing out there support-wise for a 40-year-old. It was all for older people. We knew we had to put something in place. At that time, I was the first to be diagnosed, but I was speaking to a dozen rugby players. We’ve put an information pack together for when a player is diagnosed. They’ve got the <a href=\"https://headforchange.org.uk/thrive-app\" target=\"_blank\">Thrive app</a>, a mental health resource with a 24/7 counsellor or medically trained person that they can talk to. Because unfortunately, there have been suicides within the group. We want to be able to offer all that we can as a small start-up charity, hence the events that we’re doing to raise money for those.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popham founded the charity <a href=\"https://headforchange.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Head for Change</a> with his wife Mel Popham and Dr Sally Tucker. It aims to raise money to educate grassroots rugby clubs and schools on the risks of head trauma. Cycling has always been Popham’s ‘thing’ since retiring. He has participated in Ride Across America three times as part of a relay team and ridden many sportives and charity rides<strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"680\" height=\"916\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-and-Geraint-Thomas.png\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-and-Geraint-Thomas.png 680w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Alix-Popham-and-Geraint-Thomas-223x300.png 223w\" /><figcaption>Sway Communications</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On 19th September, he set off from the London Welsh Rugby Club on his bike. The team of 45 rode 800km over five days in pouring rain, 300km of which was on no sleep, to raise awareness of head trauma in sport and reach their end goal of the Wales v Australia match at the Rugby World Cup in the OL Stadium. Wales would win 40-6. Ineos Grenadiers’ Geraint Thomas rode with the squad for the French leg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When I got diagnosed, Geraint sent me a message asking if there’s any way he could support. We couldn’t do any fundraising activities yet because of Covid. He had just finished the NHS ride on Zwift so I said an intro to that would be great. In March 2021 and 2022, I ended up participating in two of the 24-hour challenges on Zwift that he was involved in. That’s where the friendship started. When I knew I was doing this challenge, I also knew Geraint was a massive rugby fan. I thought, why not ask? We had three groups on the ride to Lyon. He cycled with the faster group on the first day, then the middle and slower groups, riding and chatting with everyone and they all enjoyed their time with him. He’s a great lad.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas adds, ‘It was great to be a part of. I was there with a lot of super nice people and had a good time. A few too many beers but a good laugh. I was glad I was able to make it and it finished off with a cracking Welsh win! Can’t fault it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"794\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-04-at-12.00.02.png\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-04-at-12.00.02.png 794w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-04-at-12.00.02-300x211.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-04-at-12.00.02-768x540.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-04-at-12.00.02-750x527.png 750w\" /><figcaption>Sway Communications</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ride covered 800km with 6,000m of climbing, undertaken by people with different levels of experience on the bike. ‘I’m not built to be a cyclist,’ he says. ‘I’m lighter than when I played rugby but still stood next to Geraint, I look like a giant and then you’ve got Anthony Copsey who’s bigger again, Ian Gough who’s bigger again.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group arrived in Lyon five days after setting off from London. ‘We had a hero’s welcome with two lines of cyclists and the support vehicles in front. There were Welsh supporters in all the bars we passed just clapping us. Before the game, I asked people for one memory that stands out. They all had different ones of course, but everyone said Mel was amazing. She was like a machine, making sandwiches and making coffee, making sure everyone was on time. It wasn’t always easy. We had 35 punctures in one day and one person had seven in one morning!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For me, I got into cycling because it’s not a race. It’s enjoying the people around you. It’s the camaraderie between that group. It’s about getting from A to B, enjoying the craic, making memories and fundraising for Head for Change. Of the 45 people who were involved, I only knew 10. I said this before leaving, but I knew that when we arrived in Lyon, we would all be best friends. And that’s the case. The WhatsApp group is still going like the clappers.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 800km bike ride isn’t the only Head for Change event planned. In a few weeks, Popham will be one of several swimming the channel in a race against ex-rugby union and league players. He also wants to complete an Ironman. Popham was kicked during the swim leg and suffered a concussion in September during the Ironman Wales, which forced him to withdraw. In his own words, he had to ‘practice what I’ve been preaching’ and follow return to sport protocols just a couple weeks prior of their ride to Lyon. Next year, there are plans to cycle to the Olympic Games in Paris to watch the Rugby Sevens too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The conversations we’re having in rugby now were happening in boxing a hundred years ago. The knowledge has been there. For decades. The long-term consequences, the knowledge on sub-concussive hits causing damage over a career was there and never got passed on to us as players. We were told to splash some water in your face, have some sniffing salts and carry on if we were dazed. When a boxer gets knocked out, they can’t fight for eight weeks yet a rugby player can play seven days later. There’s no difference in our brains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I love getting to know people through these events and explaining what Head for Change and our education programme is about. We love the sport and want it to carry on, we just want it to be in a safer position where people know the risks and for the brain to be given the correct rest before they return. It can affect so many things in that person’s life. They don’t have to be a professional either. If you don’t prioritise rest and recovery the consequences could be what’s happened to myself and over 350 rugby players so far. We just want people to be safer playing all sport.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head for Change’s ‘Head to Lyon’ ride has raised over £13,000 so far.
