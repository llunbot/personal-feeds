However, just weeks before this launch was due to occur, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/boeing-stands-down-from-starliner-launch-to-address-recently-found-problems/\">Boeing announced</a> on June 1 that there were two serious issues with Starliner. One of these involved the \"soft links\" in the lines that connect the Starliner capsule to its parachutes, and the second problem came with hundreds of feet of P-213 glass cloth tape inside the spacecraft found to be flammable.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, as a part of its quarterly earnings update, <a href=\"https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2023-07-26-Boeing-Reports-Second-Quarter-Results\">Boeing announced</a> that the Starliner program had taken a loss of $257 million \"primarily due to the impacts of the previously announced launch delay.\" This brings the company's total write-down of losses on the Starliner program to more than $1.1 billion. Partly because of this, Boeing's Defense, Space, &amp; Security division reported a loss of $527 million during the second quarter of this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956589#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956589&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"019986ba0c014a04b9aa9f4ffb244aa27596873fd7f1c1473c1ac9ba4dff20a6","category":"Tech"}
