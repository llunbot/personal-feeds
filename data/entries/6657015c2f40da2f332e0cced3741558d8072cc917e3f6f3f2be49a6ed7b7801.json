Sharing a video to YouTube via the Share Sheet was an option in a prior version of the YouTube app, but it was removed back in 2018. Until this week, there was no option to use native sharing to upload to YouTube. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nYouTube updated its app to version 19.47.7 yesterday, but did not mention the new Share Sheet integration. You'll need the latest version of the app to use the feature. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/youtube-share-sheet-integration/\">You Can Now Upload Videos Directly to YouTube With iOS Share Sheet Integration</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-upload-videos-directly-to-youtube-with-ios-share-sheet-integration.2443997/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6657015c2f40da2f332e0cced3741558d8072cc917e3f6f3f2be49a6ed7b7801","category":"Apple"}
