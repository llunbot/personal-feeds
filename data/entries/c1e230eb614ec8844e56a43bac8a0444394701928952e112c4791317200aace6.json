You can create guest schedules and specific accessories that your guests can use, limiting times that your home is accessible. A home hub is required for this feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can enable Express Mode for unlocking door locks automatically as you approach with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or an Apple Watch, so you don't need to tap your device to the lock to get it to open. You'll need an ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch with an Ultra Wideband chip for this to work, along with an Ultra Wideband lock.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLater this year, Apple plans to add support for robot vacuum cleaners. The Home app will support the core functionality of robot vacuums, like power control, cleaning mode, vacuum, mop, and charge status. The vacuums can also be used in automations and scenes, and respond to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> requests.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is adding electricity usage integration into the Home app, but it's only available to select Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers in the United States to begin. With this feature, users can see their home electricity usage from the Home app, along with rate plan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nElectricity usage integration is coming later in 2024, and Apple also plans to add other providers in the future.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-homekit-features/\">HomeKit in iOS 18 Includes Guest Access, Hands-Free Unlock, Electricity Usage Integration and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homekit-in-ios-18-includes-guest-access-hands-free-unlock-electricity-usage-integration-and-more.2428763/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c1e230eb614ec8844e56a43bac8a0444394701928952e112c4791317200aace6","category":"Apple"}
