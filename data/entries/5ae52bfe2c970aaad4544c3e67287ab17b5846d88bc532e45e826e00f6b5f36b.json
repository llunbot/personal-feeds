The invite might not look like much, but it strongly hints at what products we'll see: the Galaxy Z Fold 3 (the dark grey shape) and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 (the purple and light gray shape). It's clearly a foldables event, but we also might see the Galaxy Watch 4, the launch device for Google and Samsung's revamp of Wear OS.</p>\n<p>Normally, Samsung's August launch event would point to the announcement of the S-Pen-equipped Galaxy Note, but all indications show that the Galaxy Note <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/samsung-will-reportedly-kill-the-note-line-to-focus-on-foldables/\">is dead</a> this year. Samsung shipped an external S-Pen for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, and along with optional support for the Z Fold 3, that will have to be enough for fans of handwriting.</p>\n<h2>The Fold 3</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-renders-10.jpg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          The Fold 3, with a decidedly non-crazy camera block.
