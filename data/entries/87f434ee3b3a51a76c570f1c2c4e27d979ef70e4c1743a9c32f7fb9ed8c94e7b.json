This includes the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, 9th generation iPad, and M1 MacBook Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airpods-pro-bulbs.jpg\" width=\"1607\" height=\"905\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on this version of the AirPods, and right now only Amazon has the sale.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CHWRXH8B\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for $189.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNext, Amazon has the 9th generation iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Fth%3D1\"><strong>$249.00</strong></a>, down from $329.00. During Black Friday, we saw this model go down to around $230 at its lowest point, but today's deal is a solid second-best option and potentially the best deal you'll see before the holiday shopping season ends.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ipad-bulbs.jpg\" width=\"1607\" height=\"905\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Fth%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$80 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for $249.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinally, Amazon has the M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$749.99</strong></a> when you clip an on-page coupon, down from $999.00. Although a few years old at this point, this $249 discount on the 2020 13-inch MacBook Air is a great deal for anyone who needs a simple and reliable entry-level notebook for browsing the Internet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/macbook-air-bulbs.jpg\" width=\"1607\" height=\"905\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$249 OFF</div>M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for $749.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHead to our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to get caught up with all of the latest deals and discounts that we've been tracking over the past week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/black-friday-prices-return-airpods/\">Black Friday Prices Return for AirPods Pro 2 With USB-C, iPad, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/black-friday-prices-return-for-airpods-pro-2-with-usb-c-ipad-and-more.2412873/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"87f434ee3b3a51a76c570f1c2c4e27d979ef70e4c1743a9c32f7fb9ed8c94e7b","category":"Apple"}
