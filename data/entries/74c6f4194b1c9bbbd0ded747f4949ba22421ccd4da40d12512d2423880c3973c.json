{"title":"Apple Sports Is Eddy Cue’s Baby","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/02/apple-sports-a-free-iphone-app-to-get-you-the-score-fast/","date":1708645109000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It turns out that those scores, fed from Apple to the TV app and \nthe Apple TV and a few select other places, are from a data \nsource that Eddy Cue also cares about a lot. He’s been pushing it \nto be as close to real time as is technologically possible, right \ndown to watching his phone and comparing it to the scoreboard at \na Warriors game. And now that data source is driving Apple’s \nlatest app, a free iPhone app called <a href=\"https://apple.co/AppleSports\">Apple Sports</a>, which is \ndebuting today. </p>\n\n<p>“I just want to get the damn score of the game,” Cue says. “And \nit’s really hard to do, because it seems like it’s nobody’s core \n[feature].” In a sports data world increasingly driven by \nfantasy and betting, Apple’s not trying to build an adjunct to \nsome other app business model. [...] </p>\n\n<p>“We said, ‘We’re going to make the best scores app that you could \npossibly make,’” Cue said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love the idea of Cue personally field-testing the app while in development courtside at Warriors games. “I just want to get the damn score of the game” and “We’re going to make the best scores app that you could possibly make” are downright Jobsian in their clarity, and in the fact that they’re driven simply by the notion of making a good, fun, simple, fast app that is highly focused in scope.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the story about Jobs and iDVD? I feel like Apple Sports <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-real-leadership-lessons-of-steve-jobs\">is a lot like that</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Likewise, when Jobs was shown a cluttered set of proposed \nnavigation screens for iDVD, which allowed users to burn video \nonto a disk, he jumped up and drew a simple rectangle on a \nwhiteboard. “Here’s the new application,” he said. “It’s got \none window. You drag your video into the window. Then you click \nthe button that says ‘Burn.’ That’s it. That’s what we’re going \nto make.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/22/cue-snell-sports\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"74c6f4194b1c9bbbd0ded747f4949ba22421ccd4da40d12512d2423880c3973c","category":"Tech"}
