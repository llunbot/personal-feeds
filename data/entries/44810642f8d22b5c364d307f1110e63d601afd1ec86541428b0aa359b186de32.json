Those groups use a slightly narrower MTB Flattop chain, and the rollers between the plates have a bit larger diameter, which requires chainrings with teeth optimized to fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrower gap between chain plates means the teeth have to be a bit narrower to allow proper clearance, allowing the chain to slide on and off the teeth easily and make room for any grit that might be on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>absoluteBLACK went a step further and added a small slit on the wide teeth to facilitate mud (and other contaminant) removal. And they made the wide tooth that sits behind the crank arm narrower than the others to help shed muck more easily in an area they’ve found suffers from higher buildup.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/absoluteblack-oval-chainrings-sram-t-type-transmission-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/absoluteblack-oval-chainrings-sram-t-type-transmission-2-800x660.jpg\" alt=\"closeup tooth profile on absoluteblack oval chainrings for sram transmission t-type flattop MTB chains\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/absoluteblack-oval-chainrings-sram-t-type-transmission-2-800x660.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/absoluteblack-oval-chainrings-sram-t-type-transmission-2-297x245.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/absoluteblack-oval-chainrings-sram-t-type-transmission-2-120x99.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/absoluteblack-oval-chainrings-sram-t-type-transmission-2-768x634.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/absoluteblack-oval-chainrings-sram-t-type-transmission-2.jpg 1100w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The larger roller diameter means the well between teeth must be a bit larger, too, so that the chain can fully settle in between teeth and give the rollers maximum engagement on the driving side of each tooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available sizes and claimed weights are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>28T – 54g</p>\n\n\n\n<p>30T – 58g</p>\n\n\n\n<p>32T – 64g</p>\n\n\n\n<p>34T – 71g</p>\n\n\n\n<p>36T – 78g</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices are $105.95 (€96.95 / £85.99), and they’re available in black, titanium (shown), gold, and red. They have a 3mm offset to match the recommended 55mm chainline and use SRAM’s 8-bolt direct-mount interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re available now for pre-order, shipping July 5th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://absoluteblack.cc/sram-oval-t-type-direct-mount-transmission-chainring/\" target=\"_blank\">absoluteBLACK.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/absoluteblack-adds-oval-chainrings-for-sram-t-type-mtb-groups/\">absoluteBLACK adds Oval Chainrings for SRAM T-Type MTB groups</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"44810642f8d22b5c364d307f1110e63d601afd1ec86541428b0aa359b186de32","category":"Cycling"}
