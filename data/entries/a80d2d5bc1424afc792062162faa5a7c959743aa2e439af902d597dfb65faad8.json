That’s because it assessed them under multiple categories.</p>\n<p>There are also a few helmets that are skate certified and/or snow sports certified as well as being designed for cycling.</p>\n<p>The eagle-eyed will note the one helmet that doesn’t have MIPS in its name is the Lazer Anverz NTA. That’s because it’s designed for ebike riders, with the ‘NTA’ suffix signifying that it passes the Dutch NTA ebike helmet standard, which is tougher than that for regular cycles – and the Anverz NTA does indeed include MIPS in any case.</p>\n<ol><li><span>Specialized Mode MIPS</span></li>\n<li><span>Specialized Align II MIPS</span></li>\n<li><span>Scott Centric Plus MIPS</span></li>\n<li><span>Lazer Cyclone MIPS</span></li>\n<li><span>Scott ARX Plus MIPS 2020</span></li>\n<li><span>Lazer Anverz NTA</span></li>\n<li><span>Bontrager Solstice MIPS</span></li>\n<li><span>Lazer Cruizer MIPS</span></li>\n<li><span>Bern Union MIPS</span></li>\n<li><span>Lazer Cannibal MIPS</span></li>\n</ol><h2>All the top tens include MIPS</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Helmets with a MIPS liner rule the roost.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One word appears in all but one of the helmet names above, and that’s MIPS.</p>\n<p>In part, this reflects just how prevalent MIPS is in the cycle helmet market now, but also the MIPS patent’s overall dominance in sliding plane technology in helmets.</p>\n<p>It’s designed to help dissipate energy in oblique impacts so that less of the impact force is transferred to the rider. Many bike crashes involve oblique impacts to the head and Virginia Tech’s testing suggests that extra protection from this type of crash is an important feature.</p>\n<h2>The majority of tested helmets rank highly</h2>\n<p><span>Another take-away is just how many of the tested helmets are highly ranked by Virginia Tech. Its methodology includes a formula to assign a star rating, so it’s not just an arbitrary number.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of the 138 helmets tested, 72 were rated five stars – that’s 52 per cent. A further 37 – or 27 per cent – were rated four stars. </span></p>\n<p><span>This means that, overall, 80 per cent of the helmets tested achieved Virginia Tech’s recommended level of five- or four-star protection.</span></p>\n<p><span>You don’t have to spend a fortune to get a helmet that will protect you well either. Virginia Tech quotes a price of just $65 for the top-rated road helmet – the Giant Rev Comp MIPS – while four of the top ten road helmets cost under $100. </span></p>\n<p><span>There are two MTB helmets costing under $100 and four urban helmets costing under $100 in their respective listings too.</span></p>\n<h2><span>How does Virginia Tech test its helmets?</span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Virginia Tech tests helmets vigorously so, hopefully, you’ll come out unscathed in crashes like this.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/petesmtbpix/\"><strong>Peter Smith </strong></a></span></div>\n<p><span>Virginia Tech’s testing uses a standard drop tower, which is the standard tool used to test bike helmets. </span></p>\n<p><span>It drops the helmet down a slider and lands it on a steel anvil. Virginia Tech covers this with coarse sandpaper, which it says helps to better simulate real-life road conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span>Tests are carried out at two different impact speeds and in six different positions on the helmet, including on the rim. </span></p>\n<p><span>The method tests oblique impacts as well as those taken head-on. Each test is repeated twice, for a total of 24 tests on each helmet.</span></p>\n<p><span>Accelerometers are positioned inside the headform on which the helmet is mounted to measure the linear and rotational forces acting on impact. </span></p>\n<p><span>A formula is then used to convert this data into an overall score and a star rating, with a lower score being better.</span></p>\n<p><span>Virginia Tech says that its testing is more complete than standard tests, which do not include impacts on the rim, although this is often where contact will occur in a crash.
