Most generative AI model development tasks need accelerated compute resources in parallel. Our customers struggle to find timely access to compute resources to complete their training within their timeline and budget constraints.</p> \n<p>With today’s announcement, you can find the required accelerated compute resources for training, create the most optimal training plans, and run training workloads across different blocks of capacity based on the availability of the compute resources. Within a few steps, you can identify training completion date, budget, compute resources requirements, create optimal training plans, and run fully managed training jobs, without needing manual intervention.</p> \n<p><u><strong>SageMaker HyperPod training plans in action</strong></u><br /> To get started, go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">Amazon SageMaker AI console</a>, choose <strong>Training plans</strong> in the left navigation pane, and choose <strong>Create training plan</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/12/02/2024-sagemaker-hyperpod-training-plans-1-get-started-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2344\" height=\"1396\" /></p> \n<p>For example, choose your preferred training date and time (10 days), instance type and count (16 <code>ml.p5.48xlarge</code>) for SageMaker HyperPod cluster, and choose <strong>Find training plan</strong>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/12/02/2024-sagemaker-hyperpod-training-plans-2-find-plans-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2214\" height=\"1530\" /></p> \n<p>SageMaker HyperPod suggests a training plan that is split into two five-day segments. This includes the total upfront price for the plan.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/29/2024-sagemaker-hyperpod-training-plans-3-plan-segments-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1194\" height=\"1066\" /></p> \n<p>If you accept this training plan, add your training details in the next step and choose <strong>Create</strong> your plan.</p> \n<p>After creating your training plan, you can see the list of training plans. When you’ve created a training plan, you have to pay upfront for the plan within 12 hours. One plan is in the <strong>Active</strong> state and already started, with all the instances being used. The second plan is <strong>Scheduled</strong> to start later, but you can already submit jobs that start automatically when the plan begins.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/12/02/2024-sagemaker-hyperpod-training-plans-4-training-plans-scheduled.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1760\" height=\"1180\" /></p> \n<p>In the active status, the compute resources are available in SageMaker HyperPod, resume automatically after pauses in availability, and terminates at the end of the plan. There is a first segment currently running and another segment queued up to run after the current segment.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/12/02/2024-sagemaker-hyperpod-training-plans-5-experiment-training-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1736\" height=\"2584\" /></p> \n<p>This is similar to the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-managed-spot-training.html\">Managed Spot training in SageMaker AI</a>, where SageMaker AI takes care of instance interruptions and continues the training with no manual intervention.
