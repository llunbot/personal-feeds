The cutout for the Side button matches <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/16/iphone-15-pro-renders/\">renders of the iPhone 15 Pro</a>, which is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/\">move to solid-state buttons</a> with haptic feedback, but this is the first time it has been seen in real-world images.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear whether the image shows a standard ‌iPhone 15‌ or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> model. The chassis seems to be anodized in a black or \"Midnight\" color with a matte finish, which would indicate a standard ‌iPhone 15‌ model, in contrast to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/16/iphone-15-pro-usb-c-port/\">brushed titanium finish</a>. On the other hand, only this year's \"Pro\" models are expected to get solid-state buttons.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is likely the case that the image does actually show a standard ‌iPhone 15‌ model, and the cutout is actually designed for a mechanical button, since the two standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models are not expected to get haptic buttons this year. Leaker ShrimpApplePro has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1633098024028127238\">suggested</a> that the chassis could actually be a modification casing designed for an older ‌iPhone‌ model, so the image should be taken with a pinch of salt at the current time.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/iphone-15-image-shows-black-finish-and-side-button/\">Alleged Real-World iPhone 15 Chassis Image Shows Black Finish and Side Button Cutout</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-real-world-iphone-15-chassis-image-shows-black-finish-and-side-button-cutout.2383001/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1f6f0f21148079aa2530938d3e20f1f8800b21c404068192904643d5a1e4f7bd","category":"Apple"}
