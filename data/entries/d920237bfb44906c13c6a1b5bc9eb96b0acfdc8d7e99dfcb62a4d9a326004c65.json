{"title":"The MacRumors Show: iPhone 16e Announced!","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/the-macrumors-show-iphone-16e/","date":1740156150000,"content":"On this week's episode of <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/apples-iphone-16e-love-it-or-hate-it/id1602394741?i=1000694785019\">The MacRumors Show</a>, we unpack Apple's announcement of the all-new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16e‌ is the newest member of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup, offering a massive upgrade over the now-discontinued third-generation ‌iPhone‌ SE. It features a 6.1-inch OLED display with a notch for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, a Ceramic Shield front cover, a USB-C port, and an Action button, and much more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is powered by an A18 chip, enabling support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features, such as notification summaries and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> for creating custom emoji. It also supports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/\">Visual Intelligence</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the ‌iPhone 16e‌, the A18 chip has a 6-core CPU and a 16-core Neural Engine, but a binned 4-core GPU, making it slightly less powerful than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus. It also has IP68-rated water resistance, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.3. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device is equipped with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">Apple-designed 5G modem called the C1</a>, whereas other iPhones have a Qualcomm modem. Apple says its own modem is so power efficient that the ‌iPhone 16e‌ offers the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch ‌iPhone‌ model ever at up to 26 hours.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the back of the ‌iPhone 16e‌ is a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera, which provides a 2x \"optical-quality\" Telephoto option, according to Apple. On the front, there is a 12-megapixel camera with autofocus. The device does not have the Camera Control button that was introduced across the rest of the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup last year. It also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-doesnt-have-magsafe/\">lacks MagSafe</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPhone 16e‌ supports Apple's satellite features. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ supports Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> via satellite. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe device is available in white or black, and with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage capacities. In the U.S., pricing starts at $599. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe talk through how the ‌iPhone 16e‌ compares to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 16‌, which sit at $699 and $799, respectively. We also contemplate what the discontinuation of the ‌iPhone‌ SE line means for the rumored third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, which is rumored to launch later this year. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube
