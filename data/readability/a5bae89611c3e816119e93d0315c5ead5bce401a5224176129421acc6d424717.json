The bike’s standout feature is its versatility, letting you simply swap between road and gravel wheels and tires to essentially have two bikes in one.</p><p>Now, you can own more than just a bike by buying into the company through their Start Engine equity crowdfunding campaign…</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3KItpFGOis?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>With a minimum investment of $248, you’ll own part of the company, but perks start at $500 and up. From hats and bonus shares all the way up to a complete bike with Shimano Ultegra Di2.</p><p>In addition to banking on the continued growth of the gravel segment, and catering to riders who want one good bike to ride all the drop-bar things, they’re planning to expand into gravel e-bikes, too. Considering those are the two fastest growing segments (gravel, and e-bikes, separately), it’s maybe not a bad idea.</p><p>As with most bike brands, demand has outpaced supply, and their next batch of frames arrives by end of 2021, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/blackheart-allroad-aluminum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the aluminum models</a> should start shipping in Q1 2022. Their direct-to-consumer business model gives them ample margins and good prices, which has helped them grow to $180,000 in YTD 2021 sales (their figures, not ours).</p><p>You can check out <a href=\"https://www.startengine.com/blackheart-bike-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blackheart’s Start Engine Campaign</a> for more details.
