{"title":"Apple Working on New 27-Inch Mini-LED Studio Display for Late 2025","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/","date":1739470626000,"content":"Apple is working on a 27-inch mini-LED display that could come as soon as late 2025, display analyst <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1890099697811091590\">Ross Young said today</a>. The display could be a new version of the Studio Display that Apple first introduced in 2022. The current version of the Studio Display uses a 5K LED panel, so a mini-LED version would be a significant update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/studio-display-purple.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nYoung says that the display will use mini-LED panels from Epistar, while LG Display will manufacture it for Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in 2023, Young claimed that Apple had been working on a Studio Display Pro with ProMotion technology, but Apple allegedly canceled the project. Young at the time said that Apple wasn't working on another 27-inch display, but Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has maintained that Apple plans to launch some kind of display in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already uses mini-LED technology for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>. Compared to LED, mini-LED displays feature superior brightness, contrast, and color accuracy. The ‌MacBook Pro‌ display, for example, uses more than 10,000 mini-LEDs for deeper blacks, more detail in shadows, and improved highlights.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new 27-inch mini-LED display could be introduced at the end of 2025 or in early 2026. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">Apple Working on New 27-Inch Mini-LED Studio Display for Late 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-new-27-inch-mini-led-studio-display-for-late-2025.2449331/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8c15c21f28f3a9e604f3d652fdf6be290f77aee105427402148846a61da7e4f9","category":"Apple"}
