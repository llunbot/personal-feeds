But a report today from a well-known source finally adds some intrigue to the next round of watches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/PkEqB8dkU\">user Instant Digital on Weibo</a> (as spotted by MacRumors), Apple may be working on a completely new Apple Watch “with a glass frame, which supports touch interaction.” Currently, the Apple Watch Series 10 has an aluminum frame while the Apple Watch Ultra is made of titanium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumor includes little in the way of details but does note that Apple is looking to bring the all-glass enclosure to the Apple Watch before the iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has experimented with various materials for the Apple Watch over the years, including ceramic and solid gold, but an all-glass frame would be a major change. While the watch would likely look the same, an all-glass enclosure would let Apple design a single one-piece design that blurs the line between screen, sensors, and buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/2021/11/apple-wins-patent-revealing-possible-future-all-glass-iphone-that-allows-imagery-on-both-front-backsides-plus-an-all-glass.html\">exploring all-glass devices for decades</a> and already has products, like the AirPods 4, with touch-sensitive controls. But since its launch in 2015, the Apple Watch has had physical side buttons and a Digital Crown with a display that supports multi-touch gestures. The Apple Watch Ultra adds a second Action button on the left side that is customizable for a variety of uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were reports last year that Apple was considering a radical new Apple Watch Series X to celebrate its 10th anniversary, but the Series 10 was another in a long line of incremental updates.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c33fa7a65c9a2b7e86595fdcd2858c56eb1da6a41a04c591aa79e782f4fd057e","category":"Apple"}
