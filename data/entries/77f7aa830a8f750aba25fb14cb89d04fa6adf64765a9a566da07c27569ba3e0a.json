Here, in our best Mac for students guide, we take a look at Apple’s current line-up to evaluate which Mac is best for students. We’ll compare the MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro for college and examine whether a desktop Mac might actually be a better choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the best Mac for college or university depends on what you are going to be studying as well as how much you have to spend. Luckily registered students can save money on a new Mac by shopping at Apple’s Education Store, or with one of Apple’s partners. We discuss <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">How to get an Apple student discount at Apple’s Education Store</a> separately, although we also talk about the different ways you can save money as a student below.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save hundreds on a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and even a Mac Pro at Apple’s Education Store all year round. Click on the following links for the Education stores in the countries where most of our readers reside:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.S. Education Store</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk-edu/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.K. Education Store</a> (in the UK you will need to verify your student status via UNiDAYS).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Canada Education Store</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/au-hed/store\">Apple’s Australian Education Store</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While students can get money off all year round, in the summer months Apple gives away either vouchers or AirPods with purchases of Macs or iPads made by those in higher education. The Back to School deal (called Back to Uni in the U.K. and elsewhere so as not to suggest it is for school age children) runs from June to end of September in the U.S., July to mid October in the U.K. and Europe, and January to March in Australia and New Zealand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a student, you can also get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674847/students-can-get-apple-tv-free-with-half-price-apple-music.html\">Apple Music for half price</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673723/how-to-get-apple-tv-plus-free.html\">free Apple TV+</a> included.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Back to School 2023 image\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-back-to-school-2023.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Buy a Mac   or iPad for university during the summer months and take advantage of Apple’s Higher Education deal. </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll run through exactly how much money you can save on a new Mac if you are a student below, then we will assess which Mac to choose based on your needs as a student and the course you are taking.

Savings are even bigger on high-end products like the Mac Pro, although we aren’t sure that many students need one of those. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Product</strong></th><th>U.S.</th><th>U.K.</th><th>Australia</th><th>Canada</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2, MSRP</td><td>$999</td><td>£999</td><td>$1,599</td><td>$1,299</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2, Student discount</td><td>$899</td><td>£899</td><td>$1,439</td><td>$1,169</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3, MSRP</td><td>$1,099</td><td>£1,099</td><td>$1,799</td><td>$1,449</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3, Student discount</td><td>$999</td><td>£999</td><td>$1,649</td><td>$1,299</td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air, M3, MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,299</td><td>$2,199</td><td>$1,749</td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air, M3, Student discount</td><td>$1,199</td><td>£1,199</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$1,599</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro M4 MSRP</td><td>$1,599</td><td>£1,599</td><td>$2,499</td><td>$2,099</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro M4 Student discount</td><td>$1,499</td><td>£1,499</td><td>$2,349</td><td>$1,969</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro MSRP</td><td>$1,999</td><td>£1,999</td><td>$3,299</td><td>$2,699</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro Student discount</td><td>$1,849</td><td>£1,849</td><td>$3,069</td><td>$2,509</td></tr><tr><td>16-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro MSRP</td><td>$2,499</td><td>£2,499</td><td>$3,999</td><td>$3,299</td></tr><tr><td>16-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro Student discount</td><td>$2,299</td><td>£2,299</td><td>$3,699</td><td>$3,049</td></tr><tr><td>iMac M4 MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,299</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$1,699</td></tr><tr><td>iMac M4 Student discount</td><td>$1,249</td><td>£1,249</td><td>$1,919</td><td>$1,629</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini M4 MSRP</td><td>$599</td><td>£599</td><td>$999</td><td>$799</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini M4 Student discount</td><td>$499</td><td>£499</td><td>$849</td><td>$669</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Studio M2 Max MSRP</td><td>$1,999</td><td>£2,099</td><td>$3,299</td><td>$2,699</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Studio M2 Max Student discount</td><td>$1,799</td><td>£1,889</td><td>$2,969</td><td>$2,429</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Pro M2 Max MSRP</td><td>$6,999</td><td>£7,199</td><td>$11,999</td><td>$8,999</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Pro M2 Max Student discount</td><td>$6,599</td><td>£6,789</td><td>$11,309</td><td>$8,479</td></tr><tr><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Apple’s discounted price for students compared to the usual price.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro for college/university?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely the question you are hoping to get an answer to: should I buy a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro for college?

That changed in with the introduction of the M4 MacBook Pro in October 2024, but it is unlikely to be long until Apple updates the MacBook Air with the same chip. If you don’t want to wait for the M4 MacBook Air, this is still a good choice, especially because Apple increased the amount on RAM (unified memory) included from 8GB to 16GB in October 2024 without changing the price. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a MacBook that doesn’t break the bank and offers the ultimate in portability and great battery life, then the MacBook Air is the perfect fit. The model we are recommending here is not the cheapest MacBook Air, but it offers the best value for money and the price difference between this and the older M2 model is so small that it is one of those cases where spending a little more gets you a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>This MacBook Air offers 18 hours of battery life, according to Apple. This is less than the 13-inch MacBook Pro’s 20 hours, but it’s sure to be enough to get you through a day and an all-nighter at university.</p>\n\n<p>There are no USB-A ports on the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, just two USB-C, a headphone jack, and a MagSafe port so you can charge your laptop and still have two USB ports free. </p>\n\n<p>You may feel that you need more storage than the entry-level model offers, in which case, the 512GB model costs $200/£200 more. Previously there were additional benefits to choosing the 512GB version because Apple’s smaller SSDs weren’t as fast as the larger ones, but for the M3 MacBook Air Apple seems to have addressed this issue. Rather than fork out for extra storage built-in you may find external storage, or even iCloud storage, works out cheaper. (If you have a big Music library, for example, pay for iTunes Match so you can keep your music in the cloud. If you have a big photo library turn on iCloud Photos and get additional <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672409/how-much-does-icloud-cost.html\">iCloud storage</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Air, M3? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$1,799 / CA$1,449<br />Student: $999 / £999 / AU$1,649 / CA$1,299</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £100 / AU$150 / CA$150</em></p>\n\n<p>You’ll see the best prices right now in the block above, which may be even better than Apple’s education pricing. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

The thing about the MacBook Air is that it lacks a fan, which means that if you really push it then the Mac might slow down to avoid overheating. For this reason, if you want to use your Mac for heavy processing then you might be better off with a MacBook Pro. In this case, if you have the budget, you might actually want to consider the M4 Pro option (discussed next).</p>\n\n<p>One other benefit of the MacBook Pro is the wider selection of ports than on the MacBook Air, including HDMI and an SDXC card reader. But if you aren’t doing anything too demanding then the MacBook Air is going to be more than powerful enough for your needs and we’d suggest that you save the money you’d be spending on the MacBook Pro and buy an external display to plug into when you are back in your dorm room, or something equally as useful (like food). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 14-inch MacBook Pro, M4? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,599 / £1,599 / AU$2,499 / CA$2,099<br />Student: $1,499 / £1,499 / AU$2,349 / CA$1,969</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £100 / AU$150 / CA$130</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2510333/14-inch-m4-macbook-pro-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.

That’s $100/£100 less than the student price of the newer M3 MacBook Air. Even better, Apple upped the RAM (unified memory) from 8GB to 16GB as standard in October 2024 without increasing the price, so this is still a good Mac to buy if you are on a budget.  </p>\n\n<p>That’s not a huge saving though, so we suggest you shop around a bit before you buy: you may find a discount on the M3 13-inch MacBook Air that beats Apple’s Student discount on the older model. Just make sure that you note whether there is 8GB or 16GB RAM inside when deciding whether a deal is good enough.  </p>\n\n<p>If you can spare the extra money, we recommend spending the extra $100/£100 because the M3 MacBook Air is the better purchase thanks to the newer M3 chip and faster storage. Our advice is to avoid the 256GB M2 MacBook Air because the storage is known to be slower. We’d recommend upgrading to the 512GB model, but by that point, you might as well spend the money on the M3 MacBook Air which isn’t hampered by the same storage issue. </p>\n\n<p>But, if you can’t spare the extra money the M2 MacBook Air will be more than adequate for a student, especially those predominantly writing essays and conducting research. This model came with a bigger and brighter screen, and better FaceTime cameras than its predecessor, and still has a lot of benefits compared to the MacBook Pro. </p>\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air offers 18 hours of battery life, just like the M3 model. That is less than the 13-inch MacBook Pro’s 20 hours, but it is enough to get you through a day and an all-nighter at university. It offers the same ports as the M3 MacBook Air: two USB-C, a headphone jack, and a MagSafe port for charging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Air, M2? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $999 / £999 / AU$1,599 / CA$1,299<br />Student: $899 / £899 /AU$1,439 / CA$1,169</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £100 / AU$160 / CA$1</em>3<em>0</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>MacBook vs Mac desktop for students?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Student life normally involves a fair amount of mobility – traveling to lectures, libraries, the occasional coffee shop, and then possibly home for weekends and term breaks–so it makes sense to consider a laptop rather than a desktop Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the screen sizes in MacBooks are smaller than iMacs, you can always buy a cheap screen and use that with your laptop when you are home. Or, if you also have an iPad, you might be able to link your iPad to your MacBook and use the iPad screen too (here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671945/how-to-use-an-ipad-as-a-second-monitor.html\">how to use your iPad as a second screen for your Mac</a>).

Generally, it is the case that you pay more for a Mac laptop, compared to the same specs on a desktop. The Mac mini, for example, is Apple’s cheapest Mac despite having some pretty impressive specs.

That 24-inch display could also be a great screen for streaming your favorite shows and movies. </p>\n\n<p>The iMac is a non-portable Mac though, which might deter many students from purchasing one.

However, we’d wait until Apple updates it with the M4 chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could save by opting for the older M2 MacBook Air, but, if you are looking for the cheapest Mac you can get, the M4 Mac mini is a very good option. It’s powerful and with Apple’s education discount, it’s just $499/£499. You just need a monitor, mouse and keyboard. The only reason to delay buying one is the fact that a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a> may be coming soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get a discount on a Mac for university or school</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get a student discount at Apple’s education stores, but you have to qualify as a student in higher education, be a teacher, someone buying for an education institution, or a home educator. School-age children can only take advantage if the equipment is being purchased by their school or if their parent is home-educating them. If you are a registered student you’ll be able to get a discount on a new Mac if you shop in Apple’s various Education Stores (below).

There are various ways to get a bargain:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Look out for reseller discounts</strong>: Another way to get a bargain is to look out for deals at Apple resellers and Amazon, where we have see Macs with as much as $500 off the price.

The benefit of buying refurbished from Apple is that the products are fully checked and come with a one-year warranty. You can also get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/where-to-buy-a-refurbished-macbook-or-mac.html\">a refurbished Mac</a> elsewhere with many resellers offering the same service, but beware that not all refurbished Macs are equal. Usually refurbished means that the Mac is guaranteed to be in full working order, but do check with the reseller. Here’s a guide to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/where-to-buy-a-refurbished-macbook-or-mac.html\">how to buy a refurbished Mac.</a> We also look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673929/why-you-should-buy-a-refurbished-mac.html\">why you should buy a refurbished Mac.</a> One thing to note: if you find what you think is a good deal on an older Intel Mac we do not recommend that you buy one. Intel Macs will likely only be supported with security updates for a couple more years, so you may find yourself needing to upgrade before the end of your course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buy second-hand/used</strong>: One advantage of buying refurbished is that it should be guaranteed to work and you should have no problem returning it if there is a problem. These are reasons why we don’t recommend buying <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678277/why-you-shouldnt-buy-a-second-hand-mac.html\">a secondhand Mac</a>. If you do see a deal on a secondhand or used Mac just be especially cautious. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best Mac bargains are usually on older models, although we do see discounts on current Macs as well. If you see a good discount on an older Mac it’s important to be aware of what the newer models offers so that you know what you are missing out on and can judge whether the deal is as good as it appears to be. For one thing, older Macs are likely to feature Intel processors rather than Apple’s M1, M2, M3 or their variants, which could put you at a disadvantage in the future (and will certainly mean your Mac depreciates in value very quickly). Considering an Intel Mac? Our advice is: avoid.
