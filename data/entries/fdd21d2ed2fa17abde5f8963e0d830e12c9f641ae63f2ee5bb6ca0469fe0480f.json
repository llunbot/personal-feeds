The release marks the 80th anniversary of the code-breaking machines that significantly aided the Allied forces during World War II. While some in the public knew of the computers <a href=\"https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2000/1807/18070423-new.pdf\">earlier</a>, the UK <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67997406\">did not formally acknowledge</a> the project's existence until the 2000s.</p>\n\n<p>Colossus was not one computer but a series of computers developed by British scientists between 1943 and 1945. These 2-meter-tall electronic beasts played an instrumental role in breaking the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher\">Lorenz cipher</a>, a code used for communications between high-ranking German officials in occupied Europe. The computers were said to have allowed allies to \"read Hitler's mind,\" <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/scientist-brought-code-breaker-computer-colossus-back-to-life-20110904-1js8p.html\">according</a> to The Sydney Morning Herald.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Colossus-1963.jpg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            A photo of a surviving Colossus computer in 1963.

While 1945's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC\">ENIAC</a> was long considered the clear front-runner in digital computing, the revelation of Colossus' earlier existence repositioned it in computing history. (However, it's important to note that ENIAC was a general-purpose computer, and Colossus was not.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996934#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996934&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fdd21d2ed2fa17abde5f8963e0d830e12c9f641ae63f2ee5bb6ca0469fe0480f","category":"Tech"}
