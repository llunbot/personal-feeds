Pilot production runs test the assembly and refine quality control, while aligning logistics with the supply chain, with the ultimate aim of ramping up to full-scale manufacturing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the Plus model in Apple's lineup and will reportedly offer a significantly slimmer design that current iPhone models. The handset will be about two millimeters thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/\">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for size, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to fall somewhere between the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. Separate rumors have claimed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">6.55 inches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">6.6 inches</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/\">6.65 inches</a> as the display size that Apple has settled on, which would make it smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but larger than the 17 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to equip the ‌iPhone 17‌ Air with its own custom-designed 5G modem chip, which is smaller than 5G modem chips from Qualcomm. Apple has focused on making the chip more integrated with other Apple-designed components to save space within the ‌iPhone‌ without sacrificing battery life or display quality, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the rear camera will be relocated from the upper left side of the iPhone to the center of the device, as part of a \"large, centred camera bump,\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/\">according to <em>The Information</em></a>. Analyst Jeff Pu believes it will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">single 48-megapixel lens</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 17 Air will debut next year alongside a standard iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max – the Pro models of which are said to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/iphone-17-pro-redesign-backed-by-supply-chain-info/\">significant design changes of their own</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/iphone-17-air-enters-product-introduction-phase/\">iPhone 17 Air Model Enters Product Introduction Phase at Foxconn</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-model-enters-product-introduction-phase-at-foxconn.2445315/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"31d1451955ea323ed19517558dfc9192de3649a46566f2439eb605c81239d3f9","category":"Apple"}
