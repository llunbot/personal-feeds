From there, the devices run hard-to-detect malware that can download photos, contacts, text messages, and other data. The malware also allows the operator to listen to audio and view video in real time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817983#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817983&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"43a2d9d1faa820da461451c7653d71a54ff14acfd335cc61d3703f4322bdec96","category":"Tech"}
