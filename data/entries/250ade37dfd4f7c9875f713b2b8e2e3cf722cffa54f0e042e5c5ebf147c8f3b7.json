{"title":"‘Anchor Brewing Was San Francisco’","link":"https://defector.com/anchor-brewing-was-san-francisco","date":1689283118000,"content":"\n<p>Patrick Redford, writing for Defector:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is tempting to read this as another grim story about the\npandemic claiming a beloved business, given an extra bit of\napocalyptic flair by the degree to which Anchor is synonymous with\nSan Francisco. In that light, the death of one of the city’s most\niconic companies goes hand in hand with the narrative that San\nFrancisco is a dying city riven by the tripartite scourges of\n<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/san-francisco-crime-problem-runs-deeper-than-rosy-statistics-from-city\">unchecked crime</a>, spiraling unaffordability, and, uh,\n<a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/silicon-valley-bank-wokeness-17841353.php\">wokeness</a>. Even if you don’t want to go that far, you can\ncorrelate San Francisco’s high office space vacancy rates,\ndeclining <a href=\"https://www.craftbrewingbusiness.com/featured/craft-sales-continue-to-struggle-in-2023-nbwa-march-beer-purchasers-index-confirms/\">national craft beer sales</a>, and “inflation,” and\nconclude that this economy was too harsh for Anchor to survive in.\nIndeed, how can any small business keep its lights on under such\nconditions? That is the story Sapporo’s PR goons are selling and\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sfchronicle/status/1679038989121077249\">the San Francisco Chronicle</a> is buying, without any pushback\nor worker perspective, even though it’s not true. Economic\nconditions matter, though they aren’t nearly as relevant to the\nAnchor story as Sapporo’s uniquely catastrophic stewardship of the\ncompany.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A fine remembrance, replete with great links to further reading, including <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-model-for-americas-modern-craft-beer-boom-inside-the-small-brewer-scene-in-1950s-san-francisco/\">this excerpt</a> from David Burkhart’s book, published just last year, <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-anchor-brewing-story-america-s-first-craft-brewery-san-francisco-s-original-anchor-steam-beer-david-burkhart/7277948?ean=9780399581236\">The Anchor Brewing Story</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>What comes to mind is that small-scale excellence is delicate and precious. It seems unfathomable that Anchor could be losing money when their beer remains as popular as ever, but leave it to a large conglomerate like Sapporo to tank a good small thing in the name of making it a bigger thing.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/anchor-brewing-sf\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"250ade37dfd4f7c9875f713b2b8e2e3cf722cffa54f0e042e5c5ebf147c8f3b7","category":"Tech"}
