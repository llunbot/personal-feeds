Note that Apple Intelligence remains unavailable in China, while users in the EU must still have a device signed in with a US App Store ID.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence encompasses a range of capabilities, including composing text and emails, automating actions across various apps, generating images, summarizing documents and texts, and more. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-apple-intelligence-outside-us/\">How to Enable Apple Intelligence If You're Outside the US</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThese features require a lot of on-device computing power, so before you do anything, it's worth checking if your device is compatible. iPhone users need either an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max to run Apple Intelligence, while only iPads and Macs powered by M1 or later Apple silicon processors are compatible.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/29/apple-intelligence-not-region-locked-betas/\">Apple Intelligence Not Device Region Locked to US in Latest Betas</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-not-device-region-locked-to-us-in-latest-betas.2434676/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6df104c57fe6ed1e8c4f550ced19ee3e95cc01082c8eea99c23eb4c08d2a3ae0","category":"Apple"}
