While the ‌Apple TV‌ and ‌HomePod‌ would not work with the ChatKit code features added to tvOS 18.4, Apple's home accessory likely will.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">smart home \"command center\"</a> that Apple is developing is expected to have built-in Apple apps, and it's possible that one of those apps will include Messages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is worth noting that there is a shared codebase for tvOS and iOS, so this addition could mean nothing, but these ChatKit features were already included in iOS and have just been added to tvOS with the tvOS 18.4 beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's upcoming device will serve as a central hub for smart home management, but it will also support video calls, viewing photos, browsing the web, listening to music, getting news, and more. It is said to look something like an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with an all-display design, but it will be smaller, coming in at only six inches square.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers will likely be able to set it on a table or mount it on a wall, and the expectation is that there would be multiples throughout the house. It will include some sensors for features like sensing the temperature or detecting nearby people.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no concrete word on when Apple's smart home hub will launch, but it could come in the second or third quarter of 2025.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/tvos-18-4-smart-home-hub-hints/\">tvOS 18.4 Beta Further Hints at Apple's Work on Smart Home Hub</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-18-4-beta-further-hints-at-apples-work-on-smart-home-hub.2451359/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"473d452d889e28d3cc39fc33c5f8e38bb3e92a9c2af3ce4424e5baa8c42b3abf","category":"Apple"}
