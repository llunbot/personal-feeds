This marked a watershed moment for the US military and the concept of reusable rockets, as the Space Force entrusted a satellite worth about half a billion dollars to the new technology.</p>\n<p>Now, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.patrick.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2737473/innovation-is-the-game-gps-iii-5-is-the-name/\">a recent news release</a> from the US Space Force, we have a little more insight into why the Space Force is leaning into reusable rockets and other technology from innovative companies such as SpaceX.</p>\n<p>Using a refurbished booster—this particular first stage had launched a GPS III satellite in November 2020—did save the Space Force money. By agreeing to launch two of its new GPS III satellites on used rockets, essentially, the US government pocketed $52 million in cost savings. This was certainly welcome, Space Force officials said, and it's nice to have the potential to increase launch tempo.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792370#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792370&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab3675c3ab9ad722f2e8649ea9d3ee9edd66792f4142c87f395308b4e596a7ae","category":"Tech"}
