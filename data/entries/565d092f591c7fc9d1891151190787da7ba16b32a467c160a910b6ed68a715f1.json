There have been four feature films thus far, with a fifth slated for a 2024 release, plus the animated series <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_Island_(TV_series)\">Skull Island</a>,</em> which debuted on Netflix earlier this year.

San Francisco suffered quite a bit of major property damage as a result. That film also introduced us to Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other <em>kaiju</em>â€”after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed.</p>\n<p><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em> will further explore the history and aftermath of those events.
