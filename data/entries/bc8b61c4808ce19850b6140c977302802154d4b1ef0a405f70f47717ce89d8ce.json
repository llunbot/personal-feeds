{"title":"Ars Live Recap: Is SpaceX a launch company or a satellite communications company?","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032253","date":1718738542000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>Produced by Michael Toriello and Billy Keenly. <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Starlink-Conversation-Transcript.txt\">Click here for transcript</a>. </p></div>\n<p>Last week, during our inaugural Ars Live event, Quilty Space director of research Caleb Henry joined Ars space editor Eric Berger for a discussion of SpaceX's Starlink and other satellite internet systems. We discussed Starlink's rapid road to profitability—it took just five years from the first launch of operational satellites—and the future of the technology.</p>\n<p>One of the keys to Starlink's success is its vertical integration as a core business at SpaceX, which operates the world's only reusable rocket, the Falcon 9. This has allowed the company not just to launch a constellation of 6,000 satellites—but to do so at relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>\"At one point, SpaceX had publicly said that it was $28 million,\" Henry said of the company's target for a Falcon 9 launch cost. \"We believe today that they are below $20 million per launch and actually lower than that... I would put it in the mid teens for how much it costs them internally. And that's going down as they increase the reuse of the vehicle. Recently, they've launched their 20th, maybe 21st, use of a first-stage rocket. And as they can amortize the cost of the booster over a greater number of missions, that only helps them with their business case.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032253#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032253&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc8b61c4808ce19850b6140c977302802154d4b1ef0a405f70f47717ce89d8ce","category":"Tech"}
