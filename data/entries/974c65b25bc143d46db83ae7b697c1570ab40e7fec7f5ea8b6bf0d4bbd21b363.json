The first stage, with nine engines, appeared to perform nominally as it rose smoothly through the atmosphere, firing for more than two minutes. Then the rocket's second stage successfully separated.</p>\n<p>After this, <em>something</em> happened. From the video on board the rocket, it appeared the second-stage engine attempted to ignite but could not sustain this ignition. So far the company has not stated precisely what went wrong, be it a problem with one of the propellant pumps, injectors, or igniter system. Regardless, the second stage—which carried no payload due to the experimental nature of the test flight—fell back into the Atlantic Ocean.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926231#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926231&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"974c65b25bc143d46db83ae7b697c1570ab40e7fec7f5ea8b6bf0d4bbd21b363","category":"Tech"}
