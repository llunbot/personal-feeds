The DMA will have a significant impact on Apple's platforms, and it could result in Apple being forced to make major changes to the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>‌, Messages, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to be compelled to allow users to download apps from outside its official ‌App Store‌. Otherwise known as sideloading, the change would allow customers to download apps without needing to use the ‌App Store‌, which would mean developers wouldn't need to pay Apple's 15 to 30 percent fees. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is believed to be planning to implement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/\">sideloading support in iOS 17</a> to comply with the new European regulations by next year. Apple must comply with the DMA or it risks fines of as much as 20 percent of its global revenue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSetapp offers a large collection of Mac apps in a single subscription service. The company's new app store for iOS and iPadOS will ensure that users can access universal Setapp apps on other devices, as well as a range of apps new to the Setapp catalog from over 30 developers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers interested in being among the first to try Setapp's alternative app store once it is available can now <a href=\"https://setapp.com/join-waitlist\">sign up to a waiting list</a>. It will be available in the European Union only.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setapp/\">Setapp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/setapp-to-launch-alternative-app-store/\">Setapp Planning to Launch Alternative App Store for iOS in Europe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/setapp-planning-to-launch-alternative-app-store-for-ios-in-europe.2398701/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce8284ee9d39d125bae6a4ee241f7ddaca2488f1624ca0f2abb017b7ffe8b131","category":"Apple"}
