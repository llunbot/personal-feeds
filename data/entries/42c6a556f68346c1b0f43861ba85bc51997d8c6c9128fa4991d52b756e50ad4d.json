Just buy a $30 limited edition Ass Savers x Squid Win Wing Gravel fender. Squid made only 128 individual designs, in 1 of 30 different color combinations and general patterns. For that reason, some will look similar, but no two are the same. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1.jpg\" alt=\"Squid Bikes X Ass Savers limited edition artwork Win Wing Gravel bike fenders, pattern &amp; colors 1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2.jpg\" alt=\"Squid Bikes X Ass Savers limited edition artwork Win Wing Gravel bike fenders, pattern &amp; colors 2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3.jpg\" alt=\"Squid Bikes X Ass Savers limited edition artwork Win Wing Gravel bike fenders, pattern &amp; colors 3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Squid-Bikes-X-Ass-Savers-limited-edition-artwork-Win-Wing-Gravel-bike-fenders_designs-3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can only get them <a href=\"https://www.squidbikes.com/products/ass-savers-win-wing-gravel-fender\" target=\"_blank\">directly from Squid Bikes</a>, and only until all 128 sell out.
