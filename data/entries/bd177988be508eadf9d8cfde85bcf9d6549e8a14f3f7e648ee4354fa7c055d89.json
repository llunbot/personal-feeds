His rebranding of the social platform into X revives <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/fast-moving-musk-makes-very-slow-progress-turning-twitter-into-everything-app/\">a former dream he had as a PayPal co-founder </a>who fought and failed to name the now-ubiquitous payments app X. Musk has told X staff that transforming the company into a payments provider would be critical to achieving his goal of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/elon-musks-improbable-path-to-making-x-an-everything-app/\">turning X into a so-called everything app</a> \"within three to five years.\"</p>\n<p>Late last year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/elon-musk-wants-your-entire-financial-life-on-x-by-2024/\">Musk said it would \"blow\" his \"mind\"</a> if X didn't roll out payments by the end of 2024, so Bloomberg's report likely comes as no big surprise to Musk's biggest fans who believe in his vision. At that time, Musk said he wanted X users' \"entire financial lives\" on the platform before 2024 ended, and a Bloomberg review of \"more than 350 pages of documents and emails related to money transmitter licenses that X Payments submitted in 11 states\" shows approximately how close he is to making that dream a reality on his platform.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032306#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032306&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bd177988be508eadf9d8cfde85bcf9d6549e8a14f3f7e648ee4354fa7c055d89","category":"Tech"}
