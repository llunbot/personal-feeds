Every single month since June, the globe has experienced the hottest temperatures for that month on record—that's 11 months in a row now, enough to ensure that 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 will likely be similarly extreme.</p>\n<p>There's been nothing like this in the temperature record, and it acts as an unmistakable indication of human-driven warming. But how unusual is that warming compared to what nature has thrown at us in the past? While it's not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to that question, three European researchers (Jan Esper, Max Torbenson, and Ulf Büntgen) have provided a partial answer: the Northern Hemisphere hasn't seen anything like this in over 2,000 years.</p>\n<h2>Tracking past temperatures</h2>\n<p>Current temperature records are based on a global network of data-gathering hardware. But, as you move back in time, gaps in that network go from rare to ever more common. Moving backwards from 1900, the network shrinks to just a few dozen land-based thermometers, almost all of them in Europe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024443#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024443&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a255085d780dd84c71aa30ec26c4ef976a2777f92fa82f0ac4b45d95f233514","category":"Tech"}
