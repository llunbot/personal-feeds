Small cloud vendors in the US charge about $10 an hour for the same setup.</p>\n<p>The low prices, according to people in the AI and cloud industry, are an indication of plentiful supply of Nvidia chips in China and the circumvention of US measures designed to prevent access to cutting-edge technologies.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047945#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047945&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5bb82b1fc09647cfdc30cb077c149f121a55558ae79f1b4a940bc742eed0412b","category":"Tech"}
