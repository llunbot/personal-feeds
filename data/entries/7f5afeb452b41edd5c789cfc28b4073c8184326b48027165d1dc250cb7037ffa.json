We even spotted some pretty killer leaks of it on Twitter back in January. And now it seems like SRAM isn’t even trying to hide it anymore. They posted this photo of Lidl-Trek’s Jonathan Milan winning stage 4 of the Giro d’Italia on their Facebook, with what looks like those leaked levers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, a few of their sponsored teams are posting photos of bikes equipped with an unreleased groupset. And now SRAM’s own social media is teasing #newSRAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New SRAM Red AXS, coming super soon?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/newSRAM-road-bike-teaser.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/newSRAM-road-bike-teaser.jpg\" alt=\"unreleased new SRAM Red road bike groupset, teased by SRAM\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/newSRAM-road-bike-teaser.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/newSRAM-road-bike-teaser-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/newSRAM-road-bike-teaser-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/newSRAM-road-bike-teaser-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sramroad\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last completely new SRAM Red eTap AXS groupset came out more than <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-red-etap-axs-12-speed-wireless-road-bike-group-complete-technical-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">5 years ago</a>.
