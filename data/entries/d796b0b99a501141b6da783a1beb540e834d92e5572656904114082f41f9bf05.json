The M2 fulfills the exact carry-on requirements of European airlines and it’s perfect for business travelers and photographers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put the Venturing Observer M2 through its paces, I took it on several trips. Anyone who is used to typical trolleys will be amazed with the Venturing Observer M2. The large main compartment has a variable intermediate shelf. There are two large mesh compartments on the inside of the lid, which offer space for T-shirts or vests. Our M2 had “the so-called “Clothing Cubes” that are used to make pockets in the compartment sized for shirts, underwear, or shoes. It’s an ideal sorting system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outer pocket adapts slightly to the contents, in addition to a protected compartment large enough for a 16-inch MacBook Pro or 15-inch MacBook Air. There’s another compartment for an iPad and there’s still enough space for travel documents or reading material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outer compartment has eyelets for a lock and the main compartment already has a permanently installed lock. Another lock with a steel cable is hidden in the side pocket. This is used to secure the trolley to a pole or a safety hook on a couch in the airport building, for example. The trolley is then protected from thieves during a nap. There is also space for a water bottle in the side pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 30\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_30.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>There is also a notebook backpack to match the Trolles.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Cubes 01\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_Cubes_01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The cubes, pockets for laundry, are very practical.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 49\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_49.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The castors are very quiet.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 58\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_58.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>A cable lock is used to secure valuable luggage.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 36\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_36.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>With a photo backpack such as the Backlight Spring, the Venturing Observer M2 becomes a photo trolley.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 46\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_46.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 45\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_45.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The front pocket replaces a notebook backpack.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 47\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_47.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Venturing Observer 2M Gear Three Quarters Gear\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Venturing-Observer-2M-Gear-Three-Quarters-Gear.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1116\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank VenturingObserver 48\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thinktank_VenturingObserver_48.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>A cable lock is used to secure valuable luggage.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Venturing Observer Floating Compression Divider 8\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Venturing-Observer-Floating-Compression-Divider-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A telescopic handle is just as common among trolleys, as is scratch protection on the back and two sturdy wheels. There is a small compartment for an iPhone on the top, below the well-padded handle. However, we used the compartment for an AirTag and keys. Another well-padded handle is on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use as a photo trolley</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Venturing Observer M2 can also be used as a photo trolley. The <a href=\"https://www.thinktankphoto.com/products/backlight-sprint\">Backlight Sprint</a> photo backpack from Thinktank fits perfectly into the main compartment. This provides optimum protection for the camera. To get to the camera, you don’t have to remove the backpack, just open the zips of the camera compartment on it. You can then access your equipment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main compartment of the Venturing Observer M2 offers space for photo accessories such as filters, batteries, a drone, chargers, and more in addition to the photo backpack. We packed all the accessories in so-called gear pouches from Thinktank and distributed them next to the photo backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Think Tank Venturing Observer M2?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The many compartments for laptops, tablets, and documents in the outer compartment clearly set the Venturing Observer M2 apart from the mass of trolleys. The Clothing Cubes are an ingenious solution for anyone who wants to keep their shirts and underwear well protected. The robust construction, quiet wheels, the integrated cable lock to secure the trolley, and the external compartment for a water bottle are much appreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on </em><a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2377062/thinktank-venturing-observer-test.html\"><em>Macwelt</em></a><em> and was translated by </em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\"><em>Roman Loyola</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d796b0b99a501141b6da783a1beb540e834d92e5572656904114082f41f9bf05","category":"Apple"}
