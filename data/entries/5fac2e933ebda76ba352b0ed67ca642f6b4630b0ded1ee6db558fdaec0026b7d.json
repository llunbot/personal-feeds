Remember that flurry of hype and optimism last June? We were all younger then, and how we wanted to believe! But now we are older and wiser, and a great deal more cynical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How will we look back on those past 12 months? Not positively, I fear. Your AI tools are both ambitious and real, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea, we might say, but the parts that are real are not ambitious, while the ambitious parts are a load of phony-baloney vaporware codswallop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a point made last week (albeit in slightly different words) by Daring Fireball’s Jon Gruber, in a <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino\">quietly devastating takedown</a> of those AI promises at WWDC 24. He observed that Apple Intelligence is an arbitrary umbrella term used to conflate two separate sets of software offerings: those that Apple was happy to demonstrate and have since been launched to the public; and those that have not yet been seen by anyone outside Cupertino and may never launch. The cynics among us can guess which set contains the most interesting and groundbreaking features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with Apple Intelligence, to coin another sub-Johnsonian aphorism, is that it was simultaneously unveiled both too early and too late. It was too early because it wasn’t ready—even the most basic planks in the system weren’t available at the launch of the iPhone 16 three months later (which was heavily marketed on the strength of those missing AI features). And it was too late because so many other companies were much further down the AI road. Apple already looked silly for not announcing anything before WWDC, which is probably why the keynote scriptwriters let their imaginations run away with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the two issues, the earliness is by far the worst. Making promises and then failing to deliver, as Gruber writes, is a dangerous game, because it undermines the faith of your customers—both the existing and potential ones. An industry based around free software updates and rapid security fixes relies on trust. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A company that asks you to spend $1,000 on a phone you intend to use for three years but has a warranty that lasts only one is selling belief as well as hardware. And a company that says you’ll have certain features on your iPhone 16 and then makes you wait <em>until the iPhone 17</em> for the best of them might not be a company you can rely on. In the end, Apple’s word is all it has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite ever pieces of journalism is an <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter\">interview from 2015</a> in which the British games writer John Walker sorrowfully eviscerates Peter Molyneux, a legendary designer he once admired. (I don’t use the word eviscerate lightly. The opening question is “Do you think that you’re a <em>pathological</em> liar?”) In a 15-year sequence of astonishing creativity, Molyneux was a rockstar who created <em>Populous</em>, <em>Syndicate</em>, <em>Theme Park</em>, <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, and <em>Fable</em>. But then he spent the next decade squandering his reputation by overpromising and underdelivering on a series of disastrous projects. He became far better at talking about the games he was going to make than actually making them. By the time of the interview, his fanciful promises had become an industry meme and a <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterMolydeux\">Twitter account</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>.I would say that Peter Molyneux is a cautionary tale of which Apple should take careful heed. In the games industry, you can get away with hyperbole for much longer, especially when you have a solid body of work behind you (<em>see Grand Theft Auto VI</em>). But if a significant portion of the world’s iPhone buyers start to doubt Apple can be trusted to deliver on its promises, the fall could be much more rapid—let’s see how many people believe the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> ads this fall The stakes are a lot higher when you’re the biggest tech company in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won’t pretend to understand how and why Apple ended up so far behind in the AI race. As my colleague Jason writes in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2632386/siri-isnt-an-assistant-its-an-embarrassment.html\">another eviscerating article</a>, the company had a big head start in the personal assistant market—AI before it was called AI, essentially—and the developmental resources to engineer its way to long-term domination. That it failed to do so will remain one of the great mysteries of the tech industry. But it doesn’t really matter now how that position was squandered. What matters is how Apple responds to this failure, and it will need to start by being honest.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.
