The hottest mobile game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6riM2aDLk&amp;t=28s\">of 2016</a> remains a potent force to this day, pulling in <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/882474/pokemon-go-all-time-player-spending/\">hundreds of millions of dollars a year</a> from <a href=\"https://activeplayer.io/pokemon-go/\">tens of millions of</a> monthly active players.</p>\n<p>Part of what keeps the game fresh is a continuous trickle of new Pokémon.
