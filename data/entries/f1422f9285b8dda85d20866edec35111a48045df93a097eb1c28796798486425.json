It's not clear what exactly is considered \"slow,\" but the designation is useful for those who are seeing slow charging speeds and aren't sure why.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-slow-charger.jpg\" width=\"1534\" height=\"863\" /><em><div>Image via <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddhrju/ios_18_db1_warning_when_connected_to_a_slow/\">Reddit</a></div></em>\r<br />\nMany wireless chargers claim to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> while being limited to Qi speeds or below, so this feature could help ‌iPhone‌ users understand why their devices aren't charging at optimum speed. There does not appear to be an option to enable an alert when charging from a slow charger, which could be an arguably better feature because the battery settings are somewhat hidden.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a tappable information button that accompanies slow charging notices, but as of right now, it goes to a support document that does not yet exist.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-slow-charger-battery-settings/\">iOS 18's Battery Section Tells You If You Used a Slow Charger</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18s-battery-section-tells-you-if-you-used-a-slow-charger.2428933/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f1422f9285b8dda85d20866edec35111a48045df93a097eb1c28796798486425","category":"Apple"}
