In September 2023 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> will make its debut, and it’s expected that most iPhone users will move to the new platform pretty much straight away. But what if you want to go back to an older version of iOS? Is that even possible? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we explore what options you have when wanting to downgrade iOS on your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I downgrade from one version of iOS to another?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer to this depends on whether you want to download from a brand new version of iOS to an old version of iOS, a beta to a non-beta version, or just a point update within a few days of it being issued. In those scenarios, you can downgrade, but there is a time limit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are hoping to downgrade from iOS 16 to iOS 15, for example, that’s not something you can do anymore. And if you want to downgrade from iOS 16.6 to iOS 16.5 that won’t be possible either. The reason you can’t downgrade is that Apple is no longer ‘signing’ those versions of iOS, and these days Apple stops signing old versions of iOS within days of a new version being issued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are quick enough you might be able to downgrade from a new version of iOS to the previous version, we’ll show you how.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to downgrade from a new iOS: iOS 16.6.1 to iOS 16.6 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, we will explain how we downgraded from an iOS 16 update. We did this within days of iOS 16.6.1 being issued while Apple was still signing iOS 16.6. iOS 16.6.1 was a security update too, so we wouldn’t recommend downgrading in such a situation. Theoretically, the same process should work for any update, as long as Apple is still signing the previous version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens if you change your mind later and want to downgrade to the previous version of iOS? Downgrading is really tricky, so we can’t guarantee that even if you have the installer for an old version of the iOS you can revert to it, but here’s the method to try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this will wipe your iPhone, the only way to reinstall an older version of iOS is to wipe the current one from your device. This also means that if you restore from a backup made after the update you will be putting the newer version of iOS back on to the device. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://ipsw.me/product/iPhone&amp;xcust=1-1-2020596-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">IPSW.me</a> and download the correct version of the iOS you want that matches your iPhone model. It needs to still be signed by Apple, which these days is a very narrow window indeed. The software should start downloading to your Downloads folder. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>On your Mac, open the Finder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plug in your iPhone. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will need to turn off Find My on your device. Go to Settings and click on your ID information. Tap Find My &gt; Find My iPhone and switch the slider to off. Enter your Apple ID password.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hold down the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670647/what-is-the-option-key-on-a-mac.html\">Option/Alt key</a> and click on Restore iPhone. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>You should be able to select the version of iOS you wish to install on the iPhone from your downloads folder. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Open. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>A message will appear saying which version of iOS you will install – this should be the one you have selected. Click to confirm this and wait while your iPhone is restored.  </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The phone will be wiped and the old version of iOS installed on the iPhone. When we did this the Finder wrongly identified the version as iOS 16.6.1, but it was iOS 16.6.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You then need to set up your iPhone as a new device, so beware of this if you don’t want to run the risk of losing data.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Downgrade-iOS-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"How to downgrade iOS on iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Downgrade-iOS-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Downgrade-iOS-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=300%2C213&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Downgrade-iOS-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C544&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"725\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to downgrade from an iOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a part of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">Apple Beta Software Program</a>, it is also possible to revert from the beta version installed on your iPhone to the version of the previous iOS. But as above, you will wipe your iPhone or iPad in doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option, once the full version launches, is to leave the Beta program so that you no longer receive beta updates on your iPhone. You will then be able to install the full version of iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stop receiving beta updates follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Settings. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap General.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Software Update. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Beta Updates. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Off. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to receive beta updates again in the future just go back to this screen and select the ones you want. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover the whole process in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">how to remove an iOS beta from your iPhone</a> guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why can’t I downgrade to an older version of iOS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we said above, there is a very small window in which you can downgrade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When software is made available by Apple the company includes a signature that confirms its authenticity. This is for security reasons, so that you won’t accidentally install bogus software that claims to be iOS and then find yourself in a world of pain as all your data is stolen. Whereas in the past Apple would leave the signature valid on previous versions of iOS for a short time, in recent years the signature has been removed within days of, and sometimes almost simultaneously with, the release of the newer version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t a new scenario. At an Apple shareholder meeting back in 2016, the company’s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, was <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://sites.google.com/site/appleclubfhs/news/blog/02-26-16-heres-why-you-cant-downgrade-ios-on-your-devices#:~:text=Apple&amp;#039;s%20Senior%20Vice%20President%20of,for%20hackers%20to%20get%20into.&amp;xcust=1-1-2020596-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">reported as saying</a> that Apple did “not provide a way to downgrade largely because each iOS update improves the security of your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. To downgrade iOS means that your device would be less secure, and easier for hackers to get into.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the version of iOS you wish to reinstall doesn’t have this signature then you will not be able to install it on your iPhone or iPad. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best way to get back to a previous version of iOS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you simply <em>must</em> have a certain version of iOS, perhaps because an old app is stuck on that version and hasn’t been updated since, then there is a somewhat drastic solution. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670952/how-to-buy-second-hand-refurbished-iphone.html\">Buy an old iPhone.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds silly, but it’s probably the easiest way to ensure that you have the iOS version you need. We’d recommend scouring <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2020596-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">eBay</a> or some of the refurbished outlets like <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=1-1-2020596-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.decluttr.com/us/store/apple-iphone-store\" target=\"_blank\">Decluttr</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=renewed+cellular+phone&amp;rh=n%3A2335752011%2Cp_89%3AApple&amp;dc4&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Renewed</a> (or <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25205&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=1-1-2020596-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.backmarket.co.uk/en-gb\" target=\"_blank\">Back Market</a>, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5792&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=1-1-2020596-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.musicmagpie.co.uk/store/apple-iphone-store\" target=\"_blank\">MusicMagpie</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?i=specialty-aps&amp;srs=8362590031&amp;rh=p_89%3AApple&amp;pf_rd_i=8362590031&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Renewed</a> in the U.K.) to see if someone is selling an older model still running the iOS you want. Needless to say, you should specifically ask the buyer to confirm this–don’t just assume that the iPhone will still be running the version of iOS that was current when it launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But bear in mind, finally, that there’s a reason why Apple wants people using its latest software. Not only does this mean you get the newest features and design, but it should also be the safest one available as it has the latest updates.
