In 2014, she was a Silicon Valley superstar, and the company was valued at more than $9 billion. But as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/theranos-corrects-tens-of-thousands-of-blood-tests-voids-2-years-of-edison-results/\">technological failings</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/theranos-still-limping-smacked-with-fraud-lawsuit-by-big-mad-investor/\">fraud claims</a> came to light, the company imploded.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Holmes was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/disgraced-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-indicted-on-criminal-charges/\">indicted on criminal charges</a> and, last year, was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/elizabeth-holmes-found-guilty-on-4-of-11-charges/\">convicted</a> and sentenced to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/elizabeth-holmes-sentenced-to-11-25-years-in-prison-for-theranos-fraud/\">135 months (11 years and three months) in prison</a>. She has been ordered to report to prison on April 27. The judge in her case, US District Judge Edward Davila, has proposed that Holmes serve her sentence in a relatively cushy, minimum-security women's prison camp in Bryan, Texas, outside of Houston, though the decision of where she will serve is ultimately up to the US Bureau of Prisons.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930825#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930825&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1ad1ea5ac2b49fe76597117411e81c87f8efc1113ee824c6f0b68735c99ab651","category":"Tech"}
