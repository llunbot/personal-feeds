Chrome is able to provide \"key points\" from a webpage, along with a \"Explore on page\" section with questions and answers pulled from the content.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle says that the new \"SGE while browsing\" feature is meant to help people \"more deeply engage\" with long-form content from creators. It shows key points on articles freely available on the web, and will not summarize articles that are paywalled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of now, the new AI functionality is available on Chrome on iOS and Android devices, with Google planning to expand it to the desktop \"in the days ahead.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the near future, Google also plans to add improvements to AI-generated responses that will allow users to hover over words to preview definitions and see related diagrams or images on the topic.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/chrome-ai-article-summaries/\">Google Chrome for iOS Can Now Use AI to Summarize Articles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-for-ios-can-now-use-ai-to-summarize-articles.2398749/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dba403520c5d9f90a484af7176c8e6869920bdb5aa65cc1ed725b5e4c3ec75c5","category":"Apple"}
