At least, that's according to a trio of health and dental researchers from Brazil and the United Kingdom, led by epidemiologist and dentist Paulo Nadanovsky, of the University of the State of Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2818193\">viewpoint published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>, the researchers point out that many common—nearly unquestioned—practices in dentistry aren't backed up by solid data. That includes the typical recommendation that everyone should get a dental check-up every six months. The researchers note that two large clinical trials failed to find a benefit of six-month check-ups compared with longer intervals that were up to two years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8256238/\">A 2020 Cochrane review</a> that assessed the two clinical trials concluded that \"whether adults see their dentist for a check‐up every six months or at personalized intervals based on their dentist's assessment of their risk of dental disease does not affect tooth decay, gum disease, or quality of life. Longer intervals (up to 24 months) between check‐ups may not negatively affect these outcomes.\" The Cochrane reviewers reported that they were \"confident\" of little to no difference between six-month and risk-based check-ups and were \"moderately confident\" that going up to 24-month checkups would make little to no difference either.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022607#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022607&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0f1c33e3ff5920daf68faeac1c0902bd5aceda86ec3df42557cb0665824e59b3","category":"Tech"}
