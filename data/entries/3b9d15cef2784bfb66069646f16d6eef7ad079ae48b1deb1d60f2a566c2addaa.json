The tvOS 15.1.1 update comes one week after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/25/apple-releases-tvos-15-1/\">launch of tvOS 15.1</a>, software that brought SharePlay support to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-design-clue.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\ntvOS 15.1.1 can be downloaded over the air through the Settings app on the ‌Apple TV‌ by going to System &gt; Software Update. ‌‌‌‌‌Apple TV‌‌‌‌‌ owners who have automatic software updates enabled will be upgraded to tvOS 15.1.1 automatically.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's tvOS updates are typically minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes, performance updates, and small tweaks rather than major outward-facing changes, and we don't always know what's new.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the timing of this update, it's possible that the software addresses a bug with the SharePlay feature that came out last week. SharePlay is designed to allow content from the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app to be watched over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> with friends and family members.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple does not provide detailed release notes for its tvOS updates, but it does offer some tvOS details <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936\">through its tvOS support document</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/apple-releases-tvos-15-1-1/\">Apple Releases tvOS 15.1.1 for Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-tvos-15-1-1-for-apple-tv-hd-and-apple-tv-4k.2321183/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ADjHyRPi3-w:sMw1nvRf0i4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ADjHyRPi3-w:sMw1nvRf0i4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ADjHyRPi3-w\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3b9d15cef2784bfb66069646f16d6eef7ad079ae48b1deb1d60f2a566c2addaa","category":"Apple"}
