{"title":"Tesla’s Share Price Has Been Suspect Since Like Forever","link":"https://www.ft.com/content/9cc311b7-676b-4539-a682-b3533a76b0fc","date":1742253022000,"content":"\n<p>Tesla’s share price has been having a <a href=\"https://stocks.apple.com/Am3FIcwVVSzeUAKbtyv3F1g\">hard time of it</a> lately. The stock has lost about half its value since its all-time high back in December, and, since Musk took office alongside Donald Trump in January, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/tesla-shares-declined-every-week-since-elon-musk-went-to-washington.html\">dropped for 7 consecutive weeks</a>, rebounding only ever-so-slightly last week, after Musk got the president of the United States to turn the White House lawn into a cheesy Tesla (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thedailyshow/reel/DHHQ7xxBHgk/\">sorry, <em>Tesler</em></a>) dealership. Tesla stock dropped another 5 percent today, on a day when the overall market was slightly up.</p>\n\n<p>I bookmarked <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cc311b7-676b-4539-a682-b3533a76b0fc\">this Bryce Elder column at the Financial Times</a> back on January 31, and now seems like a good time to link to it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The usual explanation for when Tesla trading resembles a Pump.fun\nshitcoin is: “because Elon talks a lot”. Here’s JPMorgan analyst\nRyan Brinkman to expand on the theme:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s not clear to us why Tesla shares traded as much as +5%\nhigher in the aftermarket Wednesday, although we have some\nleading theories. Perhaps it was management’s statement that it\nhad identified an achievable path to becoming worth more than the\nworld’s five most valuable companies taken together (i.e., more\nthan the $14.8 trillion combined market capitalizations of Apple,\nMicrosoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, &amp; Alphabet). Or maybe it was\nmanagement’s belief that just one of its products has by itself\nthe potential to generate “north of $10 trillion in revenue”. It\nmay have even related to management guidance for 2026 (no\nfinancial targets were provided, but it was said to be “epic”)\nand for 2027 and 2028 (“ridiculously good”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Brinkman, who has a long-standing “underweight” rating on Tesla,\nis beginning to sound a bit exasperated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he company’s financial performance and Bloomberg consensus for\n   revenue, margin, earnings, and cash flow all keep coming down,\n   but analyst price targets and the company’s share price keep\n   going up. For instance, Tesla has missed Bloomberg consensus\n   EBIT in 9 of the past 10 quarters by an average of -16.3%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consistently missing estimates is one thing. What Tesla has been\ndoing is consistently missing <em>lowered</em> estimates. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Tesla’s biggest asset is hyperbole. The more extreme the\nhyperbole, the more valuable it gets. Maybe after-hours market\nparticipants understand the dynamics better than Tesla bears, so\nare primed to park fundamentals and trade on vibes. Or maybe\nsomething else entirely is going on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds a lot like the other guy at the White House Auto Mall.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/tesla-suspect\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bf16aeae38e238adac7625720b8ec0c1e7b8cef5e16a3269f470952977a6364c","category":"Tech"}
