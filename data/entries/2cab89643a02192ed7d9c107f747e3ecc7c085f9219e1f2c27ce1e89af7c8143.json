Read on for all the specs and insight into this unique build…<span></span></p>\n<p>Hey! I’m Brett and this is my <a href=\"https://southernwonders.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Y’All</a>-City <a href=\"https://allcitycycles.com/bikes/gorilla_monsoon_grx\" target=\"_blank\">Gorilla Monsoon</a>. </p>\n<p>This winter I decided to use my stimulus checks, my impending 30th birthday, and the fact I was 6 months into a new job as excuses to build up a cool new bike. I wanted something tough enough to go touring on, but snazzy enough to boost my ego a bit when cruising around town. Something quick but comfortable. Good for taking bike paths to the bar and single track on the way home. Something to plan big adventures around and something to hop on after work in whatever I’m wearing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I got the frameset from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/crankysutah\" target=\"_blank\">Cranky’s Bike Shop in Salt Lake City</a> through some very lucky timing, and over the next couple of months I ordered a lot of my favorite parts through them (thanks Chris and Luke!)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-front-dark.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-rbrake.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-rhub.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Swept back flat bars were a must on this bike. For me they’re the perfect combo of comfort and capable handling, especially when loaded. I opted to splurge for a Shimano 1×12 drivetrain because I’m not that fond of front derailleurs and because I’ve never been upset about having extra low gears. The Teravail Sparwoods are fast-rolling and sufficiently grippy. The Klampers live up to the hype and I love how the adjustment dials compliment the frame. My trusty Brooks Flyer seals the deal, but honestly I’m pumped about every single component.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-boxcar.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-fbrake.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-fhub.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Parts took a while to arrive but it’s finally rolling. A week after I finished building it I put it to the test at <a href=\"http://theradavist.com/2021/06/the-2021-enve-builder-round-up-open-house-and-grodeo-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">Enve’s Grodeo</a> and didn’t have a single issue (with the bike, I was hurtin’ a bit.) I may have been the only rider in flats and running shoes which I secretly liked. And last weekend I bolted on my racks and took it on its first overnighter out in the Uintas with some of the guys from Cranky’s (seriously it’s a cool shop with cool people so check them out if you’re in Salt Lake.) </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/yall-city-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>While I wait for more adventures I’ll continue to enjoy taking it out for night rides on dirt roads and cruisey singletrack, after the heat of the day fades and the other riders head home.</p>\n<p><strong>Build specs:</strong><br />\nHeadset and spacers: White Industries<br />\nBB: White Industries<br />\nRear hub: White Industries XMR<br />\nFront hub: SON 28<br />\nRims: WTB KOM Tough<br />\nTires: Teravail Sparwood 27.5 x 2.1<br />\nChainring: Shimano XT 32T<br />\nCassette: Shimano SLX 10-51<br />\nRear derailleur: Shimano SLX 12 speed<br />\nShifter: Shimano XT 12 speed<br />\nCranks: Shimano Deore XT<br />\nPedals: Blue Lug Shark<br />\nBrakes: Paul Klamper flat mount<br />\nLevers: Paul Canti Levers<br />\nStem: Paul Boxcar<br />\nPost: Paul Tall &amp; Handsome<br />\nSeat clamp: Wolf Tooth<br />\nBars: Crust Juan Martin<br />\nGrips: Ergon GC1<br />\nSaddle: Brooks Flyer<br />\nHeadlight: SON Edelux II<br />\nHandlebar bag: Snēk<br />\nBottles: Radavist!<br />\nY’All-City decals: Southern Wonders</p>\n<p>When in touring mode:<br />\nFront rack: Pass And Stowe 5 Rail<br />\nRear rack: Tumbleweed Mini Pannier Rack</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"2cab89643a02192ed7d9c107f747e3ecc7c085f9219e1f2c27ce1e89af7c8143","category":"Cycling"}
