The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Plus took a 9% share of all iPhones sold, while the ‌iPhone 15‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> were the third most popular, each taking 14% of the share. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max share hardly changed compared to the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro and Pro Max the same quarter a year ago. However, Apple saw sales of the base model ‌iPhone 15‌ decline relative to a year ago. The overall mix of ‌iPhone 15‌ models was lower, accounting for 68% of all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> sales. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBy contrast, in Q1 2023 the ‌iPhone 14‌ series had a 7% higher share of all iPhones sold, taking 75% combined. The percentages suggest that the ‌iPhone 14‌ and ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus were more popular than the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus over the equivalent quarter the previous year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CIRP-iphone-14-15-quarters-compared.jpg\" width=\"1127\" height=\"827\" />\r<br />\nNoting the change, CIRP comments:\r<br />\n<blockquote>We see this as a continuation of a trend from the past couple of quarters, as the lower- priced current models give up some share to older models. The once flagship, now base iPhone 15, is no longer the leading-edge choice, as the Pro and Pro Max models take that role.</blockquote>Last week, CIRP released a report indicating that new ‌iPhone‌ activations are down to a low not seen in the U.S. smartphone market <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/iphone-activation-market-share-decline/\">for the last six years</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCIRP said that Apple's installed smartphone base was higher than recorded activations, but Apple's share of new ‌iPhone‌ activations fell from 40% to 33% over the past year, suggesting a shift away from the higher market shares Apple enjoyed in previous years.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/\">CIRP</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/cirp-iphone-15-vs-14-sales-q1/\">iPhone 15 and 15 Plus Proving Less Popular With Buyers This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-15-plus-proving-less-popular-with-buyers-this-year.2425315/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a0606741fedaa4e1d978e14d6eee4222a917d7e7c6ac1db193ae4728833327e7","category":"Apple"}
