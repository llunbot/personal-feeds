Sure, the latest and greatest carbon wunderbike is something we always lust over. But it is undeniable that the most effective – and usually most affordable – way to make your current mountain bike faster is to upgrade your rubber. And the tire companies are not sitting on their hands. In the first day of Czech racing on the popular Nové Město na Moravě course, we’ve already spotted at least 5 different tires sporting prototype labels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, at a time when mixed-surface tread tires are getting wider and wider, we’ve even seen dozens of riders racing and winning the short track XCC  even on gravel tires!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>XC World Cup Nove Mesto fast cross-country tire development </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight.webp\" alt=\"airtime for the Test Pilot crew\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-tire-Test-Pilot-in-flight-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With dry and hardpack conditions prevailing, the ruling factor in tire choice was ‘anything fast’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On day 1 of Czech World Cup racing, we’ve spotted new tires in development from Maxxis, Michelin, Pirelli &amp; Schwalbe.

Not for resale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maxxis’ Test Pilot program is probably the one we’ve seen most in XCO &amp; XCC racing, primarily because of this one tread pattern – the Aspen ST. For years, the Aspen ST was the quintessential pro-only XC tire. But <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-maxxis-aspen-st-team-spec/\" target=\"_blank\">since last spring</a>, you can actually buy this tire, too! It has been ridden to numerous dry World Cup cross-country wins, and is still sought after in the pro ranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this another evolution – maybe a new casing or new rubber compound? Or is it just that there are so many pros who’ve been relying on this tire for years, that there are still tons of Test Pilot-adorned Aspen STs floating around in the paddock?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen.webp\" alt=\"Maxxis Aspen Test Pilot, XCC World Cup Nove Mesto prototype fast cross-country tire development and race testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XCC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-race-testing_Maxxis-Test-Pilot-Aspen-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And don’t forget the original Maxxis Aspen, either. This is the XC race tire that pushed lightweight cross-country rubber to the seemingly giant 2.4″ widths that we see dominating today. We’ve heard (bike) rumors of XC pros asking for 2.6″ tires and even (<em>gasp!</em>) 32″ tires. But we’ve yet to see either of those materialize on the race circuit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did, however, catch wind of a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/32-mtb-tires-maxxis-aspen-prototype-taipei-show/\">32″ Maxxis Aspen</a> in Taipei earlier this spring.

It is dry and super hardpacked here. So, especially for today’s short track racing, the word of the day was ‘fast-rolling’. And what is faster-rolling than gravel tires?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of top XC racers swapped actual gravel tires into the XC bikes for the XCC racing. That’s not a big surprise, when the latest gravel tires often come in 45mm (1.7″), 50mm (1.97″) &amp; 55mm (2.17″) widths. I mean, even Pirelli’s latest road slicks <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pirelli-cinturato-evo-is-an-endurance-all-road-tire-with-eco-construction-up-to-55mm-wide/\" target=\"_blank\">come in 55mm!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spotted XCC World Champ Evie Richards racing Pirelli Cinturato Gravel RC tires and Chiara Teocchi on a Michelin Power Gravel rear tire (<em>both above</em>), while Christopher Blevins won and XCC World Champ Victor Koretzky (<em>below</em>) took second on Specialized Terra gravel tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Will Fast-Rolling XCC Tires Suit Sunday’s XCO Racing?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires.webp\" alt=\"racing on hardpack dirt, XCC World Cup Nove Mesto prototype fast cross-country tire development and race testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_Victor-Koretzky-racing-XCC-on-Specialized-Terra-gravel-tires-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The short track XCC Nové Město course isn’t really technical, though. It could be described as a crit on an even mix of asphalt, fine gravel, hardpack dirt, and grass. Sure, there are a lot of small jumps with some new hard landings, especially if you come up short (we did hear a lot of rear wheels get cased and even saw one frame broken in half at the chainstay). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass.webp\" alt=\"racing on grass, XCC World Cup Nove Mesto prototype fast cross-country tire development and race testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XC-World-Cup-Nove-Mesto-prototype-fast-cross-country-tire-development-and-race-testing_JofreCullell-Estape-racing-Test-Pilot-Aspens-on-grass-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the loose dirt, big rock gardens, and slick roots are saved for the longer XCO race Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will we see such fast-rolling tires on Sunday’s racecourse? Will any gravel tires show up on the start line? We suspect not, but who knows? But, I’m sure we’ll see plenty of those Test Pilot Maxxis Aspens and Aspen STs!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prototype-first-ride-work-in-progress-test-pilot-even-gravel-tires-race-xc-world-cup/\">Prototype, First Ride, Work In Progress, Test Pilot &amp; Even Gravel Tires Race XC World Cup</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"faff8fa431597e1b4d70bfb76aea30e230b010350dd340f94d80eefd9fdd452d","category":"Cycling"}
