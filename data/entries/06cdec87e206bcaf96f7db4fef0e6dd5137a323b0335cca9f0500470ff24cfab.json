Apple has yet to release any iPhones without a SIM card tray outside of the U.S., but it sounds like the change will finally expand internationally starting with the iPhone 17 lineup next September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIndeed, the report said that all current \"iPhone 17 Air\" prototypes lack a SIM card tray. The report said it is unclear if the device will be sold in China as a result, since the country has not approved the use of eSIMs in smartphones. Of course, that could change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the iPhone 14 series launched in 2022, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/14/apple-promotes-esim-benefits-for-iphone/\">promoted eSIMs as being more secure</a> than a physical SIM, as they cannot be removed from an iPhone that is lost or stolen. In addition, at least eight eSIMs can be managed on an iPhone at once, eliminating the need to obtain, carry, and swap physical SIM cards while traveling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/101569\">support document</a> with a list of carriers around that world that support eSIMs.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-esim-only-in-more-countries-report/\">Apple Reportedly Plans to Remove iPhone's SIM Card Tray in More Countries Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-plans-to-remove-iphones-sim-card-tray-in-more-countries-next-year.2443968/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"06cdec87e206bcaf96f7db4fef0e6dd5137a323b0335cca9f0500470ff24cfab","category":"Apple"}
