We often forget she\nworked for most of her career for him, and this is also how he\nwanted the communications around Apple to be. Cotton was in close\ncollaboration with Jobs who, more than most CEOs, had strong ideas\nabout press relations and also direct lines to reporters.</p>\n\n<p>This was sometimes a double-edged sword, because she worked\nfor a tech legend who wanted exactly what he wanted when it\ncame to media. But it was clear that both saw the press as\nextremely important, although largely for the opportunity to\nrepeat and validate what they were saying. Neither suffered\nfools, and neither had much use for those with tough criticism\nor opposing views.</p>\n\n<p>But it worked and brilliantly, as Apple has become pretty much the\nmost successful brand on the planet under her tenure. Amazing\nlaunches, incredibly tightly held and presenting Apple in the best\npossible way.</p>\n\n<p>Not impressed anyway with Cotton’s work? Still all\nfoot-stomping pissed off because you did not get any PR love\nfrom her? <em>Grow up.</em></p>\n\n<p>Whether I agreed with her or not over the years, I always\nrespected that Cotton was a person who did it her way. And,\njudging from Apple’s success, there is no way you can separate her\nwork from contributing in a significant way over the years. That\nsome say the products have shined in spite of her is a canard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/10/swisher-on-cotton\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9b0413bb59e6d6eeb689ac3d2abfcf753746287feca445760bc2b0660185ab1c","category":"Tech"}
