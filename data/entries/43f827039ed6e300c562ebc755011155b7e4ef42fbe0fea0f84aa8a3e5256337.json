But the decision is in direct conflict with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which says it \"stands by its decision\" to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/uk-government-blocks-microsofts-proposed-activision-purchase/\">block the deal</a> in that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/uk-article-50-brexit-trigger/\">Brexit-separated country</a>.</p>\n<h2>Microsoft will fix it</h2>\n<p>Months ago, the EC's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/microsofts-activision-deal-faces-in-depth-probes-in-brussels-and-london/\">preliminary investigation</a> of the Microsoft/Activision deal concluded that the proposed merger could reduce competition in areas including cloud gaming services and PC operating systems. And despite the EC's final decision, today's <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2705\">final report</a> on the matter affirms some of those preliminary competition concerns.</p>\n<p>\"If Microsoft made Activision's games exclusive to its own cloud game streaming service, Game Pass Ultimate, and withheld them from rival cloud game streaming providers, it would reduce competition in the distribution of games via cloud game streaming,\" the EC concluded. Such a move could \"also strengthen the position of Windows in the market for PC operating systems,\" the European regulators wrote.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939342#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939342&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"43f827039ed6e300c562ebc755011155b7e4ef42fbe0fea0f84aa8a3e5256337","category":"Tech"}
