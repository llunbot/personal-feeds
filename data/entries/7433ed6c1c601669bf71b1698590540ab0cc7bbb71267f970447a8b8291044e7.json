On the other hand, \"Titanium Gray\" will apparently be similar to the shade of Space Gray offered on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> in 2014.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium, and Natural Titanium. It is worth noting that there is no ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ with a Gold finish. Gold was available through 2013's ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>‌ 5S to 2017's ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 8, and then on 2018's ‌‌iPhone‌‌ XS to 2022's ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ Pro. The reintroduction of a gold-like shade with the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ seems very plausible as a result.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-color-options/\">iPhone 15 Pro Color Options: Which Should You Choose?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's \"Pro\" ‌iPhone‌ models have always been available in no more than four color options at launch, usually with basic black, white, and gold options alongside a more striking color like green, blue, or purple. This means that while Black Titanium and White Titanium are highly likely to be carried over from the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ to the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌, the continuation of Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium is far from certain. It is possible that these color options may be discontinued to make way for \"Desert Titanium\" and \"Titanium Gray,\" especially since \"Titanium Gray\" appears to be very similar to Natural Titanium.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the first rumor about the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌'s color options and Majin Bu has a mixed track record for revealing accurate information about Apple's plans. Nevertheless, more information is likely to emerge in the coming months as we approach launch.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/\">iPhone 16 Pro Could Come in Two New Color Options</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-could-come-in-two-new-color-options.2419853/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7433ed6c1c601669bf71b1698590540ab0cc7bbb71267f970447a8b8291044e7","category":"Apple"}
