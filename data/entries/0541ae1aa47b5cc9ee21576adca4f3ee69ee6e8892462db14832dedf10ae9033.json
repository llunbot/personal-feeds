With <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">an incredibly difficult route</a> that including monstrous climbs of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-tour-de-france-climbs-col-du-tourmalet\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Tourmalet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-alto-de-l-angliru\" target=\"_blank\">Alto de l’Angliru</a>, there’ll be plenty to separate the main contenders early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only that, but the start list is completely stacked with riders who could challenge for the overall winner’s red jersey, the only notable absence being <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, who’s taking the time to rest before undoubtedly sweeping the Italian classics for a third time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that does mean that two-time Tour de France winner <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a> is attempting to become the first man since <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/chris-froome\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Froome</a> to do the Tour-Vuelta double and he’ll be joined on the Jumbo-Visma team by three-time Vuelta winner <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a>, who’s attempting to be the first man to do the Giro-Vuelta double since <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/alberto-contador\" target=\"_blank\">Alberto Contador</a>. However, will they have equal backing? Only time will tell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The riders hoping to prevent Jumbo-Visma from becoming the first team ever to win all three men’s Grand Tours in a single season include defending champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> of Soudal-QuickStep, Tadej Pogačar’s UAE Team Emirates teammate and Spain’s own super-talent Juan Ayuso,

pressure on Jonas Vingegaard then. The Dane hasn’t raced since the Tour de France, avoiding the World Championships to keep his shape for the Vuelta. There <em>will </em>be less pressure on him than in France because of Jumbo-Visma’s two-leader approach, but Vingegaard will be expected to play a big part in securing the Grand Tour Grand Slam. If he’s even near to his Tour de France form no one will come close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rating: </strong>4.5/5</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Primož Roglič, Jumbo-Visma</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-970x641.jpg\" alt=\"man in red cycling jersey\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-970x641.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-300x198.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-768x508.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-750x496.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez-1140x754.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/roglic-vuelta-PHOTOGOMEZSPORT___Luis_Angel_Gomez.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Luis Angel Gomez ©PHOTOGOMEZSPORT2019 via Unipublic</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Vuelta himself Primož Roglič is back to try to win his fourth red jersey after Remco Evenepoel (with help from Fred Wright) usurped him last year. He left it late to win the Giro earlier in the year, looking pretty normal until the final mountain time-trial, but that win plus a very quiet summer – his only race since the Giro was the Vuelta a Burgos last week, which he won – should put him in good stead to come in hot. Unfortunately for him, Roglič’s biggest challenger is his teammate and it wouldn’t be surprising if he’s working for VIngegaard come the third week.

With Vingegaard joining Roglič in the race, this will be Evenepoel’s biggest Grand Tour test, if he comes out on top then he’ll be firmly on the cusp on joining Vingegaard and Pogačar in the top tier of contenders. However, with heightened pressure on his Soudal-QuickStep team to support his general classification ambitions and hardly the strongest line-up to assist him, questions will be asked if he’s left to fend for himself and loses.

He’s the next in line to the young super-talent throne that Evenepoel currently holds after Tadej Pogačar got old. The quality of the field here puts him in a tough position to improve on his 2022 result, however with his continuing development, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a proper breakthrough this time around.

The only races he’s done since is a roll-out at the Tour de Pologne and tenth in the World Championships time-trial, so who knows what kind of form he’s actually in. Thomas has only ridden the Vuelta once before, finishing 69th overall in 2015, when he was a mountain domestique and Classics rider, so this is new territory. Don’t expect a win, but don’t be surprised if he completes his set of Grand Tour podiums.
