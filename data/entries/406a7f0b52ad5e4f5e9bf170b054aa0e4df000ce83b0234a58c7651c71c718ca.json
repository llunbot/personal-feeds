The company's next landing attempt, using a much larger spacecraft, will include fixes to prevent a similar failure.</p>\n<p>Astrobotic's first Peregrine lander, which the company called Peregrine Mission One, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/americas-first-lunar-lander-in-a-half-century-wont-reach-the-moon/\">launched on January 8 aboard United Launch Alliance's first Vulcan rocket</a>. But soon after separating from the rocket in space, the lander ran into trouble as it stepped through an activation sequence to begin priming its propulsion system.</p>\n<p>A review board determined \"the most likely cause of the malfunction was a failure of a single helium pressure control valve called a PCV—pressure control valve 2, within the propulsion system,\" said John Horack, a space industry veteran and professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at Ohio State University.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045535#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045535&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"406a7f0b52ad5e4f5e9bf170b054aa0e4df000ce83b0234a58c7651c71c718ca","category":"Tech"}
