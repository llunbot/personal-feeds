But the Supreme Court won't take up the case. The high court denied the telecom groups' petition without comment in a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121624zor_6khn.pdf\">list of orders</a> released yesterday.</p>\n<p>Although a US District Court judge <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ny-cant-force-isps-to-offer-15-low-income-broadband-plans-judge-rules/\">blocked the law</a> in 2021, that judge's ruling was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/court-upholds-new-york-law-that-says-isps-must-offer-15-broadband/\">reversed</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in April 2024.
