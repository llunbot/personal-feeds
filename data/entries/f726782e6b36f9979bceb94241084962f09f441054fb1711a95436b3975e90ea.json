It's not an all-or-nothing process, either, as IBM claims that watsonx-generated code should be interoperable with COBOL and certain Z mainframe functions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962519#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962519&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f726782e6b36f9979bceb94241084962f09f441054fb1711a95436b3975e90ea","category":"Tech"}
