Earlier this year, Young gave a more vague 2025 release timeline, but now he has dialed his prediction in to the latter half of the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/apple-custom-displays-microled-apple-watch/\">confirmed Apple's work</a> on a microLED Apple Watch, and in January, he suggested that the device could come out at the end of 2024, but Apple's timeline has likely since shifted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarly rumors about devices that are a year or two out can be unreliable in terms of launch timing as Apple often has to push back its release dates due to delays in design, component sourcing, manufacturing, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ is expected to be the first Apple device to adopt a microLED display, but Apple is planning to bring the technology to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and other devices in the future.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/\">Apple Watch Ultra With MicroLED Display 'Pushed' to Second Half of 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-with-microled-display-pushed-to-second-half-of-2025.2387992/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ad0d1a09f0d9fbe550d56a1d07c92ecb4238da51c27b20704c9c504e0faa7c72","category":"Apple"}
