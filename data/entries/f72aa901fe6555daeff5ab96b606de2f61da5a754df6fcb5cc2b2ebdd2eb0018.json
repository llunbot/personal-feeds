{"title":"Intuit’s PR Team Has Seemingly Never Heard of the Streisand Effect","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273820/intuit-ceo-sasan-goodarzi-turbotax-irs-quickbooks-ai-software-decoder-interview","date":1729658978000,"content":"\n<p>Nilay Patel, after interviewing Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi for his Decoder podcast at The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s also not just lobbying: in 2022, a coalition of attorneys\ngeneral from all 50 states got Intuit to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23057463/intuit-141-million-agreement-new-york-attorney-general-turbotax-free\">agree to a $141 million\nsettlement</a> that required Intuit to refund low-income\nAmericans who were eligible for free filing but were redirected to\npaid products. In 2023, the FTC found that TurboTax’s “free”\nmarketing was willfully deceptive, and after the agency won an\nappeal early this year, Intuit was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24047807/turbotax-misleading-advertising-free-tax-file-ftc-final-order\">ordered to stop doing\nit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I asked about that, and Sasan disagreed with me, and we went back\nand forth for a few minutes on it. It’s Decoder; we have exchanges\nlike this all the time, and I didn’t think anything of it.</p>\n\n<p>But then I got a note from Rick Heineman, the chief communications\nofficer at Intuit, who called the line of questioning and my tone\n“inappropriate,” “egregious,” and “disappointing” and demanded\nthat we delete that entire section of the recording. I mean,\nliterally — he wrote a long email that ended with “at the very\nleast the end portion of your interview should be deleted.”</p>\n\n<p>We don’t do that here at The Verge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What’s bananas about this is that the contentious segment of the interview ... wasn’t really all that contentious? If not for this controversy generated entirely by Intuit’s own comms chief, I’d have listened to the episode and might not have even thought twice about the whole segment on Intuit’s lobbying against the IRS and tax code being updated to eliminate the need for complicated tax filing. Of course Patel was going to bring this up. It’d have been shocking if he hadn’t. And I think Sasan presented Intuit’s case about as well it can be presented.</p>\n\n<p>But now the episode has been the number one story at The Verge all day, and surely getting way more listens than the average Decoder episode — with listeners primed to pay attention to the segment on Intuit’s anti-tax-reform lobbying and the penalty they were fined for bilking low-income users into paid service they didn’t need.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect\">the Streisand effect</a> isn’t counterintuitive. It’s obvious human nature. We want to look at and listen to things we’re told not to look at or listen to.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/22/intuit-the-verge-streisand-effect\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f72aa901fe6555daeff5ab96b606de2f61da5a754df6fcb5cc2b2ebdd2eb0018","category":"Tech"}
