I hope you all enjoy the season of spring or fall with your family.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Last Week’s Launches</u></strong><br /> Like an April Fool’s Day joke, there were 65 launches last week, far more than usual. AWS product teams are working hard with a customer obsession.</p> \n<p>So, I had a lot of trouble choosing the important ones. Other than the ones I’ve picked out, there may be important feature releases that fit your needs. Be sure to take a look at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">full launches list</a> in the last week.</p> \n<p>First, here is a list of the general availability of AWS services and features treated by AWS News Blog:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-service-to-service-connectivity-security-and-monitoring-with-amazon-vpc-lattice-now-generally-available/\">Amazon VPC Lattice Simplifies Service-to-Service Connectivity, Security, and Monitoring</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ready-to-use-models-and-support-for-custom-text-and-image-classification-models-in-amazon-sagemaker-canvas/\">Amazon SageMaker Canvas Supports Custom Text and Image Classification Models</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-guardduty-now-supports-amazon-eks-runtime-monitoring/\">Amazon GuardDuty Now Supports Amazon EKS Runtime Monitoring</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-general-availability-of-step-by-step-guides-for-amazon-connect-agent-workspace/\">Amazon Connect Agent Workspace Step-by-Step Guides</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-application-migration-service-major-updates-import-and-export-feature-source-server-migration-metrics-dashboard-and-additional-post-launch-actions/\">AWS Application Migration Service Major Updates: Import and Export Feature, Source Server Migration Metrics Dashboard, and Additional Post-Launch Actions</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-call-analytics-real-time-voice-tone-analysis-and-speaker-search/\">Amazon Chime SDK Call Analytics: Real-Time Voice Tone Analysis and Speaker Search</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let’s take a look at some launches from the last week that I want to remind you of:</p> \n<p><strong>The Preview of Amazon DataZone</strong> – At AWS re:Invent 2022, we preannounced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datazone/\">Amazon DataZone</a>, a new data management service to catalog, discover, analyze, share, and govern data between data producers and consumers in the organization.
