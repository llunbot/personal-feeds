All three are consistent with the idea that\nabout one in 5,000 vaccinated Americans have tested positive for\nCovid each day in recent weeks.</p>\n\n<p>The chances are surely higher in the places with the worst Covid\noutbreaks, like the Southeast. And in places with many fewer\ncases — like the Northeast, as well as the Chicago, Los Angeles\nand San Francisco areas — the chances are lower, probably less\nthan 1 in 10,000. That’s what the Seattle data shows, for\nexample. (These numbers don’t include undiagnosed cases, which\nare often so mild that people do not notice them and do not pass\nthe virus to anyone else.)</p>\n\n<p>Here’s one way to think about a one-in-10,000 daily chance: It\nwould take more than three months for the combined risk to reach\njust 1 percent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Breakthrough cases for the vaccinated are <em>far</em> more rare than many people have been led to believe through clickbait headlines.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/07/covid-breakthrough-cases\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2012ac45f15150ccec437e5b8b82e96302f3a7ecc7857b88f594567acb19c71c","category":"Tech"}
