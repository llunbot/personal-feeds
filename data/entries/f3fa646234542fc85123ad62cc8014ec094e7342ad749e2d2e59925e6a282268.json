At least as far as \nApple’s video content is concerned, the iTunes brand is on the \nway out. </p>\n\n<p>Apple has updated the TV app in 17.2 in preparation of the \nmigration away from the standalone iTunes videos app, bringing \nacross some functionality that was previously missing in TV. That \nincludes things like filtering by genre in purchased tab, and the \ninclusion of box sets in the store listings. The TV app also \nfeatures a new sidebar design in this update, which includes a \ndedicated store and purchases tab for quick navigation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s the updates to the TV app that make this possible. It’s a good simplification overall: Apple’s own content — both iTunes purchases and TV+ streaming content — is in the TV app.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/06/itunes-movies-tvos-17\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f3fa646234542fc85123ad62cc8014ec094e7342ad749e2d2e59925e6a282268","category":"Tech"}
