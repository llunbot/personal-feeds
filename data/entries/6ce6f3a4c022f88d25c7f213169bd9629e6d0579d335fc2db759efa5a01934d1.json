Test results for TSMC's \"N2\" 2nm prototype chips have already been showcased to Apple and several other key TSMC clients as plans for upcoming chips begin to solidify.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a separate report, <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231211PD229.html\"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> points out that Apple is a key player in TSMC's battle against Samsung and Intel to bring 2nm chips to market, with no sign of the close relationship between the two companies waning. Apple reportedly has no plans to reduce its ‌3nm‌ or 2nm chip orders from TSMC before 2027 at the earliest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple was the first company to utilize TSMC's ‌3nm‌ technology with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's N2 chips. TSMC's production of 2nm chips is slated to begin in 2025, with their first appearance in Apple devices likely to follow soon after.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/\">Financial Times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/\">TSMC Demos Next-Gen Chip Technology to Apple Ahead of 2025 Debut</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology-to-apple-ahead-of-2025-debut.2413498/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ce6f3a4c022f88d25c7f213169bd9629e6d0579d335fc2db759efa5a01934d1","category":"Apple"}
