Kuo and Gurman are thus in agreement that a new AirTag is not coming until next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Features</h2>\r<br />\nGurman previously said the new AirTag would feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/airtag-with-new-chip-due-next-year/\">upgraded chip with improved location tracking</a>. If so, the AirTag could be updated with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in all iPhone 15 models last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo believes the new AirTag will have some kind of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/\">integration with Apple's Vision Pro headset</a>, but he has not shared any specific details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo design changes have been rumored for the AirTag so far.
