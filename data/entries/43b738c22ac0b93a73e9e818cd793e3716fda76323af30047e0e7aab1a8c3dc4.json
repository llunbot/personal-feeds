However, insider sources recently revealed <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-12/musk-s-x-2023-ad-sales-projected-to-slump-to-about-2-5-billion\">to Bloomberg</a> that the social media platform expects to end 2023 with \"roughly\" $2.5 billion in advertising revenue.</p>\n<p>That's \"a significant slump from prior years,\" sources said. It's also about half a billion short of the $3 billion that X executives expected to make in ad sales in 2023, one source said.</p>\n<p>Last year, Twitter raked in more than $1 billion in ad revenue per quarter, sources said. But in each of the first three quarters of 2023, X only managed to generate \"a little more than $600 million\" in ad revenue.
