It felt like we were gearing up for a snow day. However, what unfolded Friday morning was something Western North Carolina had never experienced. Tucked into the Blue Ridge Mountains and 300+ miles from the coast, Asheville, often called a “Climate Haven,” had always been considered safe from natural disasters. But Hurricane Helene brought devastation that no one could have imagined—rains, winds, and destruction that changed our community forever.</p>\n<p>The storm left incomprehensible damage in its wake—homes, businesses, ecosystems, and lives were impacted in ways that will take years, if ever, to rebuild. For 48 hours, we experienced a total communication blackout with no power or cell service. When we were finally able to reconnect, the news got worse before it got better. The destruction across Western North Carolina was immense, and many communities and landscapes will never fully recover.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, all of our Industry Nine staff have been accounted for and are safe. Our immediate focus has been on ensuring that our employees and their families have access to the basic necessities: food, water, and shelter. After ten days, power is slowly being restored to some areas, though Asheville remains without water, and there is no clear timeline for its return. The damage to the city’s water system has been described as catastrophic.<br />\nOn Monday, October 7, many of our employees returned to work. It was an emotional day, marked by uncertainty. How would we feel about returning to work after facing such devastation? With so many unanswered questions, the path forward seemed unclear.</p>\n<p>The response from our staff and community has been nothing short of extraordinary. Since the disaster hit, i9 staff have volunteered 1,000+ hours to support our WNC community. Neighbors bringing food and water to neighbors. Long hours with chainsaws clearing roads to reconnect isolated communities. Volunteer-led search and rescue missions in rural Appalachia. Staff members conducting wellness checks, delivering supplies, and carrying buckets of water up stairs for elderly residents to flush toilets. Driving across state lines to bring back essential food, water, and supplies.</p>\n<p>In times of heartbreak, it can be difficult to know the best way to help. We encourage you to donate to local grassroots organizations ingrained within the community. Find those who know the area’s needs intimately, and support their efforts—whether through donations, volunteer hours, or simply by acknowledging the hard work being done to recover and rebuild.</p>\n<p>That said, we at Industry Nine also need your support. We’ve committed to paying all of our employees full wages throughout this crisis. While we have resumed normal business operations in a limited capacity, we are also continuing to pay some employees who are volunteering within the community. Our warehouse has become a distribution center in partnership with PODER Emma, delivering critical resources to those in need. Forklift loads are alternating between pallets of potable water and custom wheel builds. I9 employees are rotating between coordinating community supply runs and entering hub orders.</p>\n<p>Continuing to pay our employees was an easy decision, but it comes with significant financial challenges. We can only do this if we continue to sell our products.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been considering purchasing Industry Nine products, now is the time we need your support the most. There are countless businesses in Western North Carolina that make this area so special and unique. For us, our specialty is hand-building custom cycling componentry. To further support our community, we are donating 10% of all retail sales from October 8th through the 31st, split between PODER Emma, Brother Wolf, and MANNA Asheville to help amplify their efforts.</p>\n<p>Manufacturing high-quality bicycle components in Asheville, NC, and paying our employees a livable wage has always been a challenge. But the road ahead is likely our greatest challenge yet. We thank you deeply for your continued support.</p>\n<p>With love and gratitude,<br />\nThe i9 Team</p>\n<p>​Donate directly below to the organizations we are supporting:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.poderemma.org/home?_kx=iPM-GO6XXPUjs_p7pMGZumQlXKXCcLoUgp0xreHEqG0.QrfpvQ\" target=\"_blank\">PODER Emma</a></strong><br />\nDelivering essential and critical supplies to 3,000+ people a day through grassroots community organization.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bwar.org/?_kx=iPM-GO6XXPUjs_p7pMGZumQlXKXCcLoUgp0xreHEqG0.QrfpvQ\" target=\"_blank\">Brother Wolf Animal Rescue</a></strong><br />\nAnimal shelter located on the Swannanoa River that was flooded by Helene and is now rebuilding to continue their mission of promoting animal adoption, foster programs, and low cost mobile spay/neuter clinics.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.mannafoodbank.org/?_kx=iPM-GO6XXPUjs_p7pMGZumQlXKXCcLoUgp0xreHEqG0.QrfpvQ\" target=\"_blank\">MANNA Asheville</a></strong><br />\nNot-for-profit Asheville based organization devastated by flooding that is working to end food insecurity in WNC.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://industrynine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Industry Nine</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/industry-nine-is-donating-10-of-sales-to-hurricane-helene-relief/\">Industry Nine is Donating 10% of Sales to Hurricane Helene Relief</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"38f0e66a83cb705fe055d24cfaab4f34ae81c504aa1718f2d57e7c3a64144a5a","category":"Cycling"}
