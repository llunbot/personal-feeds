The studio included industry veterans that worked on titles like Halo, Overwatch, and God of War.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/netflix-games-launch.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThere have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/netflix-games-ios-launch/\">mobile gaming titles</a> available through Netflix since 2021, but Team Blue was supposedly working on a big budget AAA gaming title that would have represented an expansion of Netflix's gaming efforts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe decision to shutter the studio developing an original multi-platform AAA title suggests that gaming might not be going so well for Netflix. Back in 2022, a report suggested that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/08/netflix-games-note-engaging-subscribers/\">less than one percent</a> of Netflix subscribers were engaging in games, but Netflix has made an effort to introduce more premium titles since then.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix's mobile gaming catalog includes several Grand Theft Auto titles, popular roguelike Hades, Cozy Grove, Farming Simulator, Spiritfarer, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and more. The games are included with a Netflix subscription, and no additional fees are required to play them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix games can be downloaded as standalone games on Apple devices, and are available to play after logging in with an active Netflix account.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/22/netflix-game-studio-shutdown/\">Game Studio Shutdown Suggests Gaming May Not Be Working Out for Netflix</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/game-studio-shutdown-suggests-gaming-may-not-be-working-out-for-netflix.2440744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a86ac1d1e306aaa41a6fc3bfbdf39346f9e69475d0adff52659419b729fdb2ae","category":"Apple"}
