Apple says that researchers have helped it to implement \"novel mitigations\" for protecting iOS devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOver the course of the last six months, program participants have received 37 CVE credits for their findings, and have contributed to improvements for the XNU kernel, kernel extensions, and XPC services.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nResearchers who participate in the SRDP are eligible for <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/bounty\">Apple Security Bounty payouts</a>. Apple has rewarded more than 100 reports from SRDP researches, and says that \"multiple awards\" have reached $500,000 with a median award of close to $18,000.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> research devices that Apple provides to participants feature special hardware and software designed for security research. Researchers are able to configure or disable the iOS security protections to manipulate them in ways not possible with a standard ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSRDs are available to security researchers who have a track record in security research both on the ‌iPhone‌ and other platforms, plus Apple is making devices available to university educators who want to use it as a teaching tool for computer science students.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple selects a limited number of participants each year to receive a research device, and <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/research-device\">applications are open</a> until October 31, 2023. Selected participants will be notified in early 2024.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-security-research-device-program-2024/\">Apple Invites Researchers to Apply for Special iPhone Designed for Finding Vulnerabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-invites-researchers-to-apply-for-special-iphone-designed-for-finding-vulnerabilities.2400054/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f66efa9cced04a6ceba355b56abf033cfc73af756511a3507c0043e378010d9d","category":"Apple"}
