Our 3 <em>NEW</em> MOD Components. (Moots. Own. Design.) A newly designed stem, bar and fork that work as one to bring integration to our top gravel racer. <span></span> For several years we have designed our own gravel and road forks to go along with our frames. Before those times we relied on other brands for our forks and found were often at the mercy of supply chain and spec offering. We decided to take matters into our own hands to make sure we always had forks to go along with our frames. The correct offsets, a graphic that was pure Moots, and a ride quality that matched our frames. They had to be our design and our own molds that we owned outright. That line of forks has been successful by all accounts.</p>\n<p>Most recently we have branched out by going through the same process, but apply that to a stem, handlebar and a new fork. As times have changed, integration has entered the picture of handbuilt bicycles and lead us down the path for what you see in these images. A stem that works seamlessly with a new gravel bar and a new take on our trusted gravel fork with full internal routing. Let’s take a closer look at each of these components.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0061-copy-1024x683.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0061-copy-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0061-copy-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0061-copy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0061-copy-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0061-copy.jpeg 1920w\" /><strong>STEM</strong></p>\n<p>We worked closely with Chris King Precision Components to develop the ACR top cap that is used by other component makers to ensure wide compatibility. A 35mm bar to stem diameter helps to route brake hoses and electronic wires internally by giving a bit more wiggle room vs. a 31.8.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>70mm – 120mm in 10mm increments</span></li>\n<li><span>-3 degrees only</span></li>\n<li><span>35mm bar clamp diameter</span></li>\n<li><span>ACR internal interface, used by other component manufacturers for wide compatibility</span></li>\n<li><span>Made-to-match carbon top cap</span></li>\n<li><span>200g for 90mm stem with faceplates, and hardware</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0142-copy-1024x674.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"527\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0142-copy-1024x674.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0142-copy-300x197.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0142-copy-768x506.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0142-copy-1536x1011.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0142-copy.jpeg 1917w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>HANDLEBAR</strong></p>\n<p>A gravel bar was our first choice when it came to a bar.
