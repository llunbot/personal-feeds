Google LLC, case number 6:21-cv-00569 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas).</p>\n<p>The ruling comes after Touchstream filed a complaint in June 2021 claiming that it met with Google in December 2011 and was told that the tech giant wasn't interested in partnering with it in February 2012. Google then released Chromecast in 2013. The complaint points to the first Chromecast and the second and third generations, Chromecast Ultra and Chromecast with Google TV, as well as other Chromecast-integrated products, as infringements of Touchstream patents.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956208#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956208&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a34879d08e95383d3df755605da66cc19ce74fb9b313a7c22799be7b8d8f3277","category":"Tech"}
