Apple announced in June of 2020 its two-year-long transition to Apple silicon for the Mac, and despite Intel's best hopes and dreams, Apple is continuing its momentum to break up with it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNow, a <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20211020PD208.html\">new report</a> from <em>DigiTimes</em> is further indicating Intel is still trying to win back Apple as a customer. According to the report, Intel, alongside Samsung, is \"striving to win orders for Apple's in-house developed Mac processors.\" Such a move from Apple would mean the company no longer relies entirely on TSMC for the production of its Mac processors, a decision that sources quoted in the report say is unlikely.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIntel's actions and comments publicly and seemingly behind closed doors could not be further apart. While Intel's CEO publicly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/24/intel-ceo-apple-competitive-fun/\">expressed his wish</a> to have Apple back as a customer, the company continues to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/31/intel-claims-pcs-offer-better-gaming-than-macs/\">run anti-Mac marketing campaigns</a> targeted towards Apple and the Mac. Oddly enough, these campaigns, which have ranged from \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/intel-social-experiment-pc-vs-mac-ad/\">social experiments</a>\" to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/intel-tweet-for-mac-users-backfires/\">tweets that backfired</a>, all occur as Intel and Apple still work together to an extent. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple no longer has an Intel processor in its entire MacBook (Air and Pro) lineup. Apple still has the larger 27-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>, and a high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> running with Intel processors. All of which are expected to be updated next year, with the latter happening sooner rather than later. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn Intel spokesperson declined to respond to our email asking for a comment about the ‌M1‌ Pro, ‌M1‌ Max, and Apple dropping even more Intel-powered Macs from its lineup. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/m1-pro-m1-max-gains-intel-apple-business/\">Despite M1 Pro and M1 Max Performance and Efficiency Gains, Intel Still Hopes Apple Will Do Business With It</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/despite-m1-pro-and-m1-max-performance-and-efficiency-gains-intel-still-hopes-apple-will-do-business-with-it.2318155/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LmiQoxVykr8:lv_pxO40iuk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LmiQoxVykr8:lv_pxO40iuk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LmiQoxVykr8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"11f1525221ed7906ab9e8ad493719196705a3ccc91c12035aed78445b1c41752","category":"Apple"}
