Sure, we’ve all learned by now that aero is everything, and road tubeless offers the lowest rolling-resistance. But when you are just time trialing uphill, lightweight is king. And in this case, it’s hard to argue with the allure of a 963g disc brake road wheelset that weighs as little as 963g complete…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hunt Hill Climb SL Disc carbon tubular road bike wheelset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing.jpg\" alt=\"Hunt Hill Climb SL Disc ultralight carbon tubular road bike wheelset, Andrew Feather climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hunt-Hill-Climb-SL-Disc-ultralight-carbon-tubular-road-bike-wheelset_Andrew-Feather-climbing-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.
