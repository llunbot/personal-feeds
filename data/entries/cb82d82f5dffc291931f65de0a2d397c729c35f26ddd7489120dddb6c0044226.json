High Power Mode is not available on other models.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Like the Pro Display XDR, the new MacBook Pro displays have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/new-16-inch-macbook-pro-brighter-display/\">peak brightness of 500 nits for standard aka SDR content</a>, according to Apple. The new MacBook Pro's advertised 1,600 nits of peak full-screen brightness is for HDR content only.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>In regards to Face ID, Apple said customers love the experience of using Touch ID on the Mac for everything from unlocking their Mac, to filling in passwords online, changing accounts, and making secure purchases with Apple Pay, but the company unsurprisingly said it has nothing to announce about its plans for Face ID on Mac.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>The SD card reader in the new MacBook Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-reader-speed/\">supports up to 250MB/s of data transfer</a> with the latest UHS-II SD cards and up to 90MB/s with UHS-I SD cards, according to Apple.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Like other Macs with Apple silicon, the new MacBook Pro models still do not support external GPUs (eGPUs).
