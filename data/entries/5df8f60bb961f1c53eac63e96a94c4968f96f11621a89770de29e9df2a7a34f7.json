CarPlay Ultra builds on the\ncapabilities of CarPlay and provides the ultimate in-car\nexperience by deeply integrating with the vehicle to deliver the\nbest of iPhone and the best of the car. It provides information\nfor all of the driver’s screens, including real-time content and\ngauges in the instrument cluster, while reflecting the automaker’s\nlook and feel and offering drivers a customizable experience. Many\nother automakers around the world are working to bring CarPlay\nUltra to drivers, including newly committed brands Hyundai, Kia,\nand Genesis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156741/ios-16-carplay-apple-wwdc-hvac-deeper-integration\">First announced at WWDC 2022</a>, simply as “the next generation of CarPlay”, it was originally set to ship “<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/29/next-generation-carplay-still-yet-to-launch/\">before the end of 2024</a>”. So it’s a little late, but by the standards of the auto industry, not <em>too</em> late. It looks really good — Apple’s Newsroom article is replete with photos and videos showing it in action. It feels true to both Apple’s and Aston Martin’s brand identities — but I’d say more Apple-y than Aston Martin-y, simply because the typography is all San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p>Apple successfully held the name “CarPlay Ultra” secret until today. (Would have been funny, given <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/14/hbo-max-again\">other news this week</a>, if they’d called it “CarPlay Max”.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/15/carplay-ultra-aston-martin\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5df8f60bb961f1c53eac63e96a94c4968f96f11621a89770de29e9df2a7a34f7","category":"Tech"}
