{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup – CodeWhisperer, CodeCatalyst, RDS, Route53, and more – October 24, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-codewhisperer-codecatalyst-rds-route53-and-more-october-23-2023/","date":1698168954000,"content":"<p>The entire AWS News Blog team is fully focused on writing posts to announce the new services and features during our annual customer conference in Las Vegas, <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/\">AWS re:Invent</a>! And while we prepare content for you to read, our services teams continue to innovate. Here is my summary of last week’s launches.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some of the launches that captured my attention:</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon CodeCatalyst</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-codecatalyst-scheduled-workflow-triggers/\">You can now add a cron expression to trigger a CI/CD workflow</a>, providing a way to start workflows at set times. CodeCatalyst is a unified development service that integrates a project’s collaboration tools, CI/CD pipelines, and development and deployment environments.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Route53</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-route-53-traffic-flow-geoproximity-routing-local-zones/\">You can now route your customer’s traffic to their closest AWS Local Zones</a> to improve application performance for latency-sensitive workloads. Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-geoproximity.html\">geoproximity routing</a> in the Route53 documentation.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> – The root certificates we use to sign your databases’ TLS certificates will expire in 2024. You must generate new certificates for your databases before the expiration date. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\">This blog post details the procedure step by step</a>. The new root certificates we generated are valid for the next 40 years for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-2048\">RSA2048</a> and 100 years for the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\">RSA4098 and ECC384</a>. It is likely this is the last time in your professional career that you are obliged to renew your database certificates for AWS.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon MSK</strong> – Replicating Kafka clusters at scale is difficult and often involves managing the infrastructure and the replication solution by yourself. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-msk-replicator-fully-managed-replication-across-msk-clusters-in-same-or-different-aws-regions/\">We launched Amazon MSK Replicator</a>, a fully managed replication solution for your Kafka clusters, in the same or across multiple AWS Regions.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon CodeWhisperer</strong> – We launched a preview for an upcoming capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-customization-capability-in-amazon-codewhisperer-generates-even-better-suggestions-preview/\">You can now train CodeWhisperer on your private code base</a>. It allows you to give your organization’s developers more relevant suggestions to better assist them in their day-to-day coding against your organization’s private libraries and frameworks.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-seventh-generation-memory-optimized-amazon-ec2-instances-r7i/\">The seventh generation of memory-optimized EC2 instances is available</a> (R7i). These instances use the 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire_Rapids\">Sapphire Rapids</a>). This family of instances provides up to 192 vCPU and 1,536 GB of memory. They are well-suited for memory-intensive applications such as in-memory databases or caches.</p> \n<p><strong>X in Y</strong> – We launched existing services and instance types in additional Regions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-bedrock-europe-frankfurt-aws-region/\"><strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong> is now available in Europe (Frankfurt)</a>. This is important for customers in Europe because they often have to ensure their data stays in the European Union. You can now embed generative AI functionalities and access to large language models in your applications with the assurance that the prompts and customizations will stay in Europe.</li> \n <li><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> extended its footprint for multiple families of instances: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-ec2-m6gd-instances-additional-regions/\">m6gd instances are now available</a> in Canada (Central) and South America (São Paulo), <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-ec2-c6a-m6a-r6a-instances-additional-regions/\">c6a in Canada (Central), m6a in Canada (Central) and Europe (Milan), and r6a instances in US West (N. California) and Asia Pacific (Singapore)</a>. Finally, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-ec2-m6id-instances-additional-regions/\">m6id instances are now available</a> in Europe (Zurich).</li> \n <li><strong>Amazon EMR</strong> managed scaling is now available in Asia Pacific (Jakarta).</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span><br /> Here are some other blog posts and news items that you might like:</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://community.aws/\">Community.AWS</a> blog has new posts to teach you how to integrate <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> inside your <a href=\"https://community.aws/posts/amazon-bedrock-developing-java-applications\">Java</a> and <a href=\"https://community.aws/concepts/amazon-bedrock-golang-getting-started\">Go</a> applications, and my colleague <a href=\"https://github.com/brookejamieson\">Brooke</a> wrote a <a href=\"https://community.aws/posts/decoding-aws-reinvent-a-guide-for-first-timers\">survival guide for re:Invent first-timers</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Official AWS Podcast</strong></a> – Listen each week for updates on the latest AWS news and deep dives into exciting use cases.
