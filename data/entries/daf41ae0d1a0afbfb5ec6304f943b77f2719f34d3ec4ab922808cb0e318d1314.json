I went years avoiding warehouse stores, but here’s why I’m actually glad I did: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Sam’s Club Members can get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-608210&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnFIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">1-Year Membership</a> for only $20 (instead of $50). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how shopping at Sam’s Club is going so far. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 597 Sam’s Club warehouses in the US. That’s not just a fun piece of trivia. It’s something I learned because I just moved, and one of the things I’m most excited about is the Sam’s Club that’s only a 20-minute drive from my apartment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, there’s a grocery store that’s a little closer, but I can’t buy socks at my local grocery store. Or bulk energy drinks. Or a computer. At Sam’s Club, there’s a huge selection, so I might be able to get all my gifts, groceries, and bulk caffeine (it gets its own category because it is important to me) in one go. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I don’t feel like putting on shoes, Sam’s Club has an incredible selection online. And it’s not just shopping. There’s a whole section just for travel and entertainment. My next vacation might very well be courtesy of my Sam’s Club membership. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss your chance to get a<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-608210&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnFIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> One-Year Sam’s Club Membership</a> for $20. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-608210&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnFIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp3.stackassets.com/101c19ce72f8f022bda1a4dc71fcff11b506f974/store/85a4df24b0701ba8154c3e2bcaf10cbbdcc06442a048be96b04f83427e5f/sale_322614_primary_image.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sam’s Club 1-Year Membership with Auto-Renew! – $20</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=sams-club-1-year-membership-with-auto-renew&amp;utm_term=scsf-608210&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002WxnFIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"daf41ae0d1a0afbfb5ec6304f943b77f2719f34d3ec4ab922808cb0e318d1314","category":"Apple"}
