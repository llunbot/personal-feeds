{"title":"DOGE Dingalings Cut Off Funding for CVE Program","link":"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/16/homeland_security_funding_for_cve/","date":1744829812000,"content":"\n<p>Jessica Lyons, reporting for The Register:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>US government funding for the world’s CVE program — the\ncentralized Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database of\nproduct security flaws — ends Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>The 25-year-old CVE program plays a huge role in vulnerability\nmanagement. It is responsible overseeing the assignment and\norganizing of unique CVE ID numbers, such as <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160\">CVE-2014-0160</a>\nand <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754\">CVE-2017-5754</a>, for specific vulnerabilities, in this\ncase OpenSSL’s <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2014/04/09/heartbleed_explained/\">Heartbleed</a> and Intel’s <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/\">Meltdown</a>, so\nthat when referring to particular flaws and patches, everyone is\nagreed on exactly what we’re all talking about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The good news: they were ready. <a href=\"https://www.thecvefoundation.org/\">Announcing the CVE Foundation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a U.S.\ngovernment-funded initiative, with oversight and management\nprovided under contract. While this structure has supported the\nprogram’s growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among\nmembers of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality\nof a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single\ngovernment sponsor.</p>\n\n<p>This concern has become urgent following an April 15, 2025 letter\nfrom MITRE notifying the CVE Board that the U.S. government does\nnot intend to renew its contract for managing the program. While\nwe had hoped this day would not come, we have been preparing for\nthis possibility.</p>\n\n<p>In response, a coalition of longtime, active CVE Board members\nhave spent the past year developing a strategy to transition CVE\nto a dedicated, non-profit foundation. The new CVE Foundation will\nfocus solely on continuing the mission of delivering high-quality\nvulnerability identification and maintaining the integrity and\navailability of CVE data for defenders worldwide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/16/dingalings-cut-off-funding-for-cve\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6ebadba185fc480a64e3a50b6b36ec308a2bcbbc4085c389bd7d1bbb5df67f08","category":"Tech"}
