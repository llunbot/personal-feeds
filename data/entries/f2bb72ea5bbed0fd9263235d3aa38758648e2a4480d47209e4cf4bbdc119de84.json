The malware responsible is a variant of <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Linksys+Worm+TheMoon+Summary+What+we+know+so+far/17633\">TheMoon</a>, a malicious code family dating back to at least 2014. In its earliest days, TheMoon almost exclusively infected Linksys E1000 series routers. Over the years it <a href=\"https://blog-netlab-360-com.translate.goog/themoon-botnet-a-review-and-new-features/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US\">branched out</a> to targeting the Asus WRTs, Vivotek Network Cameras, and multiple D-Link models.</p>\n<p>In the years following its debut, TheMoon’s self-propagating behavior and growing ability to compromise a broad base of architectures enabled a growth curve that captured attention in security circles. More recently, the visibility of the Internet of Things botnet trailed off, leading many to assume it was inert. To the surprise of researchers in Lumen’s Black Lotus Lab, during a single 72-hour stretch earlier this month, TheMoon added 6,000 ASUS routers to its ranks, an indication that the botnet is as strong as it’s ever been.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012682#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012682&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f2bb72ea5bbed0fd9263235d3aa38758648e2a4480d47209e4cf4bbdc119de84","category":"Tech"}
