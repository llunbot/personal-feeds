These third-party services—such as USPS or UPS—are \"often slower\" than Amazon delivery drivers, and \"Amazon knew\" the switch \"would result in significantly slower deliveries for residents living in these two ZIP codes yet it never informed existing or prospective Prime members living there of that exclusion,\" the release said.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/amazon-secretly-slowed-deliveries-deceived-anyone-who-complained-lawsuit-says/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/amazon-secretly-slowed-deliveries-deceived-anyone-who-complained-lawsuit-says/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b0bc5b7dbcdc5737b4142989a8a220d7fabb7ac382f2fb2d87978cc8efda1891","category":"Tech"}
