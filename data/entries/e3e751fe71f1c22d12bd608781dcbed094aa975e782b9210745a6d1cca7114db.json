Such a launch likely remains months away, but it now appears that the feds will ultimately greenlight South Texas for orbital launches. That seemed far from assured before today.</p>\n<p>The document, formally called a Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment, evaluates the potential environmental impacts of SpaceX’s Starship program, including launch and reentry. It also reviews debris recovery, the integration tower and other launch-related construction, and local road closures between Brownsville and Boca Chica beach.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796263#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796263&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e3e751fe71f1c22d12bd608781dcbed094aa975e782b9210745a6d1cca7114db","category":"Tech"}
