While gravel adventure bikes and generalist gravel bikes offer ever-wider tyre clearance and numerous mounting points, gravel race bikes are in general much more pared back. Their geometry is often closer to road bikes and tyre clearance is more restricted, although there are exceptions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, bike makers will have both a gravel race bike and a gravel adventure bike in their range, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/specialized-diverge-vs-crux\">Specialized Crux and Diverge</a>. Specialized goes even further, offering the full suspension <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\">Diverge STR</a> in addition to the standard Diverge, indicating just how differentiated the gravel bike world has become.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">best gravel bikes</a> covers race, adventure and general options and you can read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-adventure-bikes\">best gravel adventure bikes</a> if you’re more into exploring.

The frame’s rigidity and short 415mm chainstays make up for that with efficient power transfer though. Head off-road and the bike is smooth and stable, making for rapid progress and descents. Despite the close tyre clearance, the frame stayed mud-free too. Six sizes allow you to get the right fit for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-racemax-first-ride-review\">3T Racemax

href=\"https://argonautcycles.com/supernaut-gr3/\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High-end frame in standard sizes and builds</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fast-riding and stable once at speed</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Argonaut custom-builds most of its bikes in Bend, Oregon to fit the rider, but the Supernaut GR3 is built to a standard geometry and carbon layup chosen by the high-end brand. There’s a choice of SRAM Red XPLR AXS or Shimano mullet builds with Argonaut D33 wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Argonaut Supernaut’s geometry took some getting used to. With a 68.5° head tube, it’s so slack that there’s a tendency for wheel flop at lower speeds. Once you hit a fast descent the bike comes alive though, offering stability and allowing you to hold more speed than you’d usually dare. The chainstays are short, but still offer 50mm tyre clearance and, helped by the 7.8kg bike weight for the XL size, lead to nimble climbing. It’s not aero-refined, but the Supernaut GR3 is rapid and flatters your skills when riding fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/argonaut-supernaut-gr3-review\">Argonaut Supernaut GR3 review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from<a href=\"https://argonautcycles.com/supernaut-gr3/\" target=\"_blank\"> Argonaut ($13,000) </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>BMC Kaius</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£11,350 | <a href=\"https://de.bmc-switzerland.com/collections/kaius-01-gravel-bikes/products/kaius-01-one-bikes-bmc-24-10624-004\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Borrows frame features and aerodynamics from the Teammachine road race bike</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Long seatpost extension helps keep the back end compliant</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The BMC Kaius borrows much of its design from the Teammachine road bike, including the aero tube profiles and bottle cages.

The top spec bike we reviewed weighs just 7.7kg, but BMC says it has reinforced the frame where bashes might happen when racing gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s decent 44m tyre clearance and 2x drivetrain compatibility, while the geometry is more relaxed than many gravel race bikes, leading to stable steering and a balanced ride once on gravel.

The Áspero’s fork incorporates a flip chip, designed to fine tune the ride when swapping between the two wheel sizes. The Áspero is not set up for mudguards, but you can add a top tube bag and third bottle cage for longer rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike’s climbing prowess impressed, thanks to a stiff frame, and it was fast downhill on tarmac too, attesting to its aero credentials and low ride position.

The flip side of the flip chips is some extra weight – around 8.9kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fiftyone-assassin-review\"> FiftyOne Assassin review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from<a href=\"https://fiftyonebikes.com/assassin/\" target=\"_blank\"> FiftyOne Bikes (frameset £2,999)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Open Upper</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"open_upper_sideon\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/07093556/open_upper_sideon.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>€3,500 (frameset) | <a href=\"https://opencycle.com/open-upper\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Road bike geometry with 40mm tyre clearance</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fast and fun on road and off-road</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/open-wide-gravel-bike-review\">Open Wide</a> does gravel adventure duties, the Upper is a different beast, despite space for 40mm tyres on 700c or 2.1 inch tyres on 650b rims.

In this, they’re much like the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-round-road-race-bikes\">best road race bikes</a>, with bike brands often using the same carbon fibre grades in their premium gravel race bikes as in their road bikes. You can choose a spec with premium components to shave weight off too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Specialized Crux, above, is the extreme example, but many of the best gravel race bikes hover around 8kg, a weight that would grace a road bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside, of course, is high price, but usually there are multiple specs that offer more affordable options with a slightly higher weight but similar ride qualities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical gravel race bike geometry veers close to that of road bikes, with steeper head tube angles and shorter wheelbases than gravel adventure bikes. This often leads to less tyre clearance than adventure gravel bikes, to keep the chainstays short for sharper handling. So whereas many gravel adventure bikes can fit 50mm tyres, gravel race bikes are often limited to 45mm or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are exceptions though, perhaps foremost being the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/argonaut-supernaut-gr3-review\"> Argonaut Supernaut GR3</a>. Its head tube angle is a very slack 68.5 degrees and its tyre clearance 50mm. You’d expect that to put it in the adventure category, but Argonaut’s sponsored rider Sarah Max says that the slack angles and stability <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/argonaut-gr3-gravel-bike\">help her to go faster</a> and win races thanks to the stability when descending rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty much every performance bike now has cable integration, with brake hoses and, where there are any, gear cables fully enclosed through the handlebars and stem and into the head tube. It’s a trend in gravel race bikes too which, along with aero profiled bars, improves front-end aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often integration means a one-piece bar and stem. It looks great and is more aero, but means any fit adjustment requires replacing the expensive bar/stem. It also precludes bar angle adjustment, so make sure you’re comfortable on your chosen component. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Integration is one factor in gravel race bike aerodynamics. As with road bikes, an aero frame profile is seen as a significant contributor of free speed in gravel races, so many gravel race bikes borrow aero tubes from their road bike brethren.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winning times in gravel races are getting faster, although in general average speeds are still lower than in road races. That means that the best gravel race bikes are often aero tested at lower speeds than road bikes. A case in point is the latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-superx-gravel-bike\">Cannondale SuperX</a>, which was aero tuned at 35km/h rather than the 45km/h Cannondale uses for its road race bikes. With the lower speeds, aero gains are lower but still significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aerobars are also often used in gravel races to lower wind resistance, so the option to fit them is handy. Aero profiled bar/stems may prevent this or limit the options available, so you may need to replace them with a conventional round bar and separate stem. Canyon has got around this with the Grail by selling aero extensions specifically designed to fit the bike’s custom double-drop bars. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gearing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the increasing speeds of gravel racing, the typical<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\"> gravel bike gearing</a> may be too low for some riders. Although complete bikes usually still come fitted with a gravel bike groupset, many gravel bikes are designed to allow riders to fit a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\">road bike groupset</a>. The Canyon Grail, for example, will accept a 52/36t semi-compact road bike crankset and many gravel race bikes can be fitted with chainrings larger than the subcompact cranksets typical for gravel bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want higher gearing for faster rides, many gravel race bikes can be bought frameset-only, so you can choose your own components and gear ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Load carrying</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most gravel race bikes cut down on the mounting points of generalist gravel bikes and gravel adventure bikes. Nevertheless, gravel racers still need to eat, drink and carry spares, so you’ll still typically see a third bottle mounting point under the down tube and top tube bag bolts. In-frame storage is often included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fork leg mounts and mudguard mounts are often absent though, so don’t expect most gravel race bikes to be able to do double duty as a load carrier or all-weather road bike, although there are exceptions. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>On-road use</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read through our detailed reviews of the best gravel race bikes, you’ll find that many of them perform pretty well on road too, as you might expect from the features listed above. They come at a similar space from the opposite direction to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">best all-road bikes</a>, which ride well on road but perform pretty well on light gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if your riding is more road than gravel an all-road bike may be the way for you to go rather than a gravel race bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-race-bikes\">Best gravel race bikes 2025 reviewed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5228895e06736d7dd64d74cf603bf28a6be30c84abc72c9561726884a84f2d05","category":"Cycling"}
