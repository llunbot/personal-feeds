The device that they had on display that was locking a bicycle to the floor of the display was super beefy and futuristic looking. The mechanism was a combination of products in Hiplok’s new innovative 1000 Series Line, which debuted at SOC ’24. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiplock’s 1000 Series line won the <a href=\"https://design-innovation-award.com/winner/hiplok-1000-series/\" target=\"_blank\">Design &amp; Innovation Award</a> for 2024, and upon looking it over at the Otter, I could see why, it seems pretty innovative. The Hiplok 1000 Series expands on the success of the 2021 Hiplok D1000, the original portable anti-angle grinder U Lock. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo.jpeg\" alt=\"SOC Coverage Hiplock's New 1000 Series use a combo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-use-a-combo-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Using all three of the new 1000 Series products.

These new locks and accessories are engineered with a graphene composite material technology. Hiplok says the new 1000 Series has “set a new standard in bike security, earning universal acclaim from independent testers and reviewers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hiplok’s 1000 Series Includes </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1000 Series range is built on the D1000, which is included in that series. But, I didn’t snap a photo of the D1000 while scoping the goods out at the Hiplok booth. I concentrated on the three brand-new products that were debuting. Let’s take a look at those. The entire 1000 Series line of products is independently tested and certified. They’ve all been rated Sold Secure Powered Cycle Diamond, and ART 4 Star.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case.jpeg\" alt=\"SOC Coverage Hiplock's New 1000 Series DX1000 U lock on case\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-DX1000-U-lock-on-case-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>DX1000</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The DX1000</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $349</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the new DX1000. This is a U lock that Hiplok calls the “ultimate anti-angle grinder U Lock”. It’s bigger than the OG D1000, and will fit a wider range of bicycles, including those fat down tubes of some modern eBikes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Large internal locking area</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimized for motorcycle and bicycle use</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compatible with A1000 &amp; AX1000 anchors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sold Secure Powered Cycle Diamond Rating</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lifetime warranty</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case.jpeg\" alt=\"SOC Coverage Hiplock's New 1000 Series AX1000 in the case\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-AX1000-in-the-case-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>AX1000</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The AX1000</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $449</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-ax1000/?nab=5\" target=\"_blank\">AX1000</a> is a cool product. It’s an anti-angle grinder anchor system with a long “fixed” reach anchor. It sports a 360° rotating base with a pivoting arm, helping you to reach your bike from any angle. For optimum security, use it with the D1000 or DX1000 U locks. The AX1000 can be used with any U lock. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pivoting extension arm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>360° rotational base</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compatible with D1000, DX1000, or any U Lock</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sold Secure Powered Cycle Diamond Rating</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lifetime warranty</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case.jpeg\" alt=\"SOC Coverage Hiplock's New 1000 Series A1000 in the case\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOC-Coverage-Hiplocks-New-1000-Series-A1000-in-the-case-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A1000</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The A1000</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $199</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiploc states that the <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-a1000/?nab=5\" target=\"_blank\">A1000</a> is the “world’s first anti-angle grinder anchor”. With its 360° rotating base, it’s easier to lock your steed in place with a D or U lock. Moving the A1000 to a wall and making it a wall anchor frees up valuable floor space. This allows the bicycle to sit very close to the anchoring wall. The A1000 can be mounted to a solid brick or concrete substrate. You can fit it to a wall or floor, inside or out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compact size</li>\n\n\n\n<li>360° rotational base</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compatible with D1000, DX1000, or any U Lock</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sold Secure Powered Cycle Diamond Rating</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lifetime warranty</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the details of Hiplok’s 1000 Series Line and other security options that fit your needs at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://hiplok.com/?nab=5\" target=\"_blank\">Hiplok.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hiplok-anti-angle-grinder-1000-series-locks-accessories/\">Hiplok Debuts New Anti-Angle Grinder 1000 Series Locks &amp; Accessories</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"054477a2b51019acb9e15b26b3d486f24cf27c8858e488277c8dce1087555a12","category":"Cycling"}
