Instead, Theranos continued to produce mounting losses. But that’s not what the company was telling investors, according to new documents shared during the jury trial of Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes.</p>\n<p>In court yesterday, jurors heard testimony from the company’s longtime chief financial officer, Danise Yam, who also goes by So Han Spivey. Yam said that Theranos lost $16.2 million in 2010, $27.2 million in 2011, $57 million in 2012, and $92 million in 2013. In 2013, things had “started to get a bit tight,” Yam said. There were weeks where the company was burning through around $2 million per week, and there wasn’t any revenue to help ameliorate the losses. In 2012 and 2013, Yam didn’t even bother adding a line for revenue—there was none.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795426#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795426&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3826d76409ac3705806b295f36af54f8ebcfec989844199427686c6a26e16886","category":"Tech"}
