The new firmware is 6A303, up from the 6A301 update that was released in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. Apple added multiple new ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 features in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> such as Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume, so there could be refinements to those updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can check your ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap General.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap About.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Look at the number next to \"Firmware Version.\"</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nIf we learn more about what's new in these firmware releases, we'll update this article.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-2/\">Apple Releases New Firmware for AirPods Pro 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-airpods-pro-2.2407106/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ef529f1da6e5107da40321cb5ce370eca038e3a90a78b560411800716f53d0f","category":"Apple"}
