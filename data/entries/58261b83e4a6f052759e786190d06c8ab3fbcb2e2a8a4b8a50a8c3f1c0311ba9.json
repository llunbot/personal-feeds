Fifteen minutes later, after shedding two strap-on boosters and a core stage powered by a Russian RD-180 engine, the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage released Starliner right on target to begin a nearly 26-hour pursuit of the space station. Docking at the space station is set for 12:15 pm EDT (16:15 UTC) Thursday, where NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will spend at least a week before coming back to Earth.</p>\n<p>In remarks shortly after Wednesday's launch, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wilmore and Williams, both former US Navy pilots, will \"test this thing from izzard to gizzard\" to ensure Boeing's Starliner is ready for operational six-month crew rotation missions to the ISS.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029190#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029190&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58261b83e4a6f052759e786190d06c8ab3fbcb2e2a8a4b8a50a8c3f1c0311ba9","category":"Tech"}
