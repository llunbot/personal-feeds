The Rocky Mountain Reaper Powerplay is Here","link":"https://bikerumor.com/full-suspension-electric-mountain-bike-for-kids-rocky-mountain-reaper-powerplay/","date":1720706400000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-boy-jumping-1536x1024.jpg\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, boy jumping\" /></p>\n<p>It was just a matter of time, but younger trail riders now have the option of going electric thanks to Rocky Mountain Bikes. RMB says their new Reaper Powerplay is the first mid-motor, full-suspension eMTB specifically designed for kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An all-new Dyname S4 Mini motor and drive system is the heart of the Reaper Powerplay. Add to that dropper posts, hydraulic disc brakes, and some kid-sized components, and you’ve got a fully legit trail eMTB for your upcoming shredder. Furthermore, the smaller wheeled 24” model adapts to 26” wheels so it can grow with your grom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rocky Mountain Reaper Powerplay:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, angle, forest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-forest-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reaper Powerplay features a FORM alloy frame with 130mms of rear travel driven by RMB’s mid-high pivot Smoothlink linkage. The frame is the same for the 24” and 26” wheeled models, but RMB has a few tricks up their sleeve to make it work with either wheel size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reapers get RockShox Deluxe Select rear shocks, and Manitou JUNIT 34 forks. The 26” bike gets the JUNIT Expert model with 140mm travel, and the 24” bike gets the Comp model with 120mm (please note the Manitou forks are not shown in the photos).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RMB includes a version of their ‘Ride’ chip on the Reaper Powerplay, but in this case, it’s a Ride 2 flip-chip. Flipping the chip optimizes the frame for 24” or 26” wheels, so the 24” model can accept the larger wheels and fit your growing kid for longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, chainstay flip chip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-dropout-chip-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To adapt the Reaper Powerplay for both wheel sizes, there is also a flip-chip in the chainstay. That does mean the 26” bike must be run in its Long setting, but the chainstay length can be adjusted on the 24” bike between its Short and Long positions. The frames are SRAM UDH compatible in Long mode only.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, adjustable headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-headset-adjustment-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The third adaptation to fit both wheel sizes is an adjustable reach headset. The 24” Reaper Powerplay comes with -5mm headset cups installed, and the 26” version comes with +5mm cups. The longer reach is necessary to fit a 26” wheel up front so the reach adjustment isn’t there as a preference option, it just makes it possible to run both wheel sizes. The +5mm cups will be available to order so you can grow the 24” Reaper into a 26”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Powertrain:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-motor.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-motor.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, Dyname S4 mini motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-motor.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-motor-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-motor-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-motor-768x432.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocky Mountain went to Dyname to develop an all-new S4 Mini motor, which was made specifically for the Reaper Powerplay. The S4 Mini motor puts out 40Nm of torque and 300W peak power (250W nominal). A torque sensor ensures smooth power delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the adult Powerplay eMTBs, the Reaper Powerplays offer four assist levels – Eco, Trail, Trail+, and Ludicrous. They also include the ability to fine-tune the drive system with two rider profiles that offer adjustable boost and assistance levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key feature for this grom-specific eMTB is the motor’s ‘kid mode’. This mode allows parents to limit the power output and the pedal assist’s top speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, mini remote\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-mini-remote-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>RMB’s Micro Remote handlebar-mounted controller allows for easy assist level changes, and access to the various info screens and configuration menus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, jumbotron\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-Jumbotron-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jumbotron display screen in the Reaper Powerplay’s top tube shows your key ride stats, and includes the bike’s power button.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, girl pedalling\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-girl-pedalling-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Power is supplied by an internal 240Wh battery. A 2A charger is included with the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-geo-chart.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-geo-chart.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, geo chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-geo-chart.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-geo-chart-297x169.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-geo-chart-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-geo-chart-768x438.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the Reaper Powerplay’s key angles are very similar to adult bikes. They offer slack, up-to-date head tube angles; The 26” version is 64°, and the 24” bike is 65.7°. For efficient pedaling, seat tube angles are steep at 76.5° (26”) and 78.3° (24”).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the above chart for the complete geometry of both models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Notes:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-handlebars-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Rocky Mountain made sure there were several kid-sized components on the Reaper Powerplays. First off, they come with 640mm wide RMB handlebars, with a 31.8mm clamp and 19mm diameter to accommodate junior-sized grips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tektro hydraulic disc brakes feature short reach levers, and the bikes run 180mm rotors. RMB made sure the cranks were appropriate for young rippers, stocking 155mm arms on the 26” bike, and 140mm on the 24” model. The Dyname motor also allows Rocky Mountain to run two-piece cranks in the Reaper Powerplays, instead of the three-piece cranks some motors require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The kids also get dropper posts! The 26” Reaper Powerplay offers an X-Fusion Manic 125mm dropper, and the 24” version runs a shorter 80mm version.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-CUES-derailleur.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-CUES-derailleur.jpg\" alt=\"RMB Reaper Powerplay, CUES derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-CUES-derailleur.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-CUES-derailleur-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-CUES-derailleur-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RMB-Reaper-Powerplay-CUES-derailleur-768x432.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few components that are not kid-specific include a Shimano CUES 10-speed drivetrain with an 11-48t cassette, and WTB KOM Team rims wrapped with Maxxis Minion tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reaper Powerplay will be available in one model for each wheel size.
