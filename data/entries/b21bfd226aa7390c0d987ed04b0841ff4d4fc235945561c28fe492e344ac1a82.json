Looking around the hotel meeting room, there are Grand Tour veterans and debutants. Matteo Trentin is a stage winner in all three Grand Tours and is about to embark on his 13th in total. Robin Froidevaux is completely new to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tosatto says there are eight bunch sprint opportunities in the 2024 Giro, and they are their best eight chances for a win. The team may be here at the race organiser’s discretion as a wild card invitation, but they haven’t turned up just to show off the sponsor’s name in doomed breakaways. Their style of racing aims to live up to their marketing tagline: Born to Dare. Besides, team owner Fabian Cancellara didn’t strive for mid-pack anonymity during his own career.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This race is the next step for one of the sport’s most ambitious up-and-coming squads. A ProTeam in the sport’s second tier since 2023, Tudor Pro Cycling have been making waves in the WorldTour this year, winning a bunch sprint with Arvid de Kleijn at Paris-Nice and the Tour de Romandie prologue with Maikel Zijlaard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Tosatto finishes, head of sports Ricardo Scheidecker stands up. Formerly of Leopard-Trek and QuickStep, the Portuguese motivates, plans and leads from the shadows. He doesn’t give many interviews – he’s a doer rather than a talker – but Trentin calls him the ‘engine’ of the squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We don’t have any stars, but we don’t need any stars. We showed that already this first part of the season,’ Scheidecker says. ‘The Giro is gonna be fucking tough. But these are the moments where unity helps us to move forward.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alberto Dainese, Matteo Trentin and Robin Froidevaux (seated, from left to right) listen intently to the pre-racing briefing ahead of another day’s racing at the Giro.</figcaption><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘If you’re here, it’s because you have character,’ he adds. ‘We are the underdogs, we always keep a low profile. When it’s tough, we keep our calm. We’re gonna mess up one, two, three sprints. That can happen, but you have to believe.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The selected riders have spent three weeks training at altitude at Sierra Nevada. They’ve ridden through a deluge on stage at the team presentation. They’re wearing new Tudor watches, the just-released Pelagos FXD Chrono ‘Cycling Edition’. They know this is a seismic moment in the team’s brief existence so far.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Swiss former pro and Tudor Pro Cycling owner Fabian Cancellara, who took over the team at the end of 2020.</figcaption><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The team’s CEO, Raphael Meyer, built like a human greyhound, skinny and bequiffed, delivers an emotive final flourish: ‘When we speak about belief and the will to do something great, today we can. And as many of you knew when we first thought about the Giro, it was about bringing someone who now looks down on us,’ he says. ‘We’re also here for Gino.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the promising Swiss stage racer Gino Mäder was set to join and lead the team in 2024 before his death in a crash at the Tour de Suisse in June 2023. ‘He would have been here and he’s proud up there. He’s proud,’ Meyer says. The room erupts into applause.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A team with time on its hands</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When <em>Cyclist</em> sits down for breakfast on the eve of the Giro in Tudor’s Turin hotel, the team’s press officer asks me how our car is. ‘It’s OK, just an Opel, nothing special,’ we reply at the curious opening gambit. That wasn’t what she meant. It transpires that Tudor Pro Cycling had three cars broken into in the hotel car park overnight, including Cancellara’s Mercedes. Cue a trip to the police station and precious time spent sourcing replacement glass. So much for a warm Giro d’Italia welcome.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The team started life humbly as Continental outfit Swiss Racing Academy, which Cancellara took over at the end of 2020, unwilling to see 16 riders’ dreams destroyed when it looked like the team might fold. Watchmaker Tudor’s involvement then upscaled the project and the scope of its ambitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tudor, part of the same Swiss company as Rolex, is a global brand with links to the All Blacks rugby team, Alinghi in sailing, and David Beckham (in his pre-race meeting, Meyer told the riders that they are all David Beckhams). The money the watch brand brings to the team means they now have the spending power to attract riders of the calibre of Trentin, Alberto Dainese and potentially Marc Hirschi, with whom they have been heavily linked for 2025. Meyer won’t be drawn on their budget: ‘We behave like Tudor in this: we don’t speak about time and money. We have time and a little money,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Matteo Trentin gives his son the best seat in the house as he soaks up the Grand Tour atmosphere.</figcaption><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>According to Meyer, the team’s motto – ‘Swiss, Human, Performance’ – is about building not just physically better cyclists but better people. That means working on communication skills and having open dialogue around success and failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s not about being in a comfort zone and happiness, but still a bit,’ Meyer says. One of his Giro goals is to avoid any ego trips or fights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a team with a WorldTour mindset, ambition and backroom experience thanks to staff additions such as Scheidecker, ex-Ineos Grenadiers data scientist Teun van Erp and mechanic Christophe Desimpelaere.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Tudor Pro Cycling’s riders get to grips with the Giro d’Italia’s transparent daily sign-in board.</figcaption><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘In year one, we spent more on salaries for staff than riders,’ Meyer says. ‘This probably never happened in a cycling team before. Why? Because we set the foundations to be right. Riders come and go, but the staff remain.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It’s a marathon, and also a sprint</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Four of the squad’s eight new riders in 2024 came from Dutch team DSM-Firmenich PostNL, including Dainese. A lot of their hopes for the Giro depend on the Italian, who has proven he can get over the mountains better than many rival fast men, which he translated into Giro stage wins in 2022 and 2023, as well as a stage win at the Vuelta in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite WorldTour interest, Dainese says joining Tudor is ‘a step up, not a step down’. However, his spring campaign was blighted by a February training crash, which saw him break teeth and damage his jaw. Injured riders can easily be forgotten in the cut and thrust of the cycling season.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I had a similar crash in 2022 and I felt so lonely. You only see the physio every day for rehab,’ he says. This year’s injury kept him away from racing for two months, but he was heartened by Tudor’s pastoral care, receiving regular calls from colleagues, be it his coach, the team doctor, fellow riders or sports directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the unparalleled support of a leadout train shaped around him, Dainese admits he’s feeling the pressure to perform before the Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The winning process is hard in cycling,’ road captain Trentin says. ‘Eight of the last ten Monuments were won by two guys. It’s dominated by a few actors, and you need to be good enough to sneak around them.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bunch sprinting has moved on since Trentin was part of Marcel Kittel’s leadout at QuickStep. ‘There’s more stress because of the level of the bunch. You need to increase your gearing, but the system is about timing, position, picking the right side of the road. It’s crazy because it takes a lot of time for a decision that takes seconds,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-09.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s a sweet spot between moving into place too late and burning out too early, says final leadout man Froidevaux: ‘One of the really important things is staying calm. Even though it’s a moment of chaos, it takes one bad choice to ruin everything.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Tour de France stage winner Trentin, signed from UAE Team Emirates, shows the scale of Tudor Pro Cycling’s ambition, 25-year-old Grand Tour debutant Froidevaux is a sign of their continuity and rider development. He was part of the Swiss Racing Academy squad when it was upscaled to Tudor in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was expecting it to change, to grow, but not this much, this fast and this well,’ Froidevaux says. ‘Last year the lineup was mainly riders who were under the radar or unknown. And we won quite a lot of races.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tudor Pro Cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tudor-pro-cycling-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Tudor’s experienced directeur sportif Bart Leysen imparts some words of wisdom to his riders.</figcaption><figcaption>David Powell / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Thoroughbred sprinter De Kleijn led the way for the team with six victories, including Milano-Torino and a stage of the Deutschland Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A winner’s approach to losing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giro’s first two stages come and go without much attacking intent. While Tadej Pogačar goes on the rampage, Tudor’s riders are saving energy for the bunch sprints, although Tudor’s Michael Storer attacks on the way to sixth at Santuario di Oropa, his best finish of the race. It’s the start of a resurgent showing from the Australian climber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 3 between Novara and Fossano is their first real opportunity for success.

With a masters and PhD in exercise physiology and nutrition, the Briton has introduced some interesting innovations to the Tudor setup in the chase for performance benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the team’s Assos skinsuit: rather than simply sourcing a generic offering, Tudor worked with the Swiss company to develop three – for sprints, Classics and climbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Ultimately, we’re in the results business,’ says Bergin-Taylor, who is also coach to the likes of Alberto Dainese and Arvid de Kleijn. ‘But definitely in the short-term phase of the team, it’s all about the process. We have various things we measure, whether it be aerodynamic drag with certain riders or the speed of sprints with our key sprinters.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maikel Zijlaard’s Tour de Romandie prologue win shows the fruits of the team’s balanced focus between innovation and perspiration. A corkscrewing 2.28km course with 12 corners meant a win could be meticulously reverse-engineered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they identified the right man for the job – a Dutch former track rider turned leadout man with a big anaerobic threshold – and devised specific training sessions to replicate the accelerations and decelerations needed for the staccato effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after analysing the course in their simulations, they opted for a road bike with a disc wheel and deep-section front wheel over a TT bike. The result? The team’s second WorldTour win and first in their native Switzerland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 156 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/best-bikes-groupsets-wheels-pro-cycling-2024\">Which bike brands, groupsets and wheels won the most at Grand Tours in 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-2024-chris-auld\">Behind the scenes at the Giro d’Italia with photographer Chris Auld</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Giro d’Italia 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tudor-pro-cycling-giro-ditalia\">Grand Tour first-timers: Tudor Pro Cycling at the Giro d’Italia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b21bfd226aa7390c0d987ed04b0841ff4d4fc235945561c28fe492e344ac1a82","category":"Cycling"}
