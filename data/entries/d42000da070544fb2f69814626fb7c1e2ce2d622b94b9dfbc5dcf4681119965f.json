PHL Innovation Fest, in a chat with Youngmoo Kim, director of Drexel’s ExCITe Center. Him, interviewing me, about the stuff I do and have done. I’ve known Youngmoo for a few years — this will be good. In-person attendance has been scrapped because of COVID-19 (they haven’t updated the website to make this clear), but virtual attendance registration is open and is now free of charge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bphlfest.com/event/a0063279-7aa6-42ae-9ccc-712577ada0f9/websitePage:645d57e4-75eb-4769-b2c0-f201a0bfc6ce\">Good lineup of keynote speakers too</a>, including Don Lemon and Sixers president Daryl Morey. (If I see him backstage, I’ll try to get the scoop <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/ben-simmons-joel-embiid-sixers-nba-trade-rumors-20210928.html\">on Ben Simmons</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/28/yours-truly-at-b-phl\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d42000da070544fb2f69814626fb7c1e2ce2d622b94b9dfbc5dcf4681119965f","category":"Tech"}
