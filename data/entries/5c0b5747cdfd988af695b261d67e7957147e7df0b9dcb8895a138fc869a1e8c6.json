Best Buy's price drop comes just hours after Walmart <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip/\">started selling</a> the M1 MacBook Air for $699.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/M1-MacBook-Air-Deals-Feature-Warm.jpg\" width=\"2125\" height=\"1195\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

The model that Best Buy has for $649.99 is the entry-level version with 8GB Unified Memory, an 8-core CPU, a 7-core GPU, and a 256GB SSD.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://howl.me/clLm50orOos\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$350 OFF</div>13-inch M1 MacBook Air for $649.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple discontinued the M1 MacBook Air on March 4, which is why we're seeing such low prices on remaining inventory. The M1 MacBook Air first came out in 2020, so it is four years old at this point, but the Apple silicon chip is still more than adequate for day-to-day tasks. <a href=\"https://howl.me/clLm50orOos\">$649 is a great price</a> for those who want to get an Apple silicon Mac while also saving some cash.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs the M1 MacBook Air is no longer being manufactured, available supply is likely to dry up soon.
