Travel from some countries — including Ireland, Norway and Germany — fell by more than 20 per\ncent, an FT analysis of ITA data showed.</p>\n\n<p>The trend poses a threat to the US tourism industry, which\naccounts for 2.5 per cent of the country’s GDP. Some airlines and\nhotel groups have warned of waning demand for transatlantic travel\nand a “bad buzz” about visiting the US. The total number of\noverseas visitors travelling to the US dropped by 12 per cent\nyear-on-year in March, the steepest decline since March 2021 when\nthe travel sector was reeling from pandemic restrictions,\naccording to the ITA data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, I’m sure it will turn around when the April figures come out, after Trump’s tariff madness and the news that Secretary of State Marco Rubio — supposedly one of the few sane voices in the 2.0 Trump kakistocracy — <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/mahmoud-khalil-memo-marco-rubio-deport-beliefs\">has signed a two-page argument that noncitizens can be deported for their beliefs</a>, a.k.a. thought crimes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“In just two months [Trump] has destroyed the reputation of the\nUS, shown one way by diminished travel from the EU to the US,”\nsaid Paul English, co-founder of travel website Kayak. “This is\nnot only one more terrible blow to the US economy, it also\nrepresents reputation damage that could take generations to\nrepair.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We need more clearheaded statements like this from business leaders. Just state the truth plainly. The only side English took with this statement is the side of the truth.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/11/european-travel-to-the-us-plummets\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"33c3184fcb17941530a0cd18635eebea6a576dd66edf2bd2aca943548506210a","category":"Tech"}
