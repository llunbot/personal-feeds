The functionality will be linked to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>, and it will be introduced in an AirPods software update planned for later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/airpods-pro-2-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe AirPods will be able to provide a simpler translation process for people who are speaking different languages, though the process will rely on the Translate app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf an English speaker with AirPods is talking to someone who is speaking Spanish, the ‌iPhone‌ will detect the audio, translate the speech, and relay it back in English to the person wearing AirPods. The person speaking English will then be able to respond and have their response translated to Spanish and spoken aloud by the ‌iPhone‌. Apple's ‌iPhone‌ Translate app can already be used for conversations like this, but having the function included in the AirPods will streamline the exchange.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo go along with the new AirPods feature, Apple is also planning to improve the Translate app in ‌iOS 19‌, though no details are available at this time. While Apple is working on new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/\">AirPods Pro 3</a> earbuds that are set to launch in 2025, it sounds like Apple might bring the ‌iOS 19‌ Translate feature to existing models as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been tying AirPods updates to iOS updates in recent years. In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, for example, Apple added a suite of hearing health capabilities that test for hearing issues and allow the AirPods to be used as a hearing aid if problems are detected.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/\">AirPods Getting Live Translation Feature Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-getting-live-translation-feature-later-this-year.2453054/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0695c7c9ffa937ddfac221d14f93318fe9bd81266f48534f3ec0cd85faf30485","category":"Apple"}
