The increase \"surely means a larger battery,\" according to the leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqQrs9PB\">remains unchanged</a>, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUp until now, we have not heard any rumors about a battery life increase for the iPhone 17 Pro Max or a change in dimensions, so if Ice Universe's information is accurate, this would be a new development. \r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 17 Proâ€Œ models are expected to have a large rectangular camera bump with rounded corners, though Apple apparently plans to stick with a triangular arrangement for the rear camera lenses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's premium devices are also rumored to have an aluminum frame, whereas the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have a titanium frame. The back of the devices will supposedly also have a new \"part-aluminum, part-glass\" design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIce Universe also claimed today that the iPhone 17 Pro Max and Apple's all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-air-same-size-iphone-16-pro-max/\">share identical dimensions</a> apart from the differing thickness of the devices. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/\">Ice Universe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/\">iPhone 17 Pro Max Said to Be Thicker to Accommodate Larger Battery</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-max-said-to-be-thicker-to-accommodate-larger-battery.2452321/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"716f06d040cd7613e2831b38755c0b57cd02350af084d85c05e1cab0b938d82c","category":"Apple"}
