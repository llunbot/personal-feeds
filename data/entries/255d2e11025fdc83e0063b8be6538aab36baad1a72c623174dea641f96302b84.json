Below, we outline everything to know about these emulators and available options so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Emulators-in-the-App-Store-What-to-Know-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThis information is up to date as of April 2024, but Apple's policies could change over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>What is Allowed</h2>\r<br />\nApple told us that emulators that can load games (ROMs) are permitted on the App Store, so long as the apps are emulating \"retro console games\" only.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple would not tell us which consoles it classifies as retro, but developer Riley Testut's popular emulator Delta is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/\">now available on the App Store</a>, and it can emulate games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Nintendo 64, and Nintendo DS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Emulators-in-the-App-Store-What-to-Know-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThere is also a Commodore 64 emulator on the App Store called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emu64-xl/id6483251916\">Emu64 XL</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have not come across any other fully-functioning emulators on the App Store released after the rule change, but more will likely be available in the future. Apple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/\">removed an emulator called iGBA</a> from the App Store for ripping off Testut's code for Delta and its predecessor GBA4iOS, while the developer of NES emulator Bimmy <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/nes-emulator-bimmy-for-iphone-in-app-store/\">decided to remove the app</a> from the App Store to avoid the risk of legal action from Nintendo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Legality</h2>\r<br />\nWhile a U.S. court <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp.\">ruled</a> that emulators are legal, downloading copyrighted ROMs is typically against the law in the country. On its <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55888/~/intellectual-property-%26-piracy-faq\">customer support website</a> in the U.S., Nintendo says that downloading pirated copies of its games is illegal:<blockquote>Pirate copies of game files are often referred to as \"ROMs\".\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe uploading and downloading of pirate copies of Nintendo games is illegal.</blockquote>Nintendo recently sued the developers of Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu for \"facilitating piracy at a colossal scale,\" leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement\">reported $2.4 million settlement</a>. Nintendo has yet to comment on the availability of emulators in the App Store, but Delta and its predecessor GBA4iOS have been available on the iPhone outside of the App Store for over a decade now without being shut down. Nintendo did <a href=\"https://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/05/14/nintendo-strikes-gba4ios-with-dmca-takedown-notice/\">issue a DMCA takedown notice</a> against the GBA4iOS website in 2014, but the emulators have continued to remain available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those who want to abide by the letter of the law, it is generally legal to download and play <a href=\"https://hh.gbdev.io/\">\"homebrew\" games</a> available in the public domain.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emulator/\">Emulator</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/what-to-know-about-iphone-app-store-emulators/\">What to Know About Apple Allowing Game Emulators in the App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-know-about-apple-allowing-game-emulators-in-the-app-store.2424395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"255d2e11025fdc83e0063b8be6538aab36baad1a72c623174dea641f96302b84","category":"Apple"}
