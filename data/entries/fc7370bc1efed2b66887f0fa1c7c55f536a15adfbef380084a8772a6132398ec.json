It’s a declaration. It’s a declaration of unity and love and respect. And it means a lot. And it’s something very special to our country.</p>\n\n<p>Watch the clip. A transcript doesn’t do justice to just how clear it is he has no idea what it means. I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/11/china-calls-trump-a-joke\">keep</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/04/trump-doesnt-know-if-he-needs-to-uphold-the-constitution\">mentioning</a> that Democrats should hammer, every day, the argument that Trump is way too old and now suffering from dementia. It’s just good politics. But I think it’s actually true, too. Mark my words, by the time he gets toward the end of this second term they’re going to have to somehow try to keep him away from microphones. You can’t get out of the fourth grade without being able to describe what the Declaration of Independence means.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/04/trump-declaration\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fc7370bc1efed2b66887f0fa1c7c55f536a15adfbef380084a8772a6132398ec","category":"Tech"}
