Despite the relatively unconvincing cover story concocted \nby the suspect, including the use of a clearly non-government \nProtonMail email address, Verizon handed over the victim’s data to \nthe alleged stalker, including their address and phone logs. The \nstalker then went on to threaten the victim and ended up driving \nto where he believed the victim lived while armed with a knife, \naccording to the record. </p>\n\n<p>The news is a massive failure by Verizon who did not verify that \nthe data request was fraudulent, and the company potentially put \nsomeone’s safety at risk. [...] As the complaint against Glauner \nnotes, this “search warrant” was not correctly formatted and did \nnot include an additional form that is required for search \nwarrants in North Carolina. That, and the Cary Police Department \nconfirmed that no such Steven Cooper is employed with the agency, \nthe document says. The judge who allegedly signed the document, \nGale Adams, was shown the document and told investigators the \nsignature was not hers either. Most obviously of all, the document \nwas sent with a ProtonMail email address, which is “not an \nofficial government email address,” the complaint says. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Disgraceful.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/09/verizon-handed-data-to-stalker\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fd7bb9fc8d46f402d5af2a959483eb4811ccb759afb211ec90fa8c4a14483c5d","category":"Tech"}
