With Keyframer, users can create animated illustrations from static 2D images via natural language prompting. Using GPT-4 3, Keyframer generates CSS animation code to animate an input Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG).\"</blockquote>To create an animation, the user uploads an SVG image – of a space rocket, say – then types in a prompt like \"generate three designs where the sky fades into different colors and the stars twinkle.\" Keyframer then generates CSS code for the animation, and the user can then refine it by editing the code directly or by entering additional text prompts. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Keyframer enabled users to iteratively refine their designs through sequential prompting, rather than having to consider their entire design upfront,\" explain the authors. \"Through this work, we hope to inspire future animation design tools that combine the powerful generative capabilities of LLMs to expedite design prototyping with dynamic editors that enable creators to maintain creative control.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the paper, the research was informed by interviews with professional animation designers and engineers. \"I think this was much faster than a lot of things I've done,\" said one of the study participants quoted in the paper. \"I think doing something like this before would have just taken hours to do.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ai-model-animates-images-1.jpg\" width=\"1779\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nThe innovation is just the latest in a series of AI breakthroughs by Apple. Last week, Apple researchers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-ai-model-edits-images-natural-language/\">released</a> an AI model that harnesses the power of multimodal LLMs to perform pixel-level edits on images. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn late December, Apple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-ai-researchers-run-llms-iphones/\">revealed</a> that it had made strides in deploying LLMs on iPhones and other Apple devices with limited memory by inventing an innovative flash memory utilization technique.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu have said that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/\">later in the year</a>, when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> is released.
