Most of this growth will be driven by laptops, but the number of OLED tablets will also increase sharply during this period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe main contributor to this expected increase is said to be Apple's expanded use of OLED displays across its devices. In line with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/06/samsung-lg-preparing-for-oled-ipads-report/\">other rumors</a>, Omdia believe that Apple will begin using OLED panels for the ‌iPad‌ starting with new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models next year, followed by an OLED MacBook Pro in 2026. Apple will almost entirely phase out LCD and mini-LED displays on mobile devices by 2026. The report also mentions a foldable 20-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ model with an OLED around this time frame.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2027, Apple will apparently begin using QD-OLED or WOLED panels for 32-inch and 42-inch displays, likely for future <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> or external display models. The Pro Display XDR is Apple's only existing product with a 32-inch display and there is no currently 42-inch device.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/omdia/\">Omdia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/22/apple-planning-32-and-42-inch-oled-displays-2027/\">Apple Reportedly Planning 32- and 42-Inch OLED Displays for 2027 Amid Switch to New Panel Technology</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-planning-32-and-42-inch-oled-displays-for-2027-amid-switch-to-new-panel-technology.2387481/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"20ac3f1074328d9c69119e947d30fbcfa7386778724d8b213126e14b64dc2d97","category":"Apple"}
