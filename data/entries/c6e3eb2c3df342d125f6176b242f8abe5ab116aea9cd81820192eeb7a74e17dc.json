Ibis announced today that they would be increasing their warranty from 7-years to lifetime, while reflecting “their existing policy of honoring warranty claims for defective products regardless of purchase date”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The warranty will cover the typical “defects in materials and workmanship for the original owner,” meaning it will not cover “damages due to driving into your garage door, casing a Rampage-sized step-down, or intentional damage.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the new warranty policy is retroactive, it only dates back to January 1, 2023. Anything purchased in 2022 or prior is still subject to their previous 7-year warranty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To register your bike for warranty, or check the fine print, follow the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ibiscycles.com/support/warranty?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;_kx=vNOoBHzdniDtlX3645N-c-vZpcTpp_hgXKrhXqwebF8%3D.WE4mZm\" target=\"_blank\">ibiscycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ibis-new-lifetime-warranty-frames-rims-wheels/\">Ibis Announces New Lifetime Warranty on All Frames, Rims, and Wheels</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c6e3eb2c3df342d125f6176b242f8abe5ab116aea9cd81820192eeb7a74e17dc","category":"Cycling"}
