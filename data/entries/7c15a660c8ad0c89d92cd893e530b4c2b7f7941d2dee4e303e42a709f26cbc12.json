However, the C1 modem does not extend to the new iPads unveiled earlier this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M3-iPad-Air.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-c1-modem-ipad\"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber today said</a> he spoke with an Apple representative who confirmed that the new iPad Air and entry-level iPad models are not equipped with the C1 modem. In addition, FCC documents viewed by <em>MacRumors</em> indicate that cellular configurations of both new iPads are equipped with a Qualcomm modem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is still at least one other device that is expected to have an Apple-designed modem this year. According to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the rumored \"iPhone 17 Air\" model coming in September will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">also be equipped with the C1 modem</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-c1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple's modem supply agreement with Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/\">runs through March 2027</a>, so the company still has time to transition to its own custom-designed modems. Apple develops chips several years before they ship, so it should come as no surprise that the company is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-integrate-future-modems-main-processor/\">already working on its next-generation C2 and C3 modems</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said the C1 modem is already the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">most power-efficient iPhone modem ever</a>, and it held up fine in both real-world and simulated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-c1-modem-5g-speed-tests/\">5G speed test results</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/c1/\">C1</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-ipads-lack-apple-c1-modem/\">New iPads This Week Aren't Equipped With Apple's C1 Modem for 5G</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipads-this-week-arent-equipped-with-apples-c1-modem-for-5g.2452112/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7c15a660c8ad0c89d92cd893e530b4c2b7f7941d2dee4e303e42a709f26cbc12","category":"Apple"}
