Its secret lies in the “<em>coccyx connection</em>“. By extending a unique ‘Spur’ up from the rear of the otherwise normal saddle design, SaddleSpur promises more rider comfort and efficiency by reducing lower back pain and “bum ache” by giving you something to push up against.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SaddleSpur unique ergonomic saddle design with rear support</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike.jpg\" alt=\"SaddleSpur unique ergonomic cycling saddle design with rear coccyx support, complete bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_complete-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/SaddleSpur)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed by John Downing to make riding a road bike more comfortable, this SaddleSpur saddle is the realization of almost a decade of development to make cycling “better”.

We love riding. But we don’t love it when riding hurts. Lower-back pain, saddle sore, bum ache – whatever you call it, it slows you down and sucks the joy out of cycling. That’s why we created SaddleSpur.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a ‘spur’ extending up from the rear of the saddle, the rider does not have to pull on the bars and strain their shoulders and lower back to push down into the pedals. An extension of the 7mm round aluminum rails from the conventional front half of the saddle transfers forces to the seatpost clamp, taking strain out of your lower back.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_prototype.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1350\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_prototype.jpg\" alt=\"SaddleSpur unique ergonomic cycling saddle design with rear coccyx support, prototype\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_prototype.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_prototype-297x242.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_prototype-800x652.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_prototype-120x98.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_prototype-768x626.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The unique spur design helps anchor the rider and gives them a surface to push against, enabling more power to transfer to the pedals.

Either to simply change weight balance of respond to a panic stop. Downing admits that a new “<em>riding experience does involve a change in body dynamics. In an [sic] situation where the instinct is to shift backwards on the saddle, with SaddleSpur the instinct shifts to transfer the force through the arms – to arrest the body from projecting forward</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounds a bit scary to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view.jpg\" alt=\"SaddleSpur unique ergonomic cycling saddle design with rear coccyx support, top view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view-800x360.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view-768x346.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SaddleSpur-unique-ergonomic-cycling-saddle-design-with-rear-coccyx-support_top-view-1536x691.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Downing describes the SaddleSpur as a flat profile, short-fit style saddle, suitable for men and women.
