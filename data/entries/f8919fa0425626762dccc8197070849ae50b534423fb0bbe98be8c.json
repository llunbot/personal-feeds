That must be a future where Apple no longer exists. In the future where Apple exists, Apple will release AR glasses that actually look good, not like some sort of instrument at your ophthalmologist. Then a year later Xiaomi (and their brethren companies) will release AR glasses that look as shamelessly like Apple’s as they can get away with.
