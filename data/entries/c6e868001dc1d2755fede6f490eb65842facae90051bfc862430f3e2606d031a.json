No date has yet been put forward for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Typically, during this interim period, nominees meet with Senators behind closed doors before their hearings and limit public comments that could put them in the hot seat during the confirmation process.</p>\n<p>This has meant that we've heard little from the person who is in line to lead NASA over the next four years as the space agency confronts a number of issues. These include reconfiguring the Artemis Program, a potential pivot toward Mars, an aging International Space Station, Mars Sample Return, a limited pipeline of science missions, and the likelihood of budget cuts. On top of all of this there is the uncertainty and unease federal workers face as the Trump Administration scrutinizes their activities for efficiency and, in some cases, loyalty.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-nominee-previews-his-vision-for-the-agency-mars-hard-work-inspiration/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-nominee-previews-his-vision-for-the-agency-mars-hard-work-inspiration/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c6e868001dc1d2755fede6f490eb65842facae90051bfc862430f3e2606d031a","category":"Tech"}
