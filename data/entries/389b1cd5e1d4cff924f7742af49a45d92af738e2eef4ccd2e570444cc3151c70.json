Feasting on the gas can cause some weird (heavenly) bodily functions.</p>\n<p>AT 2021hdr is a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH) system in the center of a <a href=\"https://www.wis-tns.org/object/2021hdr\">galaxy</a> 1 billion light-years away, in the Cygnus constellation. In 2021, researchers observing it using NASA’s Zwicky Transient Facility saw strange outbursts that were flagged by the ALerCE (Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events) team.</p>\n<p>This active galactic nucleus (AGN) flared so brightly that AT 2021hdr was almost mistaken for a supernova. Repeating flares soon ruled that out. When the researchers questioned whether they might be looking at a tidal disruption event—a star being torn to shreds by the black holes—something was still not making sense. They then compared observations they made in 2022 using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to simulations of something else they suspected: a tidal disruption of a gas cloud by binary supermassive black holes. It seemed they had found the most likely answer.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/supermassive-black-hole-binary-emits-unexpected-flares/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/supermassive-black-hole-binary-emits-unexpected-flares/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"389b1cd5e1d4cff924f7742af49a45d92af738e2eef4ccd2e570444cc3151c70","category":"Tech"}
