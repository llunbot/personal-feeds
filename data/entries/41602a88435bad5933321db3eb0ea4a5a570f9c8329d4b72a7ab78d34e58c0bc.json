The X3 now features fully internal routing, 50mm tire clearance, and UDH compatibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What hasn’t changed about the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/t-lab-x3-s-custom-titanium-gravel-bike-bikerumor/\" target=\"_blank\">X3</a> are the things that helped make the previous iteration <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/t-lab-x3-s-custom-titanium-gravel-bike-rockshox-rudy-review/\" target=\"_blank\">T-Lab’s most popular bike</a>, namely a sublime level of comfort and competition-ready power transfer. A uniquely shaped titanium tubeset using T-Labs proprietary T-Morph technology delivers, according to T-Labs testing, “up to 30% more lateral stiffness and related responsiveness” than some other titanium frames. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1122\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.16.40-PM.png\" alt=\"T-lab X3 studio front 3/4 shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.16.40-PM.png 1122w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.16.40-PM-297x209.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.16.40-PM-120x84.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.16.40-PM-768x539.png 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The geometry is mostly progressive with a slack 71.5 head angle, long front-center, low bottom bracket, and a trail figure of 67mm. The only dimension that really bucks the trend of gravel geometry is the conservatively long chainstays, which are 430mm. While this length might not maximize sprinting responsiveness or out-of-saddle traction, it will certainly aid in keeping riders more comfortable over the long haul, and will add a pinch of handling confidence on rough terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1664\" height=\"719\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.06.03-PM-1.webp\" alt=\"T-Lab x3 geo chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.06.03-PM-1.webp 1664w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.06.03-PM-1-297x128.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.06.03-PM-1-1536x664.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.06.03-PM-1-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.06.03-PM-1-768x332.webp 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The X3 is available in 5 stock sizes that accommodate riders 5’1″ to 6’6″. For riders who fall outside this range, T-Lab offers custom sizing for an additional $600. Selecting the correct size in the X3 requires some attention, because depending on how it will be used, a rider may need to go down two sizes from a typical road bike fit. For instance, a size “small” X3 has a reach of 400mm, a stack of 566mm, and a seatube length of 500mm – similar dimensions to a Specialized Aethos 56cm, which is considered a “large” frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Versus a road bike, most riders will likely drop down just one size, and also use a shorter stem to retain some agility in the front end of the X3. This combination of a smaller-labeled frame with a shorter stem will provide the best balance of comfort for long rides and races, and the playfulness needed to enjoy the gnarlier end of the gravel spectrum.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1682\" height=\"482\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.10.25-PM.webp\" alt=\"aesthetic design options of the T-Lab x3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.10.25-PM.webp 1682w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.10.25-PM-297x85.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.10.25-PM-1536x440.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.10.25-PM-120x34.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.10.25-PM-768x220.webp 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but nobody will accuse the X3 of being a forgettable metal bike. The top tube’s flattened profile makes for an acute transition to the oversized headtube. The downtube also transitions to a flat profile as it approaches the BB386 bottom bracket, and the slender seat stays are linked to the seat tube with a stout section of titanium that may not be super elegant, but looks up to the task of anchoring fully loaded panniers for the roughest gravel touring one can dream up. Overall, it’s clear that the X3’s form follows its function, as should be the norm for performance gravel bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1046\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.17.22-PM.png\" alt=\"T-Lab X3 front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.17.22-PM.png 1046w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.17.22-PM-297x182.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.17.22-PM-120x73.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.17.22-PM-768x470.png 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The X3 can be built, finished, and painted to your taste, with options for both 1x and 2x mechanical, Di2, and wireless shifting, along with three distinct aesthetic designs – Lux, HLX, and Versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1115\" height=\"778\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.18.27-PM.png\" alt=\"T-Lab X3 Di2 rear derailleur wiring on top of chainstay\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.18.27-PM.png 1115w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.18.27-PM-297x207.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.18.27-PM-120x84.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-9.18.27-PM-768x536.png 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The X3 looks to be a versatile bike that will be more than competent in any gravel theater – whether that’s Unbound, the Continental Divide, or your local singletrack. The geometry embraces many contemporary trends but retains some long-standing dimensions to balance fun and comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The X3 is available now with framesets starting at $3110 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://t-lab-bikes.com/en-ca/bikes/x3\" target=\"_blank\">t-lab-bikes.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/t-lab-x3-gravel-bike-update-udh/\">Oh, Canada!
