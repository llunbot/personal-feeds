These titanium parts are currently CNC machined.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe change has the potential to improve production time and reduce costs. If shipments from suppliers go well, Kuo believes more Apple products will adopt 3D printing technology in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUntil now, only <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> had said that Apple would release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/apple-roadmap-2023-24-15-new-devices/\">second-generation Apple Watch Ultra</a> alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> models later this year. Thus, Kuo's latest report seems to add further credibility to the belief that the ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ will follow the same annual update cycle as the standard Apple Watch series.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/14/2023-apple-watch-ultra-with-3d-printed-parts/\">Kuo: New Apple Watch Ultra to Launch This Year With 3D-Printed Parts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-new-apple-watch-ultra-to-launch-this-year-with-3d-printed-parts.2395901/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cdf33327652c0ccc5005342703948a93c42bcaf739b8e06e858b08f2e6d36c7a","category":"Apple"}
