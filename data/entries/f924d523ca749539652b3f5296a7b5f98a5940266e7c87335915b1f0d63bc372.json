Well, this 8-in-1 Baseus Nomos magnetic charging station can solve that problem for you for just $49 from Amazon’s Woot, nearly half off its $90 MSRP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charging station cuts out the need for power strips on your desk, as well as for other chargers, thus enabling you to have a better-organized desk. There are three AC outlets available, as well as three USB-C and a USB-A port on the sides. iPhone users will also love the MagSafe wireless charging pad, which can be oriented flat or raised. And with its nifty design that lets you raise it up to 60 degrees, you can still check your phone while charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot is an Amazon company, so you can get the same Prime benefits you do with the main site, including free shipping. Amazon itself has the Baseus Nomos on sale too, but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG2VX9TF/\">it’s $60 there</a> since Woot usually offers better prices on overstocked items.
