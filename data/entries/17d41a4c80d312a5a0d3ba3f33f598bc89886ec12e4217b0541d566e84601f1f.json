What the group lacks in software exploitation, it makes up for with persistence and creativity. One example is their technique for bypassing MFA (multi-factor authentication) at well-defended organizations.</p>\n<h2>Studying the Lapsus$ hacking playbook</h2>\n<p>Rather than compromising infrastructure used to make various MFA services work, as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/12/solarwinds-hackers-have-a-clever-way-to-bypass-multi-factor-authentication/\">more advanced groups do</a>, a Lapsus$ leader last year described his approach to defeating MFA this way: “Call the employee 100 times at 1 am while he is trying to sleep, and he will more than likely accept it. Once the employee accepts the initial call, you can access the MFA enrollment portal and enroll another device.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960309#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960309&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"17d41a4c80d312a5a0d3ba3f33f598bc89886ec12e4217b0541d566e84601f1f","category":"Tech"}
