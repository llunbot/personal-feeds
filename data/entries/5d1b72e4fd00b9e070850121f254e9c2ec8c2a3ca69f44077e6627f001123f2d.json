{"title":"Wirecutter Goes Behind The New York Times’s Paywall","link":"https://www.nytco.com/press/the-new-york-times-company-launches-digital-subscriptions-for-wirecutter/","date":1630703840000,"content":"\n<p>The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The New York Times Company announced today that Wirecutter, its\nproduct recommendation service, will institute a metered paywall,\nasking its frequent users to subscribe for unlimited access to its\nresearch and recommendations. New York Times All Access digital\nand home delivery subscribers will continue to receive unlimited\naccess to Wirecutter’s 1,200+ product reviews, deals coverage and\nother guides to help them shop confidently online with their\nexisting subscription. A standalone subscription to Wirecutter is\navailable for $5 every four weeks or $40 annually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes sense, and in my opinion, the Times’s paywall rules are among the best in the industry, in terms of offering a generous number of free reads to non-subscribers. But it’s one less “free for everyone to read” high-quality site.</p>\n\n<p>(I have <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/wirecutter\">always enjoyed Wirecutter</a>, going back to when they debuted (and had a leading <em>The</em>), but I wish they had a rival that focused less on price. Wirecutter recommendations are very often skewed to the best low-priced product, not the best product in a category, period. I want domain experts to tell me the best products — I can make up my own mind on how much I want to spend.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/03/wirecutter-paywall\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5d1b72e4fd00b9e070850121f254e9c2ec8c2a3ca69f44077e6627f001123f2d","category":"Tech"}
