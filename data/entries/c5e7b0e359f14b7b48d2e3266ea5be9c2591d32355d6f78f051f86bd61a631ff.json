Apple's decision to switch to a new design was mainly driven by the need to accommodate a third camera in the form of a new Ultra Wide camera, along with improved sensors and optics. The introduction of the new camera bump set a new aesthetic standard for subsequent models, influencing the design of later releases right up to today's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRegardless, it looks like the design of the ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro is set to change considerably. Late last month, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">claimed</a> that the rear of the ‌‌iPhone 17‌‌ Pro and ‌‌iPhone 17‌‌ Pro Max will feature a \"rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass,\" while the bottom half will continue to be made of glass to support wireless charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a mixed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">track record for Apple rumors</a>, but has provided some strikingly accurate information, such as the imminent launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">2023's Yellow iPhone 14</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/\">frosted back glass</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, the Apple Watch Series 9 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/\">as a minor refresh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/\">spatial video capture</a> on the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro, the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/\">landscape front-facing camera</a>, the M4 ‌iPad Pro‌'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/\">nano-texture display option</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-16-pro-battery-capacities/\">battery capacities</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/\">continued Apple Watch band compatibility</a> through the Apple Watch Series 10.
