And then soon after of seeing them hucked of the biggest cliffs in the early days of freeride. They are an undeniably iconic wheelset as mountain biking rapidly progressed to riding and racing much more technical terrain. And many of gravity mountain biking’s biggest names rode DeeMaxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Mavic DeeMax DH YLW, Ltd. ed. yellow downhill freeride gravity mountain bike wheels, history\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-297x99.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-800x267.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-120x40.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-768x256.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-1536x512.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary_evolution-2048x683.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>DeeMax DH evolution history</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not entirely sure how Mavic does their 25th Anniversary DeeMax math, as the wheels technically debut on the DH World Cup in 1995 as a prototype tubeless alloy rim wrapped in an aero carbon shroud developed together with Michelin. Mavic says two seasons later though, Nicolas Vouilloz was winning World Cups and a World Championship already on the first yellow DeeMax wheels that then seared themselves into our brains. Still that’s 26 years ago. Maybe a little lull in the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=mavic\" target=\"_blank\">Mavic</a> business in recent years justified holding out on giving us new yellow DeeMaxes. But now, we have them. And we’re kinda psyched.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what’s actually new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In development for years, the big changes are in the all-new DeeMax DH rim…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Mavic DeeMax DH 25th Anniversary Limited Edition Yellow iconic gravity MTB wheels, photo by G Chenard, Commencal Supreme DH bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_Commencal-Supreme-DH-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still Maxtal S6000 alloy, welded, and still tubeless.

That’s not any wider than we see even with some XC wheels these days, but it’s still a sweet spot to supporting the 2.5″ tires that dominate modern gravity racing (rated for 2-3″ tires). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is also a 2x wider well in the middle of the rim cavity to make tire installs easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_tubeless-rim-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_tubeless-rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Mavic DeeMax DH 25th Anniversary Limited Edition Yellow iconic gravity MTB wheels, photo by G Chenard, UST tubeless rim detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_tubeless-rim-detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_tubeless-rim-detail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_tubeless-rim-detail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_tubeless-rim-detail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_tubeless-rim-detail-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What is really interesting in that profile is the return of hooks, which Mavic assures us is to improve impact protection and reduce sidewall pinch flats. The overall asymmetric rim profile is also now more triangular (rather than a semi-circle curve) to better handle high impact forces. Plus, thicker shoulders at the base of the rim sidewall to minimize local bending on impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs.jpg\" alt=\"Mavic DeeMax DH 25th Anniversary Limited Edition Yellow iconic gravity MTB wheels, photo by G Chenard, hub detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mavic-DeeMax-DH-25th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Yellow-downhill-freeride-gravity-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-G-Chenard_alloy-hubs-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new DeeMax DH wheels are built with 28 double-butted bladed j-bend spokes and steel nipples laced 3x front &amp; rear for lightweight and durability.
