For example, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234483/27-inch-apple-imac-2020-review.html\">2020 iMac</a> started at $1,799 for 256GB of storage and $1,999 for 512GB of storage. And that machine came with a 10th-gen 3.1 GHz Core i5 processor, which is a far cry from the M2 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as what you’re getting, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Studio Display</a> is essentially an iMac display with 5K resolution, a 12MP camera with Center Stage, six speakers with spatial audio support, and Two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports. On the Mac side, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480091/mac-mini-m2-pro-review.html\">Mac mini</a> has a powerful M2 processor with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Gigabit Ethernet, and a headphone jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a tiny footprint, the iMac can be tucked away just like a real iMac. So if the 24-inch iMac is too small for you, build your own while the price is lower than ever.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a6704ed924a73db1be8f4bb5aaab9843f39f51101ddc42e9674162bc9599bfb2","category":"Apple"}
