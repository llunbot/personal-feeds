The term, meaning “One team” in the Swahili language widely spoken in East Africa, conveys the idea that in the drive for greater inclusivity in cycling, success for one East African cyclist, team or race organisation means success for all. Brooks identifies with the spirit of the Migration Gravel Race, and by purchasing this limited edition saddle customers can directly support the Maasai in their effort to maintain their beautiful cultural practices as well as the AMANI project in their laudable goal of making the sport of cycling more accessible to athletes from East Africa.\r\n\r\nFollowing MGR2021, AMANI seeks to create cycling opportunities for the Maasai in particular through rider sponsorships and, along with professional Kenyan riders, host a series of workshops at local schools where the riders can talk about how they came to be professional cyclists and encourage kids to take up cycling.\r\n\r\nThe Migration Cambium features a colourful design inspired by the event and comes in a special set including a beautiful beaded saddle charm handmade by local Maasai craftspeople, with no two charms exactly alike. Along with this, each set comes with documentary film photo prints from the inaugural 2021 event.\r\n\r\nThe Brooks England C17 Migration Gravel Saddle is available now in extremely limited quantities on the Brooks <a href=\"https://www.brooksengland.com/c17-migration-gravel-race.html\">website</a>. <h2>Key Details</h2><ul><li>Brooks England have released a limited-edition Cambium gravel saddle to celebrate the Migration Gravel Race, East Africa’s first such event.</li><li>A portion of sales from each saddle goes to support the Amani Project, an initiative aimed at establishing more equitable racing opportunities for East African cyclists. </li><li>Just 50 pieces available. </li></ul><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/c17-fupta06401_c17_nylon__multi-colour_top.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/c17-fupta06401_c17_nylon__multi-colour_detail1.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/c17-fupta06400_c17_nylon__multi-colour_detail2.png\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/c17-fupta06400_c17_nylon__multi-colour_3-4.jpg\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/brooks-england-launch-special-saddle-to-support-east-african-cycling/\">Read More</a>","author":"Brooks England","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"eeeebc4c13c9e26fdcb250cea0489bf3ebeed3a9f07d13e142799c2c2a6fd107","category":"Cycling"}
