The launch took place on Christmas Day when an R-7 rocket lifted off, carrying a remote-sensing satellite from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</p>\n<p>This family of rockets has an incredible heritage dating back nearly six decades. The first R-7 vehicle was designed by the legendary Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev. It flew in 1957 and was the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile. Because the first Soviet nuclear warheads were massive, the R-7 vehicle was powerful enough to be converted into an orbital rocket.</p>\n<p>A modified version of the R-7 rocket, therefore, launched the Sputnik satellite later in 1957. And the slightly more powerful \"Vostok\" version of the booster carried Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, opening the era of human spaceflight. The first Soyuz variant, a rocket that has been upgraded multiple times but remains similar to its original form, flew in 1966. Humans still fly on the Soyuz rocket today to the International Space Station.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/russia-just-launched-the-2000th-semyorka-rocket-its-both-a-triumph-and-tragedy/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/russia-just-launched-the-2000th-semyorka-rocket-its-both-a-triumph-and-tragedy/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d26abf97085253267539b7a97d72daee9a431a674d56db9e1b2bd7a725e49e4b","category":"Tech"}
