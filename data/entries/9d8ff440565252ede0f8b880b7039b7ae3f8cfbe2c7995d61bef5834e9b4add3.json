So <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q3PMQ2\" target=\"_blank\">Prime Video</a> released the first full trailer for the show's second season today, and it's full of the eye-popping visuals we've come to expect from this lavish adaptation of Robert Jordan's series of fantasy novels.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first season below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/we-have-our-first-look-at-images-from-amazons-new-wheel-of-time-series/\">I've written previously</a>, the series centers on Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), a member of a powerful, all-woman organization called the Aes Sedai. Magic, known as the One Power, is divided into male (<em>saidin</em>) and female (<em>saidar</em>) flavors. The latter is the province of the Aes Sedai. Long ago, a great evil called the Dark One caused the <em>saidin</em> to become tainted, such that most men who show an ability to channel that magic go mad. It's the job of the Aes Sedai to track down such men and strip them of their powers. There is also an ancient prophecy concerning the Dragon Reborn: the reincarnation of a person who will save or destroy humanity. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954570#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954570&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9d8ff440565252ede0f8b880b7039b7ae3f8cfbe2c7995d61bef5834e9b4add3","category":"Tech"}
