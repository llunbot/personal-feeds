Soon after the store listing slip-up, The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch\">cited</a> \"a source familiar with Microsoft's plans\" to confirm that the release date was accurate.</p>\n<p>On that date, the game will arrive as a split package. One half is a standard retail-priced \"campaign\" for the first-person series, in which Master Chief teams up with a hapless outer-space survivor and a memory-wiped version of the popular AI character Cortana to land on a wide-open planet and contend with the series' first \"open-world\" arrangement of levels. The other half is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/halo-infinite-multiplayer-news-bots-split-screen-free-to-play-clarified/\">an entirely free-to-play versus-multiplayer suite</a> of modes, which will be supported by a paid \"battle pass\" system that developer 343 Industries has described as made up entirely of cosmetic add-ons, with all modes and levels being free for all players. It's currently unclear whether the paid retail version of the campaign will include any bonuses, cosmetic or otherwise, for use in the free-to-play multiplayer suite.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789729#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789729&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2307a78a62e9884a7319425d87790a049b572a54bea36c355db10e01cc1eeb4f","category":"Tech"}
