Hascoët resigned from the company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/ubisofts-most-powerful-creative-force-resigns-in-wake-of-sweeping-allegations/\">in July 2020</a>, while Francois <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tommy-fran-ois-has-left-ubisoft\">left less than a month later</a>. A year after those departures, French labor union Solidaires Informatique worked with two of the alleged victims to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SolInfoJeuVideo/status/1415963201703919617\">file a formal complaint</a> about the alleged assaults, which seems to have led to this week's move by French police.</p>\n<p>It's not immediately clear who else has been caught up in this week's police actions or whether the former executives will be released from detention after questioning. Other high-profile Ubisoft employees who resigned or were fired amid the 2020 allegations include <em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em> director Ashraf Ismail, former Ubisoft Canada managing director Yannis Mallat; former Ubisoft PR director Stone Chin; former Ubisoft global head of HR Cécile Cornet, and former Ubisoft vice president of editorial Maxime Beland.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973247#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973247&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7317d079e07367e40b60eb0323dacf2c8c3226dae394a38335b99a198f42031","category":"Tech"}
