Not extremely lightweight, but paired with geometry that sits between endurance road &amp; race gravel, Wilier sees this as a top-tier mixed-surface all-rounder.</p><p>The Rave SLR will be offered in six frame sizes (XS-XXL). It&nbsp;is&nbsp;built around a 71° head angle, ~74° seattube, and chainstays that vary from 421-427mm depending on size.
