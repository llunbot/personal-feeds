Now, Google and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have had their say in the remedy phase of the trial, which wraps up today. It will determine the consequences for Google's actions, potentially changing the landscape for search as we rocket into the AI era, whether we like it or not.</p>\n<p>The remedy trial featured over 20 witnesses, including representatives from some of the most important technology firms in the world. Their statements about the past, present, and future of search moved markets, but what does the testimony mean for Google?</p>\n<h2>Everybody wants Chrome</h2>\n<p>One of the DOJ's proposed remedies is to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/\">force Google to divest Chrome</a> and the open source Chromium project. Google has been adamant both in and out of the courtroom that it is the only company that can properly run Chrome.

And regardless, Google Chrome would be too expensive for anyone to buy.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c8ffcc4919a30be5960ec1481f88ba388ff9c93a614d9ef60ff311bbc9876cbd","category":"Tech"}
