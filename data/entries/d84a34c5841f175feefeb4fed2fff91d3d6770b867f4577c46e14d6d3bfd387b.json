The mixture of dyes at each spot encodes information that is then read with a fluorescent microscope. </p></div>\n<p>Optical disks, flash drives, and magnetic hard disk drives can only store digital information for a few decades, and they tend to require a lot of energy to maintain, making these methods less than ideal for long-term data storage. So researchers have been looking into using molecules as alternatives, most notably in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/dna-data-storage-gets-random-access/\">DNA data storage</a>. Those methods come with their own challenges, however, including high synthesis costs and slow read and write rates.</p>\n<p>Now, Harvard University scientists have figured out how to use fluorescent dyes as bits for a cheaper, faster means of data storage, according to <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1021/acscentsci.1c00728&amp;ref=pdf\">a new paper</a> published in the journal ACS Central Science. The researchers tested their method by storing one of 19th-century physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday\">Michael Faraday</a>'s seminal papers on electromagnetism and chemistry, as well as a JPEG image of Faraday.</p>\n<p>\"This method could provide access to archival data storage at a low cost,\" <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/10/harvard-researchers-use-dyes-to-store-data/\">said co-author Amit A. Nagarkar</a>, who conducted the research as a postdoctoral fellow in George Whitesides' Harvard lab. “[It] provides access to long-term data storage using existing commercial technologies—inkjet printing and fluorescence microscopy.” Nagarkar is now working for a startup company that wants to commercialize the method.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804233#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804233&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d84a34c5841f175feefeb4fed2fff91d3d6770b867f4577c46e14d6d3bfd387b","category":"Tech"}
