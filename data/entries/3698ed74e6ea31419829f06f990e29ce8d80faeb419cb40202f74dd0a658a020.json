This had been a security measure that, when failed on both sides, prevented any PS4 software, digital or physical, from playing at all. For anyone concerned about being able to play PS4 games (like, say, Hideo Kojima's terrifying <em>P.T.</em>, a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/signs-points-to-cancellation-for-kojimas-silent-hills/\">delisted proof-of-concept demo</a> for the cancelled <em>Silent Hills</em>) long after PSN support for the system has been shuttered, this is great news.</p>\n\n<h2>Connection problems</h2>\n<p>The problem is the PS4's CMOS battery, which fits into the hardware's motherboard and is used to internally track the date and time, even when there's no power. If that battery is removed for replacement or just dies, the system can't properly track the real-world calendar. This forces the PS4 to reconnect to PSN to establish the correct timeâ€”a routine check that happens every time you try to play a digital or physical game. So what happened, preupdate, if you had a dead-battery PS4 that isn't connected to the Internet? That time check with PSN couldn't be completed, meaning any games wouldn't play.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799507#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799507&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3698ed74e6ea31419829f06f990e29ce8d80faeb419cb40202f74dd0a658a020","category":"Tech"}
