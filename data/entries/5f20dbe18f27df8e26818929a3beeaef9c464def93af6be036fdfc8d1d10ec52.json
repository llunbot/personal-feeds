My guest today is former pro roadie Ian Boswell, and he definitely falls into that latter category, although he does have a few things coming up that you may want to check out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how he transitioned from racing full-time at the highest level to working a “9-5 gig” with Wahoo, and then he reveals not one but two different gravel events he’s part of, and an experimental bikepacking weekend that might turn into something much bigger.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel.jpg\" alt=\"ian boswell selfie while riding gravel bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ian-boswell-riding-gravel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ian_boswell/\" target=\"_blank\">Ian’s Instagram</a> to keep up with his latest adventures, and check out the <a href=\"https://bicibucerias.com/la-vuelta-de-jalisco-ian\" target=\"_blank\">Bici Bucerias Gravel Camp</a> in Mexico and his Peacham<a href=\"https://www.peachamfallfondo.com\" target=\"_blank\"> Fall Fondo</a> if you’d like to join him on a ride!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Want More?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find the BikeRumor Podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bikerumor-podcast/id1455519558\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bikerumor-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Podbean</a>, and through <a href=\"https://feed.podbean.com/bikerumor/feed.xml\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>, or wherever you listen to podcasts! Hit like, hit subscribe, and hit play!
