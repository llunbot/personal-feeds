They’re cut from a solid block of titanium and the machining here is seriously impressive.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s all entirely unnecessary, but if you’re looking for some bike jewellery for your ride, then you’ve got it here.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The cranks start out as a big ol’ block of titanium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The cranks weigh 530g, including the spindle, or 600g with 5DEV’s new titanium chainring. Both use an eight-bolt direct-mount design, compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">SRAM’s latest T-Type Transmission drivetrains</a>. SRAM switched to eight-bolt to offer compatibility with Quarq <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meters</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re not sure about the pricing for the cranks at the moment.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 5DEV also has titanium chainrings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The chainrings are available in 30t and 32t sizes, in a raw finish, bronze, purple or teal. If you’re paying for titanium chainrings, then you’ve got to choose the raw finish, haven’t you? Yours for $199.99.</p>\n<p>5DEV also offers a heavily machined titanium stem, with a 40mm option now available alongside the 32mm and 48mm versions. The stems fit 35mm bars, or 31.8mm bars with a shim (provided). Again, there are four finishes to choose from.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/Sea-Otter-MTB-day-one-12-3bce9b4.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"5Dev titanium stem at Sea Otter 2023\" title=\"5Dev titanium stem at Sea Otter 2023\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There are 32mm, 40mm and 48mm stem options.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>George Scott / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/Sea-Otter-MTB-day-one-11-7ca8ba0.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"5Dev titanium stem at Sea Otter 2023\" title=\"5Dev titanium stem at Sea Otter 2023\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Want a stem with a difference?<br /></span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>George Scott / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/Sea-Otter-MTB-day-one-13-7a2fc31.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Specialized Diverge STR gravel bike with 5Dev components at Sea Otter 2023\" title=\"Specialized Diverge STR gravel bike with 5Dev components at Sea Otter 2023\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>5DEV is also working on 70mm, 80mm and 90mm stems for gravel riding.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>George Scott / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The 5DEV Titanium Stem costs $399.99.</p>\n<p>The 48mm stem was fitted to a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-specialized-diverge-str/\">Specialized Diverge STR</a> gravel bike at Sea Otter.

And it is impressively light – a claimed 50g.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s designed for XC, downcountry and trail riding, according to Vittoria.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Two-time Olympic XC champion and five-time world champion, Julien Absalon, has been testing this for Vittoria, which gives you an idea of the type of riding the Air-Liner Light is aimed at.</p>\n<p>Whereas the existing Air-Liner MTB has a figure of 8 shape, flipped on its side, the Air-Liner Light has a diamond profile. This, Vittoria says, is designed to improve the stability of the tyre, particularly given the lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mtb-tyre-carcass-construction/\">tyre casings</a> this insert is most likely to be paired with.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Air-Liner Light comes (and must be used) with this multi-way tubeless valve.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This, in turn, is said to improve puncture protection and the suspension characteristics of the liner. “The unique foam of the Air-Liner Light provides a ‘limitless travel’ feeling to the tyre compression which increases comfort, grip, and speed,” according to Vittoria.</p>\n<p>Vittoria says the Air-Liner Light is designed to fit 29×2.1in to 29×2.4in tyres, on wheels with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">rim width</a> of 25-30mm.</p>\n<p>While we’re talking tyre inserts, CushCore launched the Trail insert at Sea Otter, designed to sit between its Pro and XC options.

There’s also a seven-speed version for downhill racing.</p>\n<p>With SRAM and Shimano continuing to focus on high-end <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a>, could TRP provide an alternative for mountain bikers who want the tactile feel – and lower cost – of cables? We’ve got an EVO12 en-route to BikeRadar HQ for review so will find out how it performs.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar, TRP – Tektro Racing Products – was founded in 2006 as the high-end components of Tektro, the brakes brand that makes millions of brakes each year. Therefore, this is a company with scale and expertise when it comes to manufacturing.</p>\n<p>EVO12 supersedes <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/derailleurs/derailleurs-rear/mountain-bike-derailleur-rear/trp-tr12-rear-derailleur-and-shifter-review/\">TRP’s TR12</a> rear derailleur and shifter kit. Here, we’ve got a complete drivetrain, with TRP making almost everything in-house, including the crankset and cassette. The chain comes from KMC.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> TRP had to produce a cassette to complete the drivetrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The new cassette is a two-piece design, with a 10-52t range (10-11-13-15-18-21-24-28-32-36-44-52).</p>\n<p>The bottom 10 sprockets are made from steel, for improved durability, while the two largest sprockets are made from aluminium, to reduce weight. The cassette is compatible with Microspline <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehubs</a>, but not XD drivers.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Taiwanese brand now has cranks, too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The carbon crankset is also new and is available in 165mm and 170mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/what-is-the-best-crank-length-for-cycling/\">crank lengths</a>, spinning on a 30mm aluminium axle. There’s a forged aluminium version, too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> TRP says the shifter ergonomics have been improved, compared to the old TR12 drivetrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Elsewhere, TRP says the shifter ergonomics have been improved, with a lighter lever action compared to TR12. It’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/sram-matchmaker-x/\">Matchmaker compatible</a>. One of the neat features here is the option to toggle the shifter between one upshift per click or five, using a small switch on the underside of the unit.</p>\n<p>As for the rear derailleur, Tektro says it now shifts on a horizontal parallelogram, compared to the more angular actuation of the TR12 derailleur, and it’s a stiffer design.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear derailleur’s Hall Lock (the gold lever) secures the B-knuckle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>TRP’s Hall Lock feature remains. It’s effectively an on/off lever that, when ‘on’, locks the B-knuckle in place to secure the derailleur body, and reduce chain movement and drivetrain noise. The Hall Lock can be turned off to remove the rear wheel. There’s also a clutch.</p>\n<p>Finally, before we get on to pricing, all EVO12 components are available in the gold-black finish pictured, as well as an all-black option.</p>\n<h3>TRP EVO12 pricing</h3>\n<ul><li>TRP EVO12 rear derailleur – $229.99-$239.99</li>\n<li>TRP EVO12 shifter – $99.99-$109.99</li>\n<li>TRP EVO12 carbon crankset – $349.99</li>\n<li>TRP EVO 12 aluminium crankset – $149.99</li>\n<li>TRP EVO12 chainring – $74.99-$79.99</li>\n<li>TRP EVO12 cassette – $398.92</li>\n</ul><h2>Turner Scrub, a titanium “aggro-enduro” hardtail</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Turner Scrub is an “aggro-enduro” titanium hardtail.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Turner is well-known for its titanium mountain bikes and the Scrub, an “aggro-enduro hardtail”, is the California-based brand’s latest model.</p>\n<p>The Scrub has had the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/spoke-tension-is-long-slack-and-low-geometry-always-better-our-tech-experts-give-us-their-angle/\">low, long and slack</a> treatment, getting a 64.5-degree head angle, a 76-degree seat angle, 435mm chainstays, and 440mm and 465mm of reach for the Regular and Tall sizes respectively.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Turner has been making titanium bikes since 1994.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“The wheelbase is plenty long so when going full gas down bombed-out enduro runs, the Scrub will provide plenty of security,” adds Turner.</p>\n<p>The frame is designed to be built around a 150-160mm fork, while the top tube is intentionally low to boost standover heigh and increase seatpost insertion, to 280mm in the Regular size and 320mm in the Tall size.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The low-slung top tube features plenty of reinforcement.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Turner says the frame’s tubes have been “beefed up” to withstand the hard riding the Scrub is designed for, and there are also gussets in high-stress areas.
