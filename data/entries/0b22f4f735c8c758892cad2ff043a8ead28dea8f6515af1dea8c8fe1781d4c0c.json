It’s a step up in its provision to pro racers for the Utah-based brand, which only started to offer complete bikes in 2021 with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/enve-launches-its-first-complete-road-bike-the-custom-road\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Road</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enve says that it’s developed the Melee to work with its components as an integrated whole and that it has aero optimised the bike for ride speeds between 32 and 40kmh, which sounds a little slow by pro team standards. The aerodynamics work best with tyres between 27mm and 32mm wide though, which sounds more in range for road racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"585\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-970x585.jpg\" alt=\"TotalEnergies Enve Melee\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-970x585.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-300x181.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-768x463.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-1536x926.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-2048x1234.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-750x452.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO47-1140x687.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Enve</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Enve has had a niche in performance wheels for years, but it has broadened its scope into other components as well as complete bikes. As you’d expect, TotalEnergies’ bikes are kitted out with a range of other Enve parts. It will supply the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/enve-updates-ses-wheelset-range\" target=\"_blank\">SES 2.3, 3.4, 4.5 and 6.7 wheelsets</a> to the team, as well as a choice of its SES Aero Road Bar which comes in 400mm to 460mm widths and SES AR Bar, which is available in widths from 380mm up to 460mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enve reckons that it’s a good opportunity to promote its brand, Enve’s general manager Mike Stimola says, ‘Having the opportunity to partner with TotalEnergies, a team with so much history in the sport, is an honour for us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve earned a reputation as the leader in wheel and component technology, and to now add Enve bicycles to the professional peloton with TotalEnergies is an important step as a performance brand. We are always proud to see our products used at the highest level of the sport, in the biggest races, and this collaboration will allow us to introduce Enve bicycles to a far-reaching audience.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/specialized-tarmac-sl8-vs-sl7\">Specialized Tarmac SL8 vs. Tarmac SL7: Every difference compared</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the Tour de France team sponsors?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/enve-mog-review\">Enve MOG review: First ride on new premium US gravel bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-greenwashing-cycling\">What is greenwashing and how does it impact cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Enve Melee bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/enve_melee_review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a second recent bike swap for TotalEnergies. Until Peter Sagan <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/peter-sagan-sidekicks-specialized-and-sportful-sign-with-team-totalenergies\" target=\"_blank\">joined the team</a> in 2022, they were riding Wilier bikes, but Sagan brought with him his longtime bike sponsor Specialized and its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl7-review-end-of-the-venge\" target=\"_blank\">Tarmac SL7</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/peter-sagan\" target=\"_blank\">Sagan’s retirement</a>, that link to Specialized, which already has two men’s WorldTour teams riding its bikes (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Bora-Hansgrohe</a>), has clearly been broken, allowing Enve to step in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enve SES wheels will also continue to be raced by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>, as well as Team Polti-Kometa, the team jointly managed by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/alberto-contador\" target=\"_blank\">Alberto Contador</a> and Ivan Basso and recently renamed from Eolo-Kometa following a freshly announced change of title sponsors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Cyclist tech editor Sam Challis reviewed the Enve Melee in February this year, he said it was ‘one of the best bikes in its class, with a touch of added practicality’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That practicality comes from clearance for 35m tyres, which could be handy for TotalEnergies if it is invited to ride cobbled races such as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/paris-roubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix</a> next year, as it was in 2023. There’s also the option to fit mudguards which the team seems unlikely to need. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our test bike weighed 7.2kg in size 56cm, so the Melee is competitively lightweight. Enve doesn’t yet produce a time-trial bike, so the team will continue to ride Specialized Shiv TT bikes for the time being.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the Enve Melee frameset now from <a href=\"https://saddleback.avln.me/c/MWpgkhHlTuJp\" target=\"_blank\">Saddleback (£5,500)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out Tadej Pogačar’s 2023 Enve-equipped <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-bike-2\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago V4Rs</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/enve-totalenergies\">Enve will supply bikes for TotalEnergies next season</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0b22f4f735c8c758892cad2ff043a8ead28dea8f6515af1dea8c8fe1781d4c0c","category":"Cycling"}
