The device dominated the UK and other European territories in the early 1980s. This computer was a major processing step up from black-and-white Spectrum computers like ZX80 and ZX81, and it debuted in a configuration priced as low as £125. American readers probably best know this platform thanks to popular and ambitious ZX Spectrum games from the little developer Ultimate: Play The Game.

A BBC documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fhNbcJXKO8\">Clive Sinclair: The Pace Setters</a>,</em> chronicles the inventor's rise, which began with him selling one-at-a-time radio kits via mail order in the 1960s.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796244#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"72575a78758673ad9d3174fb903615e98447b5acd03828448ab140f94134b4e7","category":"Tech"}
