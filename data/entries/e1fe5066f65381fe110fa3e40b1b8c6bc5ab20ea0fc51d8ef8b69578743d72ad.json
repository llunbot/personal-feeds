However, T8132\nis not the identifier for the M3 chip which is T8122.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, based on the pattern that the M series chips have been\nfollowing, it seems like it’s the M4 chip.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was exactly right. It was also two weeks before Mark Gurman’s “I’m hearing there is a strong possibility that the chip in the new iPad Pro will be the M4, not the M3” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-28/apple-rivals-retool-to-compete-with-iphone-and-vision-pro-ios-18-and-ai-details-lvjhucsv\">eye-opener in his Power On column</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/m4-ipad-pro-sleuth\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e1fe5066f65381fe110fa3e40b1b8c6bc5ab20ea0fc51d8ef8b69578743d72ad","category":"Tech"}
