Battery health information can be found by opening the System Settings app and clicking on Battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211832\">support document</a>, Apple explains how the battery health management feature works:<blockquote>Battery health management is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and its charging patterns.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBased on the measurements that it collects, battery health management may temporarily reduce your battery's maximum charge. This happens as needed to ensure that your battery charges to a level that's optimized for your usageâ€”reducing wear on the battery, and slowing its chemical aging.</blockquote>macOS Sonoma is set to be released today following over three months of beta testing, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/24/macos-sonoma-launch-date-and-features/\">key new features</a> including interactive desktop widgets, a Game Mode, the ability to add websites to the Dock as web apps, several Safari improvements, and more.
