Like many of the WorldTour’s backroom staff, in a former life the Swede was in the spotlight himself during a respectable racing career. He won his national championships in 1993 – a race won by Paris-Roubaix winner Magnus Backstedt in 2007 – and was on the precipice of riding onto the global stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But life conspired for a different outcome, and although still chiselled and youthful-looking – only the creases in his forehead give away his 55 years – Johansson finds himself at his ninth Tour de France as a mechanic, wrench in oil-stained hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102039/pro_tour_mechanics_02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_02\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve been a mechanic since 2009. I started with women’s teams and the national team before moving to the WorldTour and Garmin [now EF Education-EasyPost]. I then worked for Vacansoleil-DCM until they disbanded in 2013. It was then onto MTN-Qhubeka, which became Dimension Data, for six years before they closed. Then I spent a season with Israel Start-Up Nation, and now we are here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As a rider I had a contract offer to turn professional, but I didn’t take it. I regret that to this day,’ he adds in a way that makes it clear he’s only half joking.<b></b></p>\n\n\n\n<p><i>Cyclist</i> has caught up with Johansson on the Tour’s sweltering second rest day near Châtel in the Alps, albeit in his case ‘rest day’ is a little euphemistic. His schedule is equally as busy as on race day, with the only real difference that Johansson finds himself manacled to the team truck instead of wedged into the team car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Whether it’s a rest day or a stage, I’ll wake up between six and eight. I’ll have 45 minutes to myself so I have a coffee – I make a decent mocha – and enjoy some me time. It’s generally the only sane moment I have in the day. I’ll then head down to the lobby and drop my suitcase off for the next hotel transfer and then have breakfast.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102042/pro_tour_mechanics_03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_03\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the team’s riders, whose breakfast tables groan under jugs of nitrate-rich beetroot juice and three-egg omelettes, Johansson explains he eats ‘shitloads of bread and croissants from the hotel, usually doused in some poor marmalade, then a baguette in the team car.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That should tell you something about the time and energy commitment of a WorldTour mechanic. ‘It’s the same for 20-plus days. It’s a good job I’m not gluten-intolerant.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such grab-and-go is hardly the breakfast of champions, agrees Risto Usin, head mechanic at Bora-Hansgrohe. ‘But I don’t mind the ham and cheese,’ the Estonian smiles. At 38, Usin is 17 years Johansson’s junior but has been a pro-rider’s best friend for ten. Likewise, he also raced to a high standard, but banished thoughts of going full-time in his early twenties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that, he was determined to stay in the sport. ‘After working for the national team and going freelance, I was introduced to Ralph [Denk, Bora-Hansgrohe manager] in 2012 and, unusually, I’ve been with the team ever since.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pippa-york\">Being Pippa: Pippa York profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2><b>When the day comes</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102044/pro_tour_mechanics_04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_04\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between them the two mechanics have racked up 23 years’ experience, and it shows in the effortless and meticulous way they work with their respective bikes – Johansson poring over a Ridley Noah, Usin fettling with an S-Works Tarmac. Given it’s a rest day, today is all about checking, cleaning, charging and pumping. It’s similar to race day but not <i>quite</i> as frenetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘On a Tour stage we have four cars and each rider has two spare bikes. During the stage the two DS cars will each have eight bikes clamped to the roof-racks, and a mechanic on the back seat. One of these cars often follows the breakaway with the other following the main bunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/clickable_subs_promo2.jpg\" alt=\"click to subscribe\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That’s during the stage. Before the start the other two cars take the race bikes  and soigneurs from the hotel to the start. They’ll have four bikes on each. They’ll give the bikes to their riders before heading to the feedzones.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The feedzones show cycling in all its craziness, where a soigneur is standing there waving a wheel,’ Johansson adds. ‘It might be useful for Roubaix or a gravelly course, but it is rather pointless at a stage race feedzone.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102047/pro_tour_mechanics_05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_05\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Roubaix is my favourite race,’ says Usin. ‘There’s so much preparation. You have recons, where you’re playing around with tyre pressures; you triple-check every bolt and go into micro-detail; and, if the rider wants it, you add more bar tape, although we have the [S-Works] Roubaix with its suspension system, so it’s not really needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The whole Roubaix experience would be almost ethereal if it wasn’t so stressful.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><b>Following the circus</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102050/pro_tour_mechanics_06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_06\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><i>Cyclist </i>has racked up hundreds of kilometres shadowing riders in team cars as the DS drives over Alpine passes like they’re on a Scalextric track, with only a sick bag and a concrete barrier between life and certain death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you need further proof of just how wild pro-race car driving can be, UAE Team ADQ’s Mavi Garcia had her Tour de France Femmes ambitions ended when her own team car knocked her rear wheel, sending her spinning, while Team BikeExchange sports director Gene Bates was booted out off the 2021 Giro d’Italia after hitting QuickStep’s Pieter Serry. Our mechanics, however, remain unfazed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I can honestly say our DSes are pretty good drivers,’ Usin says diplomatically. ‘Mind you, there are some guys who can’t handle the driving that well. I’ve known support staff to throw up in the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You spend a lot of time in cars. It can become boring at times, and sometimes you’ll sneak in a small nap. Not on mountain stages, of course, which can be full-on from the start. I like to call that kind of nap a ‘professional sleep’, as you sleep with one eye and one ear open. You can still hear the radio and you’re always ready to react to a crash.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102052/pro_tour_mechanics_07-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_07\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Usin says so far this year’s Tour has been relatively uneventful, with Bora’s GC hopeful Aleksandr Vlasov’s crash on Stage 6 the standout moment. Vlasov remounted without severe damage to either body or bike (and would later finish fifth overall). There were also a couple of flats each day the Tour weaved its way across Denmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Johansson, he’s similarly assassin-like, with his own quasi-kipping hiding a readiness to explode. ‘You must still be alert,’ he says. ‘That’s part of the job. It also helps if you have a little language knowledge. You don’t need to be fluent but it certainly helps if you can understand the race situations that come over the radio in Spanish, Italian, French, Flemish or whatever.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polyglot or not, Johansson would experience a unique incident on Stage 13 when star sprinter Caleb Ewan crashed rounding a corner, followed by his teammates rather innocuously tumbling over the barriers. ‘Yes, that was a strange one,’ he tells us later. ‘Thankfully, the riders’ bikes were OK, as they were aero bikes and they can take much longer to repair than traditional bikes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><b>Check, check and check again</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102056/pro_tour_mechanics_08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_08\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the riders it’s called evolution, but for the mechanics, new bikes and kit can often feel like regression as they’re charged with mastering new maintenance techniques. While the advent of disc brakes, electronic groupsets and concealed cables has decreased a rider’s drag and boosted things like shifting, it has made a mechanic’s life harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It has certainly made the days longer and you have to work much smarter,’ says Johansson. ‘One of the key things is ensuring you cut those concealed cables to the right length. Fail to do that and it’s a right pain and often you have to start over.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a more positive and perhaps surprising note, the Swede welcomes tubeless tyres taking over from tubulars: ‘They’re far more practical, especially for recreational riders who don’t have a mechanic to hand. And you don’t need to glue them.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102058/pro_tour_mechanics_09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_09\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With his day’s work done, Johansson welcomes an early night – a rarity at the Tour. ‘Once a stage finishes the main aim is to collect the riders’ race bikes as quickly as possible. It takes a little longer if they need to cool down on a turbo after a hard stage, or if a rider comes in late – which has been happening often because of Caleb’s struggles [making the time cut] – or if they’re at doping control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We gather them up, clamp them back on a team car’s roof, then drive them to the team hotel or, more specifically, to the team truck that’s waiting at the hotel.’ But it doesn’t end there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The first job is washing, so it’s bike up on the stand, degrease the drivetrain and rinse, wash the bike and rinse again before giving it to another mechanic to check. We make sure the mech hanger is straight, that the shifting is smooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We check and recharge the batteries in the groupset and the power meters. We check the tyres, rims, discs and bolts, tightening by feel or with a torque wrench. Obviously if someone’s been knocked in the peloton you’ll pay even closer attention. You’ll also make any changes for the rider’s next stage, such as the cassette or bar tape.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><b>The tinkerers</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102101/pro_tour_mechanics_10-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_10\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We have riders who won’t change their position all season. Then there are others who might appear at the truck after a stage and ask if you can change this, that or the other,’ says Usin. Bike-fitter and former Team Sky physiotherapist Phil Burt called these riders either macro absorbers or micro adjustors, but Usin has his own categorisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You have the Classics riders, who once they know everything works just crack on and don’t whine about much. Then you have the climbers, who can be rather snappy about the smallest of things – things that don’t actually affect anything but you make the change anyway.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tinkering habit is a topic Johansson is fascinated by. ‘There are certainly riders, whether they’re new to the WorldTour or have been racing for 15 years, who are all about a millimetre here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102105/pro_tour_mechanics_11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_11\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They might ask for something that you know isn’t worth doing – like tightening a lever bolt – so when they look away, you make a banging noise. You haven’t changed anything, but you ask them if it’s better and they say yes. It’s all in the head; in fact, I’d say cycling is 85% mental and 15% physical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Then again, I also find it a little odd when a rider doesn’t touch their bike for an entire Tour. As you fatigue it’s natural to lower your seatpost a little to relieve the aches and pains below the knee. But some really don’t want to change even this.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the rationale, the extent of these adjustments dictates whether the likes of Johansson and Usin finish at 8pm, 10pm or later still. Either way, it’s then dinner, maybe a beer or two (although that would be ‘informally’ at Lotto Soudal, who have had a no-alcohol staff policy for several years now), and then bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><b>The soldiers</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03102108/pro_tour_mechanics_12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pro_tour_mechanics_12\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As with breakfast, the personal touches when it comes to accommodation are reserved for the riders, who enjoy customised mattress toppers and air-conditioning units while the mechanics will just be given a swipe card and bidden <i>bonne nuit</i>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sleep is still taken seriously, says Usin, which is why you pair up with someone whose circadian rhythms match yours. ‘It tends to be a mechanic and soigneur in the same room, and it’s vital that you have roughly the same sleep routine, especially in the final week when you’re all tired. But it never hurts to have earplugs.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how things have panned out, the day is done anything up to 20 hours after it began, and then it’s sleep and Groundhog Day – back to the same relentless schedule that demands a certain cycling trait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve met a lot of interesting people in my career,’ says Johansson. ‘You have Ryder Hesjedal, who just wanted to build bikes; there was Johnny Hoogerland, the rider who flew into that barbed wire – he was a tremendous personality; and Mark Cavendish – he never went unnoticed, for good and bad. This is a tough sport and, in many ways, you have to be a bit damaged to survive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s the same with mechanics. It’s hard – damn hard – but for whatever reason, we love it. You have to.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-mechanics\">On the road with the Tour de France mechanics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"770446cefa35aa9968c22af3d428370286d632fc7dc8b5209107157447c531f2","category":"Cycling"}
