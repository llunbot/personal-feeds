A rumor in May <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/14/price-hike-coming-to-iphone-15-pro/\">claimed</a> that since the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus will gain a number of features currently exclusive to the Pro models, such as Dynamic Island and the 48-megapixel camera, Apple sees even more of a need to separate the Pro and non-Pro devices in terms of pricing this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe price increase was also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/iphone-15-pro-price-increase-rumor/\">predicted</a> in March by Jeff Pu, a tech analyst at Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max start at $999 and $1,099, meaning that any price increase would put both high-end iPhone models north of $1,000 for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the ‌iPhone 15‌ series in September, although supplies for the Pro models could be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/iphone-15-pro-display-manufacturing-issues/\">constrained</a>. All four devices are rumored to feature a USB-C port, the Dynamic Island, and a slightly more curved frame, while several additional features and changes are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/iphone-15-pro-top-five-rumored-features/\">rumored</a> for the Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is asking suppliers to produce about 85 million units of the iPhone 15 this year, which is roughly in line with the year before, according <em>Bloomberg</em>'s report.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-price-hike-iphone-15-pro-models/\">Bloomberg: Apple Considering Price Hike for iPhone 15 Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-apple-considering-price-hike-for-iphone-15-pro-models.2396726/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40a694974cae1e7db5b251df4dcaa7d68a744ecfe37b86a350341f6471e861b9","category":"Apple"}
