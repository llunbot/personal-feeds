The Apple Watch Series 10 launched two years later in 2024. The ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is designed to be a low-cost option that still offers many of the Apple Watch features that have made the device so popular over the years, while the Apple Watch Series 10 offers a more feature-rich experience with additional health monitoring capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ and the Apple Watch Series 10 feature Crash Detection, water resistance, an optical heart sensor, up to 18 hours of battery life, and more, but there are significant differences between the two devices.

Yet compared to the ‌Apple Watch SE‌, the Apple Watch Series 10 is a considerably more feature-rich device with advanced capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith its larger display, additional health monitoring features, and range of colors and finishes, the Apple Watch Series 10 will be the model of choice for those who want more out of their smartwatch. If you feel that the always-on display, added health monitoring features (such as ECG and sleep apnea notifications), or fast charging would be particularly useful to you, or simply like a specific casing and color combination not available with the ‌Apple Watch SE‌, the Apple Watch Series 10 will be the best model for you. It's also worth noting that the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is now over two years old, while the Series 10 has only just come out, so the latter is likely to be more future proof.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you are on a budget and are not particularly attracted to the additional features of the Series 10, the ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is still a compelling option. As it shares many key features with the Apple Watch Series 10, many customers will be happy choosing the more inexpensive model, unless you particularly value features such as the larger, always-on display or advanced health monitoring and can justify the added cost. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Watch SE‌ is an ideal device for kids and senior citizens who do not have an ‌iPhone‌ thanks to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/family-setup/\">Family Setup</a>, but it is also the go-to model for most customers who are new to the Apple Watch and those who are upgrading from a Series 4 or older due to its competitive pricing and generous feature set, allowing users to get a balanced Apple Watch experience at a low price.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-se-vs-series-10/\">Apple Watch SE vs. Apple Watch Series 10 Buyer's Guide</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-se-vs-apple-watch-series-10-buyers-guide.2439715/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b80c3e843e55c80f614d3e082d25b9c08c8f92c5c7176b41ca3bc326a8c829c","category":"Apple"}
