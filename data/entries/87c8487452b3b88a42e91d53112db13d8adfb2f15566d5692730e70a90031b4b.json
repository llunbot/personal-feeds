With standard and wide sizing, it’s easy to see why Lake’s shoes are often admired by bike-fitters, and these boots proved to be very comfortable even during long winter rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lake-cx146-winter-road-cycling-boots-review\" target=\"_blank\">Lake CX 146 winter road cycling boots review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Northwave Flagship R GTX winter road cycling shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Northwave Flagship R GTX winter road shoes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Northwave-Flagship-R-GTX-winter-road-shoes-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP:</strong> £386.99 / $472.99 / €429.99 </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Stiff carbon sole, warm, very comfortable</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Awkward to get on, heavy, expensive</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gore-Tex Duratherm Kelvin membrane for breathability, wind and waterproofing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>798g per pair (size 41)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Northwave’s top-tier winter road shoe, the new Flagship R GTX packs in plenty of features to its pricy, yet quite hefty package.

While overshoes are certainly a versatile and often cost-effective way to winterise your shoes, they often won’t be as windproof, warm or waterproof as a pair of winter-specific cycling shoes. Do we need to mention how much of a faff they can be to get on and off too, especially with cold fingers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like to keep riding outside through the harsher winter months and have the spare cash – and we’re likely talking several hundred here – then investing in a dedicated pair of winter cycling shoes can be a wise move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take care of them well, winter cycling shoes will probably last you at least a few years, too, whereas the durability of overshoes is often compromised as they can wear and rip on the soles of the shoes as you walk off the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I buy winter cycling shoes with road or MTB style cleats?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Tempo Artica GTX\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Fizik-Tempo-Artica-GTX-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like standard cycling shoes, you can also get winter cycling shoes with either road or MTB-style cleats and pedal compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice is largely down to personal preference; some riders will prefer to stick to a road-style three-bolt cleat, whereas others might prefer to go for a more durable metal two-bolt cleat for the winter. The latter style is usually recessed within the outsole, meaning you can more easily walk off the bike, a distinct advantage on wet and slippery winter floors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do be warned though: as off-road shoes often allow you to place the cleat further back, this can cause toe overlap issues for riders on smaller frames, especially where mudguards are also factored in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How waterproof are winter cycling shoes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many winter cycling shoes prioritise weatherproofing in their design, including taped seams, water repellent uppers and waterproof zips, as well as breathable membranes such as Gore-Tex to keep the shoes breathable too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some brands offer more than one type of winter cycling shoe, for example one model designed for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-guide-to-wet-weather-riding\" target=\"_blank\">wet conditions</a> and another designed for cold but drier weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any shoe, winter cycling shoes can be compromised at the ankle if water seeps through your bib tights and into your socks, so in some cases riders choose to layer their tights over the top of the boot’s ankle to reduce water ingress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many standard road cycling shoes that are optimised for warmer summer riding, winter cycling shoes don’t tend to have any vents on the sole, so that’s one less place for water to get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How warm are winter cycling shoes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter cycling shoes are designed with fewer vents and more thermal insulation than standard cycling shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many feature a higher cuff up the ankle, which helps avoid any gap between the shoe and bottom of the tights. Be wary of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bib-tights\" target=\"_blank\">bib tights</a> that feature zips at the bottom as these can cause some discomfort when pressed against the side of boots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some winter cycling shoes use a thermal liner such as the Fizik Tempo Artica GTX’s fleece lining and some models will also have a foil backing to the insole to help retain heat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do winter cycling shoes fit the same as standard cycling shoes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Built to accommodate a chunkier <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-winter-cycling-socks\" target=\"_blank\">winter sock</a>, you may find that winter cycling shoes are a bit roomier than standard cycling shoes, which are typically worn with a thinner, more lightweight sock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any shoes, it’s best to try before you buy to work out what size works best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter cycling shoes often have a more flexible sole than standard models, or at least performance-oriented shoes, so you may notice that when it comes to your riding too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What closure method is best for winter cycling shoes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Lake CX146 winter road cycling boots\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lake-CX146-winter-road-cycling-boots-6-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of different closure methods when it comes to winter cycling shoes – essentially anything but laces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some boots use weatherproof zips, while others use Boa dial and lace systems coupled with Velcro tabs. Where tongues feature, these are often continuous with the shoe’s outer to minimise water and wind ingress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these shoes are designed to be used with gloves, so simplicity is key. Look for a pair of winter cycling shoes that are easy to get on and off – especially if you prefer wearing thicker socks. It can save you precious minutes at the end of your ride when all you’re dreaming of is getting into the warm shower and a cup of tea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking for more ways to winterise your ride?
