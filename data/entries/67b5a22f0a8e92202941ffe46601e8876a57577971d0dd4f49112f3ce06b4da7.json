This buyer’s guide is our round-up of the best mountain bikes currently available between £500 and £750, as tested by BikeRadar.</p>\n<p>Budget is prioritised above all else when you’re sticking below <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-500/\" target=\"_blank\">£500 for a mountain bike</a>, while breaking <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\" target=\"_blank\">the £1,000 mark</a> gives manufacturers a little more wiggle room to tailor frames to specific purposes and spec higher-quality components.</p>\n<p>At £750, you’re caught between managing your budget and keeping your expectations realistic. You’ll come across some nicer kit on bikes in this price range, but there may be only one or two standout components among a spec list that’s predominantly made up of basic parts.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry too much about compromising though, because manufacturers realise this is a price point that’s largely governed by budget.</p>\n<p>As such, they tend to focus their attention on producing a decent frame and pick components that will keep costs down, on the assumption that you’ll gradually upgrade them as they wear out over time.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vitus Nucleus 29 VR is a fantastic bike for the money.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton</i></span></div>\n<p>The trick, therefore, is to seek out a bike with a frame that’s best for you and use that as a platform on which to build. You can always upgrade parts when you’re riding has improved or you’ve got a bit of extra cash.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">Dropper posts</a> are becoming more common at this price too, as are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">hydraulic disc brakes</a> and Boost wheel spacing which makes it easier to upgrade a mountain bike’s wheels. These are three things that previously were only really seen on more expensive mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get fixated on finding the best fork, gears, brakes or wheel and tyre combination, but you also need to consider the sort of abuse the weather and landscape can inflict on them in a relatively short space of time – especially during winter.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re limited to £750, prioritise the chassis over the fancy baubles hanging off it. With that in mind, these are the best mountain bikes under £750 tested by us.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Best mountain bikes under £750 in 2021, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Carrera Fury: </strong>£600</li>\n<li><strong>Marin Bobcat Trail 3:</strong> £525</li>\n<li><strong>Pinnacle Kapur 3: </strong>£625</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Carrera Fury</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Carrera Fury offers fantastic performance for its price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£600 as tested</li>\n<li>Comfortable on climbs</li>\n<li>Great spec and value for money</li>\n</ul><p>The Carrera Fury offers some of the best value for money with a dropper post and hydraulic brakes, both of which are normally indicative of a higher price point.</p>\n<p>The geometry offers great performance too, with a progressive design that gives a comfy ride on climbs and descents.

The smallest sizes are specced with 27.5in wheels only.</p>\n<p>The tan wall tyres really stand out, complementing the overall look of the bike. The rest of the kit is fairly standard for the bike’s price point and although it performs well, isn’t exceptional.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Bobcat Trail 3’s spec and geometry make the bike well-suited to long days in the saddle with a focus on miles covered rather than metres descended on aggressive trails. A few key spec changes – such as the fork and tyres – would unlock more potential from the frame.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/marin-bobcat-trail-3-review/\">Read the full Marin Bobcat Trail 3 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Pinnacle Kapur 3</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With its trail-friendly geometry, RockShox fork and Shimano brakes, the Kapur certainly looks the part.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£625 as tested</li>\n<li>Nippy, agile and fun</li>\n<li>RockShox front fork</li>\n</ul><p>Decked out with a RockShox fork, Shimano brakes and solid trail-focused geometry, the Kapur 3 would be a great first mountain bike because it’s an absolute hoot to ride.</p>\n<p>Although the frame’s quite basic – think no internally-routed cables, no port for a dropper post or fancy-shaped tubes – it does have two bottle cage mounts and great geometry for newbies to the sport.</p>\n<p>Its spec really stands out, though.

It also looks pretty smart too.</p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Shimano Acera</a> 9-speed cassette on the back of the bike and two front chainrings, giving the Rockhopper plenty of gears for climbing and descending. You do have to watch gear changing though because sometimes the spread of gears can interrupt pedalling <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a>.</p>\n<p>The Rockhopper climbs well and has plenty of grip, only struggling on the steepest inclines.</p>\n<p>When it comes to descending its happiest on compacted flowing trails. The short geometry doesn’t make riding on technical trails that easy and the front suspension is a bit sticky.</p>\n<p>Good for starting out and pootling about, but some riders might reach the limits of the Rockhopper’s capabilities fairly quickly.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/specialized-rockhopper-comp-29-2x-review/\">Read our full Specialized Rockhopper Comp 29 2x review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Vitus Nucleus 29 VRS</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Nucleus felt stiff on the descents.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£750 as tested</li>\n<li>Shimano Deore-based groupset</li>\n<li>Good grippy tyres</li>\n</ul><p>The Nucleus 29 VRS comes from Chain Reactions’ in-house brand Vitus.
