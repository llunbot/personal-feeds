This is a pre-production prototype.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Let’s start with weight. Yakubowicz says combining the threads and the frame cuts the majority of the material out of a traditional threaded bottom bracket, saving in the region of 100g. Whether that matters to you or not is a different question.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The threads are moulded directly into the carbon frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bridge Bike Works</i></span></div>\n<p>As for alignment, Yakubowicz says that, with the threads moulded to shape, the “BB is perfectly aligned out of the tool”. This avoids, the brand says, the possibility of the bearing cups being misaligned, or poor quality control of the bottom bracket area leading to non-concentricity. We’ve only seen this for the first time at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/sea-otter/\">Sea Otter</a> so can’t comment on performance or longevity.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bridge has used the T47-86 bottom bracket standard.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The threads have a Cerakote coating to create a “robust barrier” between the frame and bearing cups, according to Bridge. Bridge also claims it protects them from galvanic corrosion.</p>\n<p>Bridge has opted to use the standard T47-86 bottom bracket standard for the Surveyor, meaning it is compatible with 86mm-wide shells. However, the brand says the moulded technology can be applied to “any threads on the bike, including other standard bottom brackets”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Surveyor is Bridge Bike Works’ first frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>As for the Surveyor, this is Bridge’s first bike, and it’s made in Toronto.
