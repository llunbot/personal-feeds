We recently discovered that the upcoming tvOS 18.3 update for the Apple TV has a new <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1882223043889758219\">UNITY25 reference</a> hidden within its code, which suggests that the Black Unity campaign may continue in 2025. If so, it is likely that Apple will make an announcement about it next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Watch-Black-Unity-Band-2024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nIt is unclear if there will be any other product announcements next week beyond a new Black Unity band. Apple is expected to announce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/macbook-air-with-m4-chip-rumors/\">updated MacBook Air models with the M4 chip</a> in early 2025, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/19/when-to-expect-powerbeats-pro-2/\">Powerbeats Pro 2 are also coming soon</a>, but Gurman did not mention anything beyond a potential Black Unity band in his social media post today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/ios-18-3-expected-to-be-released-next-week/\">expected to release iOS 18.3</a>, macOS 15.3, and other software updates next week, following more than a month of beta testing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCross your fingers that the merchandise updates means that Apple will have a busy week ahead, but keep your expectations tempered.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/25/apple-store-merchandise-updates-next-week/\">Gurman: Apple Stores Receiving 'Merchandise' Updates Next Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-stores-receiving-merchandise-updates-next-week.2448118/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0b2f030926e2ae617da0d6f765a64f1800e503895af1c2100a7d8a015521661","category":"Apple"}
