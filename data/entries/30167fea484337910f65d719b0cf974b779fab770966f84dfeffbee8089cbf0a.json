With this sale, when you buy two or more Anker products sitewide you can get 25 percent off your entire order. There are also a few \"mystery boxes\" that can include hundreds of dollars in savings, if you're willing to risk not knowing what you're buying ahead of time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/anker-new-gold.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Anker.

This device has space to simultaneously charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1336-20000mah-power-bank?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=42691854925974\">Anker Prime 20,000 mAh Power Bank with Smart Digital Display</a> ($129.99). Although this one is on sale at $110.49 without the bundle deal, if you buy this and the 3-in-1 Cube together, you'll net a bigger discount. The Power Bank will be knocked down to $97.50 and the 3-in-1 Cube will go down to $112.46 thanks to the 25 percent savings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>25% OFF</div>Anker Black Friday Early Access</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu\">bottom of the Black Friday Early Access sale page</a>, Anker also has a few blind boxes on sale, priced at $19.99 (up to $219.99 in value) and at $59.99 (up to $799.99 in value). These mystery boxes include one Anker accessory, but you won't know what you're getting until they arrive. All items in the $19.99 box are worth more than $19.99, and all items in the $59.99 box are worth more than $59.99, so no matter what you'll be getting a deal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll mystery box items are non-returnable (with the exception of quality issues). They are also excluded from the 25 percent off promotion when purchasing two or more items. These could net you a huge discount with a collection of solid stocking stuffers for the holidays, if you're willing to take the blind box risk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Wall Chargers</strong>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a2668?variant=41974350315670\">65W 3-Port USB-C Charger</a> - $37.99, down from $59.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a2669-3-port-wall-charger\">67W 3-Port USB-C Charger</a> - $45.00, down from $59.99 [<a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C4YTB56H%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.1MTQQ9ONIG1WQ%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.1MTQQ9ONIG1WQ_1697469063005\">Amazon</a>]</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a2340?variant=41974288777366\">150W 4-Port USB-C Charger</a> - $87.99, down from $109.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a2342-240w-gan-charger?variant=42691851550870\">Prime 240W 4-Port Desktop Charger</a> - $139.99, down from $199.99</li></ul>\r<br />\n<strong>Portable Batteries</strong>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1653-usb-c-portable-charger-5000mah\">Nano Power Bank with Foldable USB-C Connector</a> - $25.50, down from $29.99 [<a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C6XK77HJ\">Amazon</a>]</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1268\">PowerCore 20,000 mAh</a> - $36.52, down from $49.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1651\">PowerCore 10,000 mAh</a> - $69.99, down from $99.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1289\">PowerCore 24,000 mAh Power Bank with Smart Digital Display</a> - $99.99, down from $159.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/b1291\">PowerCore 26,000 mAh</a> - $99.99, down from $149.99</li></ul> \r<br />\n<strong>Portable Power Stations</strong>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1751\">PowerHouse 535</a> - $399.99, down from $499.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1761\">SOLIX C1000 Power Station</a> - $749.00, down from $999.00</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1770111\">PowerHouse 757</a> - $799.99, down from $1,099.99</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43469&amp;murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1780\">PowerHouse 767</a> - $1,599.00, down from $1,999.00</li></ul> You can find <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/best-early-black-friday-apple-deals/\"><strong>all the Apple Black Friday Deals currently available</strong></a> in our dedicated post.
