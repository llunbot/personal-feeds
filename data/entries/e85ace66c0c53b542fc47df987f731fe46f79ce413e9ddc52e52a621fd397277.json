{"title":"The White House Correspondants Association Speaks Cowardice to Power","link":"https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/whca-drops-amber-ruffin-performance-dinner-1236351795/","date":1743432139000,"content":"\n<p>Brian Steinberg and Pat Saperstein, reporting for Variety over the weekend:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The White House Correspondents’ Association has canceled plans to\nhave comedian Amber Ruffin perform at its annual dinner on April\n26, a new sign of the pressures being brought to bear on news\norganizations during President Donald Trump’s second term.</p>\n\n<p>The journalism group, which has seen its control over interactions\nwith Trump eroded in recent weeks, made the decision after Taylor\nBudowich, a White House deputy chief of staff, raised comments\nRuffin has made in the past that are critical of Trump. Earlier\nthis week, Ruffin told a podcast backed by The Daily Beast that\nshe would not try to make sure her jokes targeted all sides of the\npolitical spectrum as the WHCA had requested, and likened the\nTrump administration to “kind of a bunch of murderers.” Playing to\nboth sides “makes them feel like human beings,” she said, “cause\nthey’re not.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>“The WHCA board has unanimously decided we are no longer featuring\na comedic performance this year. At this consequential moment for\njournalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of\ndivision but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their\noutstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the\nnext generation of journalists,” WHCA president Eugene Daniels\nwrote to members in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>“For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a\nre-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year,” he added.\n“As the date nears, I will share more details of the plans in\nplace to honor journalistic excellence and a robust, independent\nmedia covering the most powerful office in the world.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What an enormous mountain of obvious horseshit this explanation is. The WHCA only announced that Ruffin would be hosting this year’s show on February 4, at which point this lickspittle clown Eugene Daniels <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/amber-ruffin-2025-white-house-correspondents-dinner-1236126815/\">was quoted thus by The Hollywood Reporter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“When I began to think about what entertainer would be a perfect\nfit for the dinner this year, Amber was immediately at the top of\nmy list,” Eugene Daniels of Politico, president of the\nassociation, said in a statement on Tuesday. “She has the ability\nto walk the line between blistering commentary and humor all while\nprovoking her audience to think about the important issues of the\nday. I’m thrilled and honored she said yes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So eight weeks ago this obsequious bootlicker Daniels thought Amber Ruffin “would be a perfect fit for the dinner this year” but now, four weeks before the show, he’s trying to claim with a straight face that “For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a re-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year”?</p>\n\n<p>The kids magazine Highlights for Children has a long-running comic strip called “Goofus and Gallant”, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/06/goofus-and-gallant-american-parenting-highlights/674536/\">the premise of which</a> is that Goofus is a kid who always does the wrong thing, and Gallant always does the right thing. Goofus, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/goofus-gallant-1948.jpg\">especially in the older strips</a>, is an absurd parody. This Eugene Daniels toady is the Goofus of journalism. The entire point of the WHCA is to assert the group’s collective independence as journalists — and the independence they assert is specifically from the White House. So of course they shouldn’t have responded to White House pressure to fire Ruffin as this year’s host. But it’s even worse for an ostensible journalist — the president of the WHCA for chrissakes — to try to get even a single person in the world to believe that this is anything other than caving to White House pressure, and that in fact (“<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRKhdQnd-k\">Yeah, that’s the ticket!</a></em>”) he’d been planning to cancel the entire concept of having a comedian host at all “for the past couple of weeks” when just eight weeks ago he described Ruffin as “a perfect fit for the dinner this year”.</p>\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/baghdad-bob-and-his-ridiculous-true-predictions/274241/\">Baghdad Bob</a> level nonsense. I’m not one for performative resignations, but how does any news outlet or journalist agree to remain a member of the WHCA after this?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/31/the-white-house-correspondants-association-speaks-cowardice-to-power\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e85ace66c0c53b542fc47df987f731fe46f79ce413e9ddc52e52a621fd397277","category":"Tech"}
