The headliner is (of course) 21 new emojis, like new heart colors, additional animals, and a shaking head. Beyond that, though, Apple says you'll see improved voice isolation on phone calls, support for notifications from web apps that have been added to your phone's home screen, new ways to weed out duplicates in your Photos library, and a number of bug fixes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927095#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927095&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be2618a18f07be47aabc1523b2f4c64ba9d12ef894f3ba2f0aaa6d5f94241c1f","category":"Tech"}
