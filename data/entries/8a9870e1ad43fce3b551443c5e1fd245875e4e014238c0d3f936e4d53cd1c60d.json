There’s no better way to experience the Community of Madrid Region’s diverse landscapes, gastronomy and culture than by bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want to follow in the footsteps of Spanish royals at San Lorenzo de El Escorial or mountaineer your way up to the top of Mount Abantos, there’s more cycling than meets the eye in the Madrid Region of Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Gran Tour</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A route suitable for Vuelta champions, the 420km Gran Tour route lassos around Madrid to take in all the sights and sounds of the region. Broken up into 17 stages, it loops from Aranjuez via Alcalá de Henares and San Lorenzo de El Escorial. Along the <em>parcours</em>, the Gran Tour brushes past the towering Sierra Norte, Sierra Guadarrama and Sierra Oeste mountain chains while avoiding the busier roads of Madrid itself and the tough slopes of the region’s peaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with each stage only around 20-30km in length, the Gran Tour really is suited to riders of all ages and abilities – it’s an ideal opportunity for the whole family to ride together and soak up the scenery. Plus, its flat profile makes it accessible for all cycling abilities and bike types.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CICLOTURSIMO-SIERRA-OESTE_DJ1A4976%C2%A9CiclaMadrid_Comunidad-de-Madrid-647x970.jpg\" /><figcaption>Photo: CiclaMadrid</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>CiclaMadrid’s Gran Tour offers a unique experience for cycling tourism lovers to explore the natural beauty and rich historical heritage of the Madrid Region. San Lorenzo de El Escorial, with its imposing Monastery and natural surroundings, is one of the most outstanding destinations on this route.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fit for a king</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To the north of Madrid lies the UNESCO World Heritage site of El Escorial, the former seat of the Spanish royal family. Under the backdrop of the Sierra de Guadarrama, this royal complex is centred around the grand El Escorial monastery overseen by King Philip II of Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The palace’s Royal Library is a must-see with its fresco paintings that date back to the Spanish Renaissance. Connecting with Madrid’s natural side, the gardens of the Casita del Príncipe allow visitors to take in the flora and fauna of Madrid’s royals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valmayor Reservoir – one of Madrid’s largest reservoirs – is within touching distance from the palace. With its array of watersports and bird-watching spots, the reservoir also proposes a network of biking and hiking trails around the water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to reach San Lorenzo de El Escorial in style, you can take the historic Philip II train from Príncipe Pío station in central Madrid. The heritage train line uses 20th-century trains with an elegant interior that harks back to 1940s Spain. The old carriages are also fitted with bike storage during summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for more miles in the legs? San Lorenzo de El Escorial is only 50km north of Madrid’s central Plaza Mayor. This way, you can tick off some natural sites including Casa de Campo, Madrid’s largest public park, and the Guadarrama River Regional Park.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/madrid-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Photo: CiclaMadrid</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>On the wild side</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>San Lorenzo de El Escorial is an ideal place to base yourself in the Madrid Region. Over the course of a single weekend, it’s possible to take in the city centre of Madrid, the royal palaces of El Escorial and a mountain escape. For the latter, Mount Abantos sits just behind the town. It’s a well-trodden ascent for cyclists, even featuring in the Vuelta a España on several occasions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CiclaMadrid suggests taking a 40km loop up into the wilderness of Mount Abantos. This should be easily achievable in an afternoon. From the top of the 1,753m tall mountain, you can catch views across the region as well as nearby Castile and Léon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the summit, riders and hikers alike are greeted with the Valle de los Caídos monument. The memorial, which translates to the Valley of the Fallen in English, was built to honour perished soldiers from the Spanish Civil War. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For mountain bikers, there’s a wide selection of downhill tracks perfect for an adrenaline-pumping return to San Lorenzo de El Escorial. If you do not want to brave the trip on two wheels, the GR10 hiking route also navigates its way around the climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Escape the rush of the city</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the city of Madrid has plenty to explore, the wider region around it offers a quieter side to life. With an extensive public transport network across the region, it is easy to escape the city within an hour by bus or train.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get off the beaten track and clock up some altitude, the Madrid Region also presents some routes into the mountains of Sierra de Guadarrama and Sierra Norte with a number of tougher uphill rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its landlocked location, this Madrid Region also boasts some of the country’s most unique beaches. The San Juan Reservoir near San Martín de Valdeiglesias in the Sierra Oeste is a great place to find them. Kayaking and fishing are also popular in spots such as the nearby Pelayos de la Presa. For beginners of paddle sports, the calm waters will be ideal for getting to grips with the sport.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CICLOTURISMO_Sierra-Oeste-San-Martin-de-Valdeiglesias%C2%A9CiclaMadrid_Comunidad-de-Madrid-970x647.jpg\" /><figcaption>Photo: CiclaMadrid</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Important pilgrimage routes also crisscross this part of Spain, none bigger than the Camino de Santiago de Compostella which crosses the Madrid Region in some parts. The CiclaMadrid network allows cyclists to join some of this legendary route. Along with the pilgrims making the long journey north, the Camino de Madrid and the Camino Mendocino also share the path of CiclaMadrid bike routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Soak up the best lifestyle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dotted around the route of the Gran Tour, the<em> Villas de Madrid</em> are a collective of villages that showcase the untapped culture of the Madrid region. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The towns are unique in their own way, varying in landscape, local offerings and architecture. They include San Martín de Valdeiglesias in the west which hosts the historic Castillo de la Coracera, the wine-making town of Chinchón in the south, and Manzanares el Real with its lakeside castle nestled in the Cuenca Alta del Manzanares Regional Park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These <em>Villas </em>poised on the rural outskirts of the capital welcome visitors to bask in the authentic central Spanish way of life. During summer, the villages throw cultural festivities and events to celebrate the local community, including Chinchón’s summer-long <em>Noches de Verano </em>music festival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These villages are also the perfect place to enjoy local specialities such as the garlic-heavy Castilian soup and veal from the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains. Along the route of the Gran Tour, Aranjuez has a strong strawberry-making tradition, or for something a little more indulgent, the Madrid Region has an abundance of cheesemakers and chocolatiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emulating the taste of King Philip II, winemaking has a strong foothold in the region. Tempranillo and Garnacha are the most common wines around Madrid, with vineyards scattered around the capital. El Molar vineyards can be found to the northeast, Arganda to the south, Gran Tour stop-off San Martín de Valdeiglesias in the west with its historic terroir, and Navalcarnero in the southwest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no better way to take in the Madrid way of life in all its diversity than by bike. With CiclaMadrid’s variety of routes of all levels, it’s truly possible to ride at your own pace and immerse yourself in what the locals claim to be the ‘world’s best lifestyle’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• Find out more about the Madrid Region at the <a href=\"https://www.turismomadrid.es/en\" target=\"_blank\">Community of Madrid website</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/madrid-region-cycling\">Discover the rich heritage of the Madrid Region</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8a9870e1ad43fce3b551443c5e1fd245875e4e014238c0d3f936e4d53cd1c60d","category":"Cycling"}
