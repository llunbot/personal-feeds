Here’s what’s on sale:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Adapter/dp/B09V3GZD32/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$1,299: Apple Studio Display with Standard Glass and Tilt-Adjustable stand</a> (MSRP $1,599)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Adapter/dp/B09V3HMZW5/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$1,699: Apple Studio Display with Standard Glass and Tilt and Height-Adjustable Stand</a> (MSRP $1,999)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Adapter/dp/B09V3HP4KL/?&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$1,599: Apple Studio Display with Nano-Texture Glass and Tilt-Adjustable Stand</a> (MSRP $1,899)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Studio Display is a 27-inch monitor with 5K resolution (5120×2880 at 218 pixels per inch). It offers 600 nits of brightness, support for the P3 color gamut, and True Tone. The Standard Glass is actually a semi-glossy surface, while the Nano-Texture Glass is closer to a matte-like surface and produces less glare. The Studio Display also has a 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage support, as well as a three-microphone array. It also has six speakers with support for Spatial Audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">review of the Studio Display</a>, I wrote: “If you are a general user who makes the occasional videos in iMovie, and does some light photo editing or other creative work, you’ll enjoy the Studio Display.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Save $100 on the Mac mini</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a Mac to go along with that Studio Display–or you’re just looking for a new desktop Mac in general–check on Amazon’s deal on the Mac mini. The M2 and M2 Pro models are $100 off the regular price.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0BSHGHGXR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$499: M2 Mac mini with 8GB of memory, 256GB SSD</a> (MSRP $599)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0BSHGTPMV/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$699: M2 Mac mini with 8GB of memory, 512GB SSD</a> (MSRP $799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0BSHFS6XX/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$1,199: M2 Pro Mac mini with 8GB of memory, 512GB SSD</a> (MSRP $1,299)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480091/mac-mini-m2-pro-review.html\">review of the M2 Pro Mac mini</a>, we thought that the $1,299 price was too high for what you get.
