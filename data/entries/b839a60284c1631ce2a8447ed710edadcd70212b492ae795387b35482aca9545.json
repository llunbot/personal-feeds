However, Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2025/03/believe-apples-emmy-award-winning-global-hit-ted-lasso-renewed-for-season-four-with-jason-sudeikis-set-to-return-as-star-and-executive-producer/\">announcement</a> does not state when the new season will arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap,’” said Jason Sudeikis, the show’s executive producer who also plays the titular character, in a press release. “In season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudeikis appeared on the Kelce brothers’ New Heights podcast to announce season four, stating that “they’re writing season four now” and that “Ted’s coaching a women’s team.” At the end of season three, the AFC Richmond club coached by Lasso was considering a women’s team spearheaded by Keeley Jones (Juno Temple). You can watch the Sudeikis interview below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors of a fourth season had been rumbling around ever since season three ended in 2022, including speculation of a spin-off series without star Sudeikis. Deadline <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/ted-lasso-season-4-officially-a-go-with-jason-sudeikis-juno-temple-in-negotiations-to-join-returning-cast-as-apple-series-heads-to-kansas/ar-AA1AVsb5\">reports</a> that season four will include cast members Brett Goldstein (Roy Kent) and Jeremy Swift (Leslie Higgins), along with Hannah Waddington (Rebecca Welton) and Temple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With writing in the works now, production will start later this year so season four could be available at the end of the year or in early 2026.
