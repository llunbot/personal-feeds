The brand has come a fair way since its fledgling garden shed setup in 2015. At the moment, Joe has seven current production frames to his name. The front triangles of most of these frames are fabricated in-house, at their Bristol workshop. Meanwhile, the majority of the swingarms are manufactured in Taiwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swoop 27.5″, the Twist Mixed-Wheel, the Murmur 29″, and the recent MegaMurmur trail and enduro bikes form Starling’s “core” lineup. But, they also manufacture some rather more “rare” models. These include the wildly fun Roost Hardtail, the Beady Little Eye (a 90mm travel mixed-wheel single-speed), and the Murmur Stainless. They also offer a custom frame building service for anyone after something special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Joe is something of a tinkerer, and is seemingly always working away on special projects. Some of them he labels “exercises in R&amp;D”. Others are simply so niche that a limited production run is the only viable option. Superb examples of the latter include the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/starling-spur-is-a-high-single-pivot-steel-gearbox-mountain-bike-with-170mm-travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Spur</a> – a high-pivot 170mm travel gearbox-equipped enduro bike – and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/starling-sturn-v2-is-a-single-speed-jack-shaft-sporting-high-pivot-downhill-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Sturn</a> – a single-speed high-pivot downhill bike with a Jack Shaft drivetrain arrangement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, we stopped by the Starling Cycles HQ in Bristol, to find out what founder Joe McEwan has brewing for the company’s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>All photos from Bikerumor, unless otherwise stated</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"joe mcewan interview starling cycles workshop steel bike manufacturing future mtb geometry technology\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/starling-cycles-joe-mcewan-interview-workshop-tour-bristol.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Joe McEwan outside his new workshop in Bristol, England, with a one-of-a-kind Stainless Starling Twist mixed-wheel enduro bike</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interview | Joe McEwan on What’s to Come for Starling Cycles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bikerumor:</strong> <em>This year, you launched the V3 Murmur, Twist and Swoop frames. During their development, did you ever consider moving away from the single-pivot suspension platform and if so, for what reasons?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Starling Cycles:</strong> I love single pivot! With modern coil shocks it rides as good as multi-links, if not better in many cases! I would like to have a vertical shock sitting close to the seat tube: for aesthetics, commonality in manufacture between sizes and more frame space. But I can’t see how to achieve this elegantly without a linkage, so it’s a compromise too far!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

The suspension performance and silence made it the most amazing descending bike I’ve ever ridden. But, there is a little bit of drag which means it is best suited to a more gravity orientated bike.

But, I think as motor and battery technology allows for more compact systems, I might be able to do a Starling ebike and still keep the elegant design I value so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg-800x534.webp\" alt=\"freeflow starling jack drive prototype emtb\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg-800x534.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/freeflow-ff60-ebike-motor-on-jack-drive-starling-steel-full-suspension-emtb-prototype-jpg.webp 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Starling Cycles’ prototype eMTB with high-pivot jack-shaft layout and a prototype strain wave motor from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/freeflow-technologies-strain-wave-ebike-motor/\" target=\"_blank\">FreeFlow technologies</a>.

The long, low, slack suits rough high speed terrain, but maybe at the expense of some pop and maneuverability. Personally, the more I think about it, the more I think we need to think about how we ride and what geometry suits our needs, rather than just thinking making it as long as possible is best. There’s an ergonomic aspect too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg-800x534.webp\" alt=\"2023 starling swoop 275 v3 trail enduro mtb\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg-800x534.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2023-starling-swoop-version-3-trail-enduro-mode-jpg.webp 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-starling-murmur-swoop-twist-trail-enduro/\" target=\"_blank\">V3 Starling Swoop, Twist and Murmur</a> actually have a higher BB than their predecessors <em>“to add a little more clearance and a little more maneuverability to a very stable geometry”</em>.

You need to pick the compromise to suit your riding style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taller riders need bigger bikes, bigger bikes need longer stays to balance out the bike. And, the reverse for shorter riders. Longer travel bikes add grip and bump eating at the expense of pedalling and pop. Shorter travel bikes provide a firmer platform for better pedalling and pop, at the expense of grip and bump eating. You need to pick the compromise to suit your riding style.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"starling roost mullet hardtail review stainless steel frame golfy scotland\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/starling-roost-mullet-hardtail-mtb-stainless-steel-frame.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Only the Starling Roost hardtail (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/starling-roost-review/\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed here</a>) benefits from size-specific chainstay lengths; 425mm on the small, 430mm on the medium, and 435mm on the large.

Heavy wheels and tough tyres for grip and control, the weight actually keeps them stable in the rough, but they are harder to pedal. Light wheels and fast rolling tyres for pedalling speed on smooth terrain and fast climbing, but they are terrible in rough terrain. You need to pick the compromise to suit your riding style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My main thought is that nothing is the golden ticket, you always need to pick where you want your compromise to sit. Although, marketing tries to tell you otherwise, it’s just not true! I try to provide a range of bikes that allows you to pick the compromise you want with minimum hassle!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"starling cycles carbon fiber mold thermoplastic prototype emtb\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-prototype-carbon-ebike-mold.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bikerumor:</strong> <em>Do you have any predictions for where mountain bike technology is headed in the next 10 years, and how will Starling Cycles be a part of that?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Starling Cycles:</strong> I have a bit of a conflict on this. I’m an engineer and I love technology and improving performance. But, we’re biking for fun, even with racing we’re mostly doing it for fun, and we had as much fun on bikes from 20 years ago as we do now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the incremental gains we see now are driven more by marketing and the need for change than any actual greater enjoyment for the sport. I suppose the fact they don’t break as much anymore is a positive. But other than that, we’d have as much fun on a Klunker. I think the emergence of gravel is partly driven by this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the trend for the future is less technology and more engaging riding on stock Klunkers with ‘standards’ that are real standards!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"starling cycles front triangle realignment post brazing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-steel-front-triangle-alignment-testing.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>A front triangle is re-aligned 5 times throughout its fabrication, particularly after tacking and the brazing of each joint, the heat produced from which introduce subtle misalignment.

Whereas in the EU and many other places it is understood that manufacturing is key to a strong economy and it is respected.

We get our swingarms made in Taiwan, but are very transparent about it, other companies are much less transparent…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to be proud of what we can do here and shout about it. There’s lots of great UK brands doing exciting things with manufacturing in the UK; Starling, Atherton Bikes, Stanton, Moulton, Brompton and many more. The rest of the world take pride in supporting their local brands. UK manufacturing was killed in the 80s with crap cars, so nobody buys British anymore! So, we will struggle on. Sorry, that did get a bit political.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"starling cycles front triangles waiting further fabrication addition of gussets swingarm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starling-cycles-brazed-steel-front-triangles-hanging-madeinuk-full-suspension-mtb.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>UK-made Starling front triangles waiting to meet their Taiwanese swingarms made by ORA. The beauty of any steel frame is that, should it crack or dent in any scenario, it is often repairable. You know what happens to carbon frames that crack… Starling have detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.starlingcycles.com/warranty/\" target=\"_blank\">frame warranty</a>, and the repairs they are able to carry out in house, on their website.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to order a frame today, you’d wait somewhere between 8-16 weeks for delivery. Starling are working hard to increase their UK production capacity through training a third frame builder to join the team, hoping to bring lead time down to around 4 weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.starlingcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">starlingcycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/starling-cycles-future-innovationschallenges-of-uk-manufacturing-interview/\">Starling Cycles’ Future Innovations &amp; the Challenges of UK Manufacturing | Interview</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"895265b3dae5b26503941f757f674f1ed5977489f5349f689ca9f97cbc2fe3dd","category":"Cycling"}
