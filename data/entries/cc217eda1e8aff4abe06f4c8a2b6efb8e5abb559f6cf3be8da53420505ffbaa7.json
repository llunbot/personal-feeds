The oversight basically meant any other running app or process could potentially access the ChatGPT conversations without prompting the user for permission.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote> <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6\" target=\"_blank\"> <div><div>  </div> <div> Post by @pvieito</div> <div> View on Threads</div></div></a></blockquote>\r<br />\n</div>\r<br />\nAfter <em>The Verge</em> contacted OpenAI about the issue, the company released an update that it says encrypts the chats. \"We are aware of this issue and have shipped a new version of the application which encrypts these conversations,\" OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson told the website. \"We're committed to providing a helpful user experience while maintaining our high security standards as our technology evolves.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter downloading the update (v1.2024.171), Pereira Vieito's app no longer works, and Peters said he was no longer able to see his conversations with the chatbot in plain text.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/chatgpt-mac-app-stored-chats-plain-text/\">ChatGPT Mac App Stored User Chats in Plain Text Prior to Latest Update</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-mac-app-stored-user-chats-in-plain-text-prior-to-latest-update.2430674/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cc217eda1e8aff4abe06f4c8a2b6efb8e5abb559f6cf3be8da53420505ffbaa7","category":"Apple"}
