The 4090 offers unparalleled performance but at an unparalleled price of $1,600 (prices have not fallen). It's not for everybody, but it's a nice halo card that shows what the Ada Lovelace architecture is capable of. Fine, I guess.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/\">RTX 4080</a> soon followed, along with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/review-amds-radeon-rx-7900-gpus-are-great-4k-gaming-gpus-with-caveats/\">AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT</a>. These cards also generally offered better performance than anything you could get from a previous-generation GPU, but at still-too-high-for-most-people prices that ranged from between $900 and $1,200 (though all of those prices have fallen by a bit). Fine, I guess.</p>\n\n<p>By the time we got the 4070 Ti launch in May, we were getting down to the level of performance that had been available from previous-generation cards. These GPUs offered a decent generational jump over their predecessors (the 4070 Ti performs kind of like a 3090, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/rtx-4070-review-an-ideal-gpu-for-anyone-who-skipped-the-graphics-card-shortage/\">the 4070</a> performs kind of like a 3080). But those cards also got big price bumps that took them closer to the pricing levels of the last-gen cards they performed like. Fine, I guess.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963686#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963686&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8167696af15582f225e0d46af577d0701d2c9f3afcef924d28189db85d4e628f","category":"Tech"}
