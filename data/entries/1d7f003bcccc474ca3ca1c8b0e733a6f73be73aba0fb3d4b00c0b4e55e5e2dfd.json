MacRumors editor-in-chief Eric Slivka <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/2020-infiniti-qx50-carplay/\">reviewed wired CarPlay in the 2020 QX50</a> last year and the vehicle is now eligible for the complimentary wireless CarPlay upgrade.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWireless CarPlay works over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, allowing for an iPhone to be connected to the infotainment system without a Lightning cable.
