It connected the power of Google Maps to the phone app, allowing the phone search bar to not only look through your contacts but also businesses listed in Google Maps. When you want to call the local pizza place, just type in the name, rather than some arcane string of numbers, and hit \"dial.\"<p></p>\n<p>The feature has been around on Pixel phones since at least the Pixel 2 and has been <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-app-now-verifies-calls-and-its-coming-to-more-devices/\">generally available</a> to anyone who downloaded the \"Phone by Google\" app in the Play Store for the past few years. It was a perfect \"Google\" feature, combining the company's OS, breadth of online data, and search into a useful function. Google has made its AI-infused phone app a<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/hold-for-me/\"> primary selling point</a> of Pixel phones over the years, so stripping it of features is weird.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010954#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010954&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df73d1edb8c5cbe260b2319be5423cc16ddc06b1c54fe91d70c52f8bb180f663","category":"Tech"}
