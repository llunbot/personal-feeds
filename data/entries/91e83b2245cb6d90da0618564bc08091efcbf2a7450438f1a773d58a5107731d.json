{"title":"Apple Intelligence Hits Beta With New Beta OS Releases for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and MacOS 15.1 Sequoia","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/07/new-betas-for-ios-18-1-ipados-18-1-and-macos-sequoia-bring-some-apple-intelligence-features/","date":1722295881000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Not all features, as I said, will be available to try out in this\nrelease. Among those included are the systemwide Writing Tools\nfeatures to help proofread and rewrite text; inbox prioritization,\nsummaries, and smart reply in Mail; the new Reduce Interruptions\nfocus mode; natural language search for photos and videos as well\nas the ability to create Memories movies on demands; summaries for\ntranscriptions; and, perhaps most enticingly, improved Siri\nfunctionality, including the ability to move between voice and\ntyping, more resilient requests for when you stumble over your\nwords, and answering questions about Apple products.</p>\n\n<p>As for what you won’t find here, don’t expect the contentious\nimage generation features like Image Playground, the ability to\nclean up and remove unwanted details from photos, and integration\nwith ChatGPT. It’s unclear if those will appear in future builds\nof these betas, or as subsequent updates after public release.\nAlso unclear is whether there will be a public beta of these\nversions down the road for non-developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wish I would have predicted that Apple was going to start seeding these .1 OS betas previewing Apple Intelligence features while the .0 versions remain in beta until (presumably) release in September, because in hindsight it seems obvious. Will there be <em>public</em> betas of these Apple Intelligence OS versions soon? Unknown at the moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> MacRumors: “<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/\">Here Are All of the Apple Intelligence Features in the iOS 18.1 Developer Beta</a>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/29/apple-intelligence-os-betas\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"91e83b2245cb6d90da0618564bc08091efcbf2a7450438f1a773d58a5107731d","category":"Tech"}
