The teen tested positive for H5 bird flu at BC's public health laboratory, and the result is currently being confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p>The teen's case reportedly began with conjunctivitis, echoing the H5N1 human case reports in the US. The case then progressed to fever and cough, and the teen was admitted to BC's Children's hospital late Friday. The teen's condition varied throughout the weekend but had taken a turn for the worse by Tuesday, according to BC provincial health officer Bonnie Henry.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/teen-in-critical-condition-with-canadas-first-human-case-of-h5-bird-flu/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/teen-in-critical-condition-with-canadas-first-human-case-of-h5-bird-flu/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32d3aa5000d46a3f4aea711a05230403cdfd67e79ec51505bd864f0c73618b96","category":"Tech"}
