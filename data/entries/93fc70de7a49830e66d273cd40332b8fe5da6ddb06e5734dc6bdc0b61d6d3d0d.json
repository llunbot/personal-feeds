And today we’ve got one: We found the AirPods Max for <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-Max-Space-Gray/509451094\">$399 at Walmart</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airpods-max-lightning-space-gray/6373460.p?skuId=6373460\">Best Buy</a> for delivery in time to wrap and put under the Christmas tree. That’s $150 off and only a couple of dollars off its all-time Black Friday low, a fantastic deal for a killer pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max are some of the most comfortable headphones you can get and they deliver fantastic audio. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">We gave them a four-star rating</a> when we reviewed them and stressed how pleasing the sound quality was, how great the active noise canceling is, and how awesome the build is. We weren’t thrilled about the price, but when you get to save $150 on them, that’s not really an issue anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The level of noise cancelation achieved by Apple with these headphones is pretty awesome, allowing you to block out the world around you, whether that’s a busy office or your upstairs neighbors remodeling their home. For all those moments when extra vigilance is required, the Transparency Mode will help you keep an ear on your surroundings without taking off your headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model has a Lightning port but otherwise is identical to the newer USB-C model other than some different colors. There’s actually one advantage to the Lightning model: you can connect a Lightning-to-3.5mm audio jack for wired listening, which isn’t available with USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you or someone you love has been wanting a pair of AirPods Max, you can grab a pair for a great price <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-Max-Space-Gray/509451094\">at Walmart</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airpods-max-lightning-space-gray/6373460.p?skuId=6373460\">Best Buy</a> and still get them in time to rock out on Christmas morning.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $150 on the AirPods Max</span><div><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-Max-Space-Gray/509451094\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Walmart</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"93fc70de7a49830e66d273cd40332b8fe5da6ddb06e5734dc6bdc0b61d6d3d0d","category":"Apple"}
