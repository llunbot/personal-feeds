While most of Apple’s major devices have made the switch to USB-C, Apple still has Lightning accessories. But according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/shopping/everything-apple-plans-to-launch-at-oct-30-scary-fast-mac-event/ar-AA1iWwyv&amp;xcust=1-1-2118888-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mac accessories will be making the switch on Monday</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman reports that it is “likely” that new versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad will be rolled out as part of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2114818/apple-scary-fast-event-m3-imac-macbook-pro.html\">Apple’s “Scary Fast” event on Monday, October 30</a>. These input devices will “ditch the old Lightning ports” and have USB-C connectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman’s mention of this change is one sentence in his article. He doesn’t say if Apple will offer new designs or features–or if Apple will move the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/626532/magic-mouse-charging-upside-down-why.html\">Magic Mouse’s port out from underneath the device</a>. We’re betting on Apple simply replacing the Lightning port and nothing else, and not even mentioning it during Monday’s event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/200788/magic-mouse.html\">Magic Mouse was introduced in 2009</a> and it used a pair of AA batteries and a removable battery cover. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/226607/apple-magic-mouse-2-review-mouse-unable-to-conjure-up-any-innovation.html\">Apple revised it in 2015</a> with a built-in rechargeable battery that is sealed into the mouse and charged through a Lighting port built into the underside of the device. The current Mac Magic Keyboard was released in 2021 with support for Touch ID. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/226613/apple-magic-trackpad-2-review-solid-performer-doesnt-feel-essential.html\">current Magic Trackpad</a> was released in 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s “Scary Fast” event will likely feature new Macs, including the iMac and MacBook Pro. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2115106/scary-fast-mac-event-m3-imac-macbook-pro.html\">Get more details on what we expect to see at the event</a>.
