{"title":"Ibis Introduces 2025 Ripley Gen 5","link":"https://theradavist.com/2025-ibis-ripley-v5/","date":1721156558000,"content":"<p>Pairing with today’s launch of the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ibis-ripmo-v3-first-ride-review\" target=\"_blank\">third-generation Ripmo</a>, Ibis is releasing the fifth iteration of the Ripley. In fact they’re more than just a pair…<span></span></p>\n<p>The Ripmo and Ripley share the same front and rear triangle, along with most of the pivot hardware. Aside from how each bike will be specced, the only thing separating the two is their rear shock stroke and dimensions, and the wishbone that drives them. That means that, down the road, you could technically swap from one configuration to the other. It also means that the new Ripley is a little more aggressive than it used to be. So, let’s get into it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1151\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-20-Medium.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-20-Medium.jpg?w=1151&amp;quality=75 1151w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-20-Medium.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1151\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-3-Medium.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-3-Medium.jpg?w=1151&amp;quality=75 1151w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-3-Medium.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Until now, the Ripley has ben a 120mm rear-travel, 130mm front-travel affair. This new Ripley bumps that up to 130 rear and 140 front, and naturally, the chassis is beefed up a little to suit the augmented ambitions. It’s also got a more modern-looking straight top tube, and everyone’s favorite doo-dad, in-frame storage. And like the Ripmo, the new Ripley has a flip chip meant to convert it to a mixed-wheel configuration. Although the longer-travel Ripmo will ship mixed-wheel in sizes small and medium, the Ripley is 29-only across all sizes. But that won’t stop riders who want a little more butt clearance, or a little more whip-a-bility from going mixed on their own.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Geo-Chart.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Geo-Chart.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Geo-Chart.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Geo-Chart.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Geo-Chart.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Ripley comes in five sizes. Small, medium, <em>extra medium,</em> large and extra large. If you’re considering a Ripley for yourself, look closely at the sizing. Reach numbers have increased significantly across the board, but so have seat tube angles. They’re size-specific now, increasing as frame size increases. Same goes for chainstay length and bottom-bracket height. Ibis took a refreshingly whole-body approach to fit on the new Ripley and Ripmo.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1151\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-21-Medium.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-21-Medium.jpg?w=1151&amp;quality=75 1151w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-21-Medium.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1151\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-5-Medium.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-5-Medium.jpg?w=1151&amp;quality=75 1151w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ibis-Ripley-V5-Blue-5-Medium.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>It’s clear there was a lot of thought put into these updates. There had to be, since the fourth-generation Ripley already was quite the machine. But the fifth-generation version is dotted with meaningful touches. Like the 34.9 mm seat tube diameter, which can make for smoother-acting, longer-lasting dropper posts. Or the loam guard protecting the lower link. Or the sustainability-focused frame bags made by Cotopaxi. It’s quite the package, and Ibis packaged it nicely with some thoughtful build kits.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ripley-V5-Pricing.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ripley-V5-Pricing.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ripley-V5-Pricing.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ripley-V5-Pricing.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Ripley-V5-Pricing.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>We’re happy to see all the cable-actuated builds are full Shimano, with a pretty impressive Deore build at $5,000. And all Ripleys come with Factory-level Fox Float rear shocks, and Ibis’s own fancy, wide aluminum Black Bird send wheelset. Then at the other end, there are AXS Transmission builds, toping out at $8,200. We’ll be getting one of them in over the next few months, so stay tuned for our ride impressions once we’ve gotten some time on it.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.ibiscycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ibis</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2025-ibis-ripley-v5/\">Ibis Introduces 2025 Ripley Gen 5</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"68741e202d4b0c565a9edff776aa89dca71539c32ce2fb2f8eedfa780d1d2e76","category":"Cycling"}
