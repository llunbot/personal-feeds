For all this, we are truly sorry,\" reads the letter, signed by the CEOs of developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive. \"When we’ve made statements like this one before, it’s included a pledge to keep making improvements, and while we are working on these updates, they haven’t happened at a speed or magnitude that is acceptable, and it pains us that we've now lost the trust of many of you. We want to do better.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018726#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7b8b7e8ea86d9e8ea4c1725f4d56880601aeb2d73790de90db66e0fc08ac5137","category":"Tech"}
