He wore a blaze orange trucker hat with the message “Buy me brunch.” I remember it well. Sadly, I still haven’t bought him brunch. Over the past three years, I’ve enjoyed his Instagrammed visits to derelict vehicles to rescue old car parts from an unceremonious death in the compactor. Even as I write this, his Instagram story contains him finding an identical RAV4 in a junkyard and all the parts he harvested from it. He also found a dirt bike abandoned far into Eastern Washington’s desert mountains. The whole salvage mission can be found on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNG3Au2dVD0\">YouTube</a>, along with many of his other entertaining curations like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cDUBGLgxOs\">Atmospheric River Rats</a>. The thought of photographing his Gary Fisher was planted on one of Bellingham’s bike nights, during which I watched him launch it over some playground equipment. At long last, I am proud to present Logan alongside his 1999 Toyota RAV4 and Gary Fisher Aquila.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-39.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>A Short Detour: The History of Japanese Mini Utility Vehicles</h3>\n<p>In the ’90s, there were various small off-road-capable utility vehicles on offer. Suzuki and Chevy teamed up to create the Sidekick and Geo Tracker. They were essentially the same vehicles, but you could have a Japanese or American badge. Honda released the CRV, which stands for “Comfortable Runabout Vehicle.” It featured a picnic table instead of a traditional trunk floor, a quirk that remained even through the model’s second generation. To this day, I think that is the funniest, most practical feature and the most fabulous name to be bestowed on a vehicle. Toyota’s answer to this market demand was the RAV4, a “Recreational Active Vehicle with 4-wheel drive.” Typical for Toyota, this name is decidedly less cute than Honda’s. Since then, the Sidekick and Geo Tracker have stopped being produced, and the RAV4 and CRV have become rather bland crossovers devoid of personality and quirks. This is why the first-generation models of these vehicles are now so celebrated.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-32.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-32.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-53.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-53.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-53.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-53.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The first-generation Toyota RAV4 is a superbly simple vehicle with just enough capability to make it a dark horse off-roader. It features a full-time all-wheel-drive system that splits power equally between the front and rear axles. The center locking differential can be engaged when driving off-road to keep that 50-50 power split going between the axles even when one wheel leaves the ground. Suspension comes in the form of independent wishbone suspension, both front and rear. This makes for incredibly active suspension, something I noticed as we drove up the forest service roads outside Bellingham. Though the road was rough, the ride was remarkably smooth, as each wheel could move without applying input to the other. For a vehicle not designed as a rock crawler, this is perfect. The 5-speed manual transmission provides plenty of feedback and control. The 3S-FE 4-cylinder motor produces 119 horsepower from two liters of displacement. This is plenty to propel the featherweight vehicle it’s attached to. Aside from air conditioning, there are few modern amenities like power windows, ABS, or electronic off-road features like traction control. It does have cruise control, which is nice. In the modern era of dashboards that resemble the TV section of a department store and engine bays that appear to require a degree in electrical engineering to understand, the stripped-down and discernible disposition of the first-generation RAV4 is a breath of fresh PNW pine.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-56.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-56.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-56.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>On the way to this shoot, Logan and I discussed the current state of the car world. We concluded that there genuinely aren’t any vehicles currently being released (at least here in the United States market) that compare to the first RAV4, especially the two-door model. Some small, off-road-style cars are being released, but it feels like they all fall short somehow. Or they all do too much. The Subaru Crosstrek is reasonably capable, but it uses a traction control system that doesn’t give the same feeling as a purely mechanical drivetrain while feeling more suburban than the 1999 RAV4. Its appearance doesn’t give off the same adaptability, which is confirmed by its break-over, approach angle, and departure angle. Much like the geometry of a bicycle, these measurements inform what kind of terrain a vehicle can handle. Toyota’s current fifth iteration of the RAV4 and Ford’s Bronco Sport are similar: overly complicated for what could be small, utilitarian vehicles. The original RAV4 got it right: lockers before lights.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-30.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Getting the RAV4 Right for Bellingham</h3>\n<p>Logan bought his RAV4 with a multitude of issues. The interior was moldy, the alignment was off, and the bumpers were dented. All of those issues have been fixed, upgraded, and rendered irrelevant. It even got new rod bearings, which caused a delay in this photographic expedition. Thanks to Logan’s care, it now rides stellar. He’s made a few modifications to make this already-capable rig more suited towards a dirt-focused lifestyle. He replaced the stock daytime-running lights with fog lights. This required sanding down the OEM lenses and rewiring the light harness to perform turn signal functionality.</p>\n<p>Additionally, he added air-lift bags to the rear suspension to aid in carrying the load of his motorcycle or a few bikes. He routed the valve for this system into the gas cap hatch, which makes it appear he is pumping air into his gas tank when leveling out the ride. This adds the benefit of some pre and post-bike ride chuckles. While replacing the moldy carpet, he also added extra sound-deadening material. Some of the leftovers now line the bonnet to quiet the beast that lies below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-44.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Logan’s Gary Fisher Aquila</h3>\n<p>Like his RAV4, Logan’s Gary Fisher Aquila is perfect. Its period is correct for the car and, similarly to the RAV4, tastefully and subtly modified. John Watson would disagree, but I find these ’90s MTBs far more interesting when coupled with recently modern conveniences, like single chainrings and derailleurs with clutches. The 11-speed SLX drivetrain is still one of my favorites. Much like a locking differential, it does the job without electronic whizz-bang fanfare. A basket and some tubes do cargo duties, while drinks are available in the canned or bottled variety. I need a bike like this in my life.</p>\n<p>A big thanks to Logan for the fun and for keeping such a pleasant vehicle alive and well.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_Radical_Rigs_Logan_Nelson_Rav4_Gary_fisher-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>1999 Toyota RAV4</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Model code: XA10</li>\n<li>2.0 L 3S-FE motor (inline-four cylinder, single-cam, 16 valves)</li>\n<li>89 kW (119 hp) and 179 Nm (132 ft-lb) of torque</li>\n<li>5-speed manual transmission</li>\n<li>Full-time four-wheel drive with selectable locking center differential</li>\n<li>Front and rear Independent wishbone suspension</li>\n<li>Years Produced: 1994-2000</li>\n<li>Wheelbase: 2,200 mm (86.6 in)</li>\n<li>Length: 3,740–3,750 mm (147.2–147.6 in)</li>\n<li>Width: 1,695 mm (66.7 in)</li>\n<li>Height: 1,646–1,661 mm (64.8–65.4 in)</li>\n<li>Curb weight: 1251 kg (2758 lbs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/radical-rigs-logan-nelsons-1999-toyota-rav4-and-gary-fisher-aquila/\">Radical Rigs: Logan Nelson’s 1999 Toyota RAV4 and Gary Fisher Aquila</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"2c5214a3db523e603558729aa120c48de72b5839b2d96a8a0351c27eb6ba2e53","category":"Cycling"}
