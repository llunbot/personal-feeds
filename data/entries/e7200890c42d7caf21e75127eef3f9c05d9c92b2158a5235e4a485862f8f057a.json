[…]</p>\n\n<p>The ruling imposes new limits on free speech in the former British\ncolony. Pro-democracy activists and human rights groups have also\ncriticised the decision to deny Tong bail and a jury trial, which\nhave been key features of Hong Kong’s rule of law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is utterly unsurprising, but crushing nonetheless.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/27/hong-kong-security-law\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e7200890c42d7caf21e75127eef3f9c05d9c92b2158a5235e4a485862f8f057a","category":"Tech"}
