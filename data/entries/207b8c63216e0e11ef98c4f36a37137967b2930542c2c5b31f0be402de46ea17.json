Riley Sheehan, Israel-Premier Tech</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Last autumn, American Riley Sheehan pulled off one of the least expected victories all season, winning Paris-Tours while being a stagiaire with Israel-Premier Tech. Unsurprisingly, he </span><span>was snapped up</span><span> on a three-year contract.</span></p>\n<p><span>The 24-year-old, son of former pro Clark, has impressed at more one-day races this season – third at the WorldTour event Eschborn-Frankfurt in May and fourth at Tro-Bro Léon a few days after – and thrives on those lumpy days that don’t bring the mountain climbers out to play. Expect to see him infiltrate many a breakaway on what will be his first Grand Tour.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"207b8c63216e0e11ef98c4f36a37137967b2930542c2c5b31f0be402de46ea17","category":"Cycling"}
