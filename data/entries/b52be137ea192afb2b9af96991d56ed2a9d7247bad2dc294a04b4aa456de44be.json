Users of Meta's ad platform who followed that advice have been getting burned by an AI-powered ad purchasing system, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24141585/meta-ai-advantage-plus-automated-ad-glitch-cpm\">The Verge</a>. The idea was to use a Meta-developed AI to automatically set up ads and spend your ad budget, saving you the hassle of making decisions about your ad campaign. Apparently, the AI funnels money to Meta a little too well: Customers say it burns, though, what should be daily ad budgets in a matter of hours, and costs are inflated as much as 10-fold.</p>\n<p>The AI-powered software in question is the \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1362234537597370\">Advantage+ Shopping Campaign</a>.\" The system is supposed to automate a lot of ad setup for you, mixing and matching various creative elements and audience targets. The power of AI-powered advertising (Google has a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/report-google-ads-restructure-could-replace-some-sales-jobs-with-ai/\">similar product</a>) is that the ad platform can get instant feedback on its generated ads via click-through rates. You give it a few guard rails, and it can try hundreds or thousands of combinations to find the most clickable ad at a speed and efficiency no human could match. That's the theory, anyway.</p>\n<p>The Verge spoke to \"several marketers and businesses\" with similar stories of being hit by an AI-powered spending spree once they let Meta's system take over a campaign. The description of one account says the AI \"had blown through roughly 75 percent of the daily ad budgets for both clients in under a couple of hours\" and that \"the ads’ CPMs, or cost per impressions, were roughly 10 times higher than normal.\" Meanwhile, the revenue earned from those AI-powered ads was \"nearly zero.\" The report says, \"Small businesses have seen their ad dollars get wiped out and wasted as a result, and some have said the bouts of overspending are driving them from Meta’s platforms.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020445#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020445&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b52be137ea192afb2b9af96991d56ed2a9d7247bad2dc294a04b4aa456de44be","category":"Tech"}
