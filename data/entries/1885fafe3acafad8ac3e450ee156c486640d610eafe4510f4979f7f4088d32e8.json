{"title":"Apple Stores Getting Tool for Updating AirPods Pro to Latest Firmware Version","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/10/apple-airpods-firmware-updater-tool/","date":1639189984000,"content":"Starting early next week, Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers will gain access to a new AirPods Firmware Updater diagnostic tool for updating AirPods Pro to the latest firmware, according to an internal memo obtained by MacRumors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Pro-Firmware-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tool will allow technicians with access to Apple Service Toolkit 2 to download the latest firmware on a customer's AirPods Pro in certain scenarios, such as if one of the customer's left or right AirPods Pro failed to update, the customer is using a non-iOS device, or the customer received replacement AirPods Pro with a different firmware version than the AirPod and/or charging case that they still had in their possession.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple lists the tool as being compatible with AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case or a MagSafe charging case. It's unclear if the tool will work with any other AirPods models, such as the recently released third-generation AirPods.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe tool is necessary because there is no manual way for customers to update the firmware on their AirPods. In general, AirPods connected to an iPhone or iPad <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/update-airpods/\">should automatically update to the latest firmware</a> after a fairly short period of time, and it may help to keep the AirPods in their charging case and connected to a power source.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs of now, the AirPods Firmware Updater will be for Apple's internal use only, with no indication that the tool will be released to the public. Twitter account @StellaFudge was first to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StellaFudge/status/1469402228352032774\">share information about the tool</a> earlier today.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple is launching an AirPods Firmware Updater tool! After all these years of waiting its coming!<br /><br />There's a catch though.<br /><br />It's only available to Apple Technicians. It's also only intended for people who use AirPods with non-Apple stuff, or AirPods that got mismatched firmware.</p>â€” Stella - Fudge (@StellaFudge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StellaFudge/status/1469402228352032774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 10, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/\">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/10/apple-airpods-firmware-updater-tool/\">Apple Stores Getting Tool for Updating AirPods Pro to Latest Firmware Version</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stores-getting-tool-for-updating-airpods-pro-to-latest-firmware-version.2327031/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3GBs-27iyoA:gIEzeMvAqrQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3GBs-27iyoA:gIEzeMvAqrQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1885fafe3acafad8ac3e450ee156c486640d610eafe4510f4979f7f4088d32e8","category":"Apple"}
