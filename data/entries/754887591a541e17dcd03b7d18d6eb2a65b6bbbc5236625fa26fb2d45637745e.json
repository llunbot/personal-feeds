Apple released the ‌iPhone 13‌ in late 2021 and has bumped it down in price since then to make it more accessible as new models have been released.

It contains the A15 Bionic chip, which is still widely available across Apple's lineup of devices and offers more than sufficient performance. With ‌Touch ID‌, wireless charging, water resistance, a capable rear camera, and the latest version of iOS, it is a great smartphone for those new to the ‌iPhone‌ and have basic needs. Some users value the more traditional design, Home Button, and size of the ‌iPhone SE‌ compared to the ‌iPhone 13‌, but there is no escaping the fact that the ‌iPhone SE‌ offers an older and more basic ‌iPhone‌ experience with a design dating back to 2014's ‌iPhone‌ 6.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor $170 more, the ‌iPhone 13‌ offers a decidedly more modern and advanced smartphone experience thanks to a much more modern design and a brighter, OLED display, as well as ‌Face ID‌, an Ultra Wide camera, Cinematic mode, Night mode, considerably better front-facing and rear cameras, ‌MagSafe‌, and longer battery life. There is also the benefit of improved water resistance, the ultra wideband chip for Precision Finding with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, and Dolby Atmos audio playback. There are even additional color options to choose from. All of this makes for a significant upgrade over the ‌iPhone SE‌ if you can afford the $170 extra, but it is worth bearing in mind that they are not essential capabilities for many users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone SE‌ is an excellent device if your needs or budget are limited, but there is no doubt that the ‌iPhone 13‌'s larger display, more modern and durable design, brighter OLED display, better cameras, longer battery life, and ‌MagSafe‌ compatibility are universally beneficial. In most cases, this is worth the $170 extra if you can afford it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also worth noting that the next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, which is not expected to launch until 2025, is expected to be based on the ‌iPhone 13‌'s all-screen design. This means that buying an ‌iPhone 13‌ is also likely to be a much more future-proof purchase, looking reasonably up to date compared to Apple's other devices in the coming years.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13/\">iPhone SE vs. iPhone 13 Buyer's Guide: Comparing Apple's Cheapest iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13-buyers-guide-comparing-apples-cheapest-iphones.2406264/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"754887591a541e17dcd03b7d18d6eb2a65b6bbbc5236625fa26fb2d45637745e","category":"Apple"}
