Availability first began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-us/\">in the U.S.</a>, Canada, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/\">some European countries</a> in July.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nThe refurbished model is discounted by around 15% in each country. For example, pricing is set at $119 in Australia, down from $139 brand new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOriginally released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on/\">in November 2023</a>, the lower-cost Apple Pencil has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2 and Apple Pencil Pro, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing with a USB-C cable. It attaches magnetically to any iPad with a USB-C port, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing. It also lacks pressure sensitivity and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says its refurbished products undergo full functionality testing, and are subject to a thorough cleaning process and inspection. The refurbished Apple Pencils are repackaged in a plainer white box with a refurbished label.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-in-more-countries/\">USB-C Apple Pencil Now Available Refurbished in Three More Countries</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/usb-c-apple-pencil-now-available-refurbished-in-three-more-countries.2438349/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"90dd9061638a6e716e2bc8d6846b58783ab0a88b80706de751b9af0b17f32975","category":"Apple"}
