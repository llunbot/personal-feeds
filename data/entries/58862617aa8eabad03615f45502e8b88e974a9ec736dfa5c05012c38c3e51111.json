{"title":"Avoid Getting Pulled Over with New Kuat Piston Pro X License Plate Mount","link":"https://bikerumor.com/kuat-piston-pro-x-license-plate-mount-obscured-plate/","date":1680792924000,"content":"<p>Anecdotally, it seems fairly unlikely that you’ll get pulled over if the bikes on your bike rack obscure your license plate. Technically though, many states have laws on the books that make it illegal for any object to even partially cover your plate – so if the police were looking for a reason to pull you over, they could. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that would rather avoid any potential hassle with the law, Kuat just introduced the newest accessory for the awesome Piston Pro X. Their new License Plate Mount is just that: a place to mount an external license plate to the end of your bike rack. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kuat-license-plate-installation.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter-800x539.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter-800x539.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter-297x200.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter-120x81.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter-768x517.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter-1536x1034.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kuat-License-plate-adapter.jpg 1552w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to mount under the end cap, installation is striaght forward and the mount pivots so the plate is visible when the rack is up or down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Machined from billet aluminum, the adapter is black anodized to match the rack, and it will sell for $49. License Plate Mounts will begin shipping in May, 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://shop.kuat.com/License-Plate-Mount-Adaptor\" target=\"_blank\">kuat.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kuat-piston-pro-x-license-plate-mount-obscured-plate/\">Avoid Getting Pulled Over with New Kuat Piston Pro X License Plate Mount</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"58862617aa8eabad03615f45502e8b88e974a9ec736dfa5c05012c38c3e51111","category":"Cycling"}
