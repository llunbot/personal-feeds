And the speakers on stage for the second day of Rouleur Live reflected just that. However, kicking off proceedings was Carolin Schiff and Liam Yates, who both like to ride on the rough stuff but, to each of them, gravel means different things, one racing, the other exploring. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Hannah Walker was joined on stage by prolific champion, Annemiek van Vleuten, a woman who has dominated and transformed the Women’s WorldTour over her career. Later on in the evening, all three of the women’s Paris-Roubaix winners, Elisa Longo Borghini, Lizzie Deignan and Alison Jackson, joined <em>Rouleur</em> writer Rachel Jary to speak about the iconic Hell of the North race. Olympic legend, Sir Chris Hoy, then took the audience from the Roubaix cobbles to the wooden track of the velodrome to speak about Team GB’s domination on the track with Matt Stephens. </span></p>\n<p><span>Beyond the main stage, people were testing their own efforts by taking part in Zwift’s racing on The Other Stage – attracting a lot of spectators and cheering fans as people pounded the pedals for a monumental win in the world of Watopia. Scott also had some of its pros and ambassadors on its stand, including Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team rider Carl Fredrik Hagen and team manager Doug Ryder, as well as Italian legend Vincenzo Nibali. </span></p>\n<p><span>See some of the highlights from day two of Rouleur Live: </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RL_23_-_AvV_Stage_3rd_Nov-_by_Alessandra_Bucci-5627.jpg?v=1699036556\" /></span><span>Annemiek van Vleuten received a special gift on stage from Rouleur </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RL_23_-_Stands_-_by_Alessandra_Bucci-5734.jpg?v=1699036689\" /></span><span>Matej Mohorič signing a Bahrain-Victorious jersey</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RL_23_-_Ribble_bikes_-_by_Alessandra_Bucci-4814.jpg?v=1699001159\" /></span><span>Limited edition Ribble Vic Lee Alloy E </span> <img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Rouleur_Live-1915.jpg?v=1699038404\" />The three women's Paris-Roubaix winners, Lizzie Deignan, Elisa Longo Borghini, and Alison Jackson </p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Rouleur_Live-1971.jpg?v=1699037196\" /></span><span>People enjoying the stage talks </span> <img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RL_23_-_Zwift_-_by_Alessandra_Bucci-5942_3cdaedef-2eaa-4d5a-96fc-e37a9e78d1e3.jpg?v=1699037597\" />There were some hard efforts going down in the Zwift racing </p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RL_23_-_Zwift_-_by_Alessandra_Bucci-5960.jpg?v=1699038517\" /></span><span>The Zwift racing was certainly drawing in the crowd </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Rouleur_Live-2302.jpg?v=1699038566\" /></span><span>Teammates Fred Wright and Matej Mohorič on stage with <em>Rouleur</em> editor Edward Pickering</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RL_23_-_Stands_-_by_Alessandra_Bucci-5721.jpg?v=1699038686\" />YouTuber Gee Milner building a dream bike at the FSA stand  </p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"4f9ac16ce5144a80469d08a7712816dead6fcf0d438f8a1b7e603cadada882dd","category":"Cycling"}
