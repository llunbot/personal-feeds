For $1000 No. 22 gives you the full-coverage Titanium Fenders in the standard raw ti finish – in either Road or Gravel widths. Anodizing adds $100 extra, polishing adds $200. And custom Cerakote and ano colors will bring the cost of your bespoke ti fenders up to $1500. But can you really put a price on beauty &amp; functionality? (Yes, you can. And it’s a high price!) </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No-22-Bicycle-Co-full-coverage-1000-dollar-custom-Titanium-bike-fenders_all-road-commuter-bike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No-22-Bicycle-Co-full-coverage-1000-dollar-custom-Titanium-bike-fenders_all-road-commuter-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"No. 22 full-coverage $1000 custom Titanium bike fenders, commuter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No-22-Bicycle-Co-full-coverage-1000-dollar-custom-Titanium-bike-fenders_all-road-commuter-bike-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No-22-Bicycle-Co-full-coverage-1000-dollar-custom-Titanium-bike-fenders_all-road-commuter-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No-22-Bicycle-Co-full-coverage-1000-dollar-custom-Titanium-bike-fenders_all-road-commuter-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No-22-Bicycle-Co-full-coverage-1000-dollar-custom-Titanium-bike-fenders_all-road-commuter-bike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The No. 22 custom Titanium Fenders are made to order, and then have about a 12-week lead time at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"No. 22 Bicycle Company Reactor Aero custom 3d-printed ti titanium road bike, complete bike at MADE\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/No22-Bicycle-Co-Reactor-Aero-custom-3d-printed-titanium-road-bike_MADE-photo-by-Dylan-van-Weelden_complete-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by Dylan van Weelden/No. 22)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Btw, if you want that custom Reactor Aero road bike, it sells for $10,000-15,000 just for the frameset.
