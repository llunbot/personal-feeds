The company is reducing the frequency of some employee bonuses, limiting hiring, and choosing not to replace some employees who have left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-14/apple-delays-bonuses-for-some-divisions-as-it-scrutinizes-costs-aapl&amp;xcust=1-1-1659568-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> reporter Mark Gurman, citing “people with knowledge of the situation … (who) asked not to be identified because the plan hasn’t been announced publicly,” writes that a belt-tightening operation began last July in response to rising inflation and fears of recession, but that this is now expanding and deepening. Not without reason: Apple’s revenues were <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1501590/apple-q1-2023-loss-iphone-mac-sales.html\">down 5 percent year-on-year</a> over the holiday period amid iPhone production problems and soft Mac demand, and are forecast to be down again in the current period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re being very prudent and thoughtful on spending,” CEO Tim Cook said at a shareholder meeting last week, “and we continue to be very deliberate when it comes to hiring.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman notes that cost-cutting measures at Cupertino have included a reduction in travel budgets, an increase in executive spending oversight, and some layoffs of contract workers; even Cook himself has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/12/tim-cook-pay-cut-earnings/&amp;xcust=1-1-1659568-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">taken a pay cut</a>. But it’s worth emphasizing that Apple has generally avoided the severe cuts seen at other tech companies: as the Macalope <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1481696/macalope-layoffs-microsoft-amazon-google-meta.html\">reported</a> earlier this year, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Spotify, and many other tech giants have recently resorted to mass layoffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly this may be because of Cook’s cautious tendencies as a CEO: Apple rarely extends itself as much as rivals during sales booms, which means less need for retrenchment during lean times. But it’s also fair to say that “lean times” is a relative term. During that supposedly disappointing quarterly report, Apple noted that its services division alone, big enough to be a high-ranking Fortune 500 company in its own right, broke the $20 billion mark in revenues for the first time. (Intel as a whole made $14 billion in its most recent quarter; Netflix made less than $8 billion.) The iPad division was up by 30 percent, and the company was still wildly profitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while Apple is clearly taking matters seriously, it would be a mistake to think the company is in trouble.</p>\n\nApple</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2be43f47f9fc85841ba8d3f59ab17e1760a41152aec97d189cac2b845e75b43c","category":"Apple"}
