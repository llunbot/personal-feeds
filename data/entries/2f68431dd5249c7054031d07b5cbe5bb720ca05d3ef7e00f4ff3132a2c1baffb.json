[credit:\n                              Ahoyo                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Last month, the <em>Super Mario Maker</em> community was rocked by the shocking admission that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/the-super-mario-maker-community-faces-its-final-boss/\">the game's last uncleared level</a>—an ultra-hard reflex test named \"Trimming the Herbs\" (TTH)—had been secretly created and uploaded <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/super-mario-makers-final-boss-was-a-fraud-all-along/\">using the assistance of automated, tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) techniques</a> back in 2017. That admission didn't stop <em>Super Mario Maker</em> streamer Sanyx from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yvVJbji0U\">finally pulling off a confirmed human-powered clear of the level</a> last Friday, just days before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/wii-u-3ds-online-servers-to-shut-down-in-six-months/\">Nintendo's final shutdown of the Wii U's online servers</a> Sunday would have made that an impossibility.</p>\n<p>But while \"Trimming the Herbs\" itself was solved in the nick of time, the mystery of the level's creation remained at least partially unsolved. Before TTH creator Ahoyo admitted to his TAS exploit last month, the player community at large didn't think it was even <em>possible</em> to precisely automate such pre-recorded inputs on the Wii U.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>The first confirmed clear of Trimming the Herbs by a human. </p></div>\n<p>Now, speaking to Ars, Ahoyo has finally explained the console hacking that went into his clandestine TAS so many years ago and opened up about the physical and psychological motivations for the level's creation. He also discussed the remorse he feels over what ended up being a years-long fraud on the community, which is still struggling with frame-perfect input timing issues that seem inherent to the Wii U hardware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015151#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015151&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f68431dd5249c7054031d07b5cbe5bb720ca05d3ef7e00f4ff3132a2c1baffb","category":"Tech"}
