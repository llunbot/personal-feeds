Everyone agrees that carbon is bad. And everyone agrees it’s hard to get rid of; carbon dioxide lasts up to <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2915/the-atmosphere-getting-a-handle-on-carbon-dioxide/\">1,000 years</a> in the atmosphere. The world even has a common goal: keeping global temperatures from reaching <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-un-climate-report-all-is-not-well-but-all-is-not-lost/\">1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels</a>, the boundary set by the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>\n<p>But nations don’t agree on how we’ll get there: staving off the worst of climate change will require cutting carbon emissions <em>and</em> developing ways to pull them out of the atmosphere. Here are some of the options delegates will likely be discussing as COP26 continues.</p>\n<h2>The problem with net zero</h2>\n<p>You’ve probably heard of a sticky little concept known as net-zero emissions: if you put any carbon into the atmosphere, you have to take the same amount out. On Monday at COP26, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/india-surprises-cop26-climate-summit-2070-target-net-zero-emissions-n1282933\">announced</a> that his country would reach that goal by the year 2070. Earlier this year, President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/\">said</a> the United States would do the same by 2050, a goal the UK has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/britain-set-out-how-finance-can-help-meet-net-zero-goals-2021-11-02/\">also pledged</a> to achieve.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810840#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810840&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b28ed65607ebd1c0c9be9b9913c9146f686e09a83e08d318ffbec820315d9d6a","category":"Tech"}
