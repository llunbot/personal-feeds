In some of these cars, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> placed on the wireless charging pad would either not charge at all or start to charge and then stop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost of the complaints were from ‌iPhone 15‌ owners, and came after the iOS 17.1 update. General Motors said in November that it was aware of an issue and investigating the problem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the second charging-related bug fix that Apple has implemented in recent weeks. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/\">iOS 17.1.1 update</a> that came out in early November addressed an issue that caused some ‌iPhone 15‌ models charged in BMW vehicles to lose NFC functionality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2 is expected to see a public release next week. The update also adds the Journal app, a Translate Action button option for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, new features in Messages, Weather and Clock widgets, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/\">and more</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-wireless-charging-bug-fix/\">iOS 17.2 Fixes Bug Preventing Wireless Charging From Working in Some Vehicles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-fixes-bug-preventing-wireless-charging-from-working-in-some-vehicles.2412907/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b2e56dd6ea43f853d524bcf54b58eba7c2a7f8ad7f4505b7cfbfb451fc3746bc","category":"Apple"}
