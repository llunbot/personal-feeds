Grand Tour season is upon us, which kicked off on Sunday with the week-long <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-vuelta-femenina-preview\" target=\"_blank\">La Vuelta Femenina</a> and continues with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d‚ÄôItalia</a> starting next weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before that, Carlos Rodr√≠guez (Ineos Grenadiers) won the six-day Tour of Romandie with Bora-Hansgrohe duo Aleksandr Vlasov and Florian Lipowitz completing the podium. Dorian Godon (Decathlon-AG2R-La Mondiale) sprinted to victory on the last stage, adding to a successful season so far for the squad. Maybe it was a smart move to get rid of their infamous brown bib shorts (although I miss them).</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-vuelta-femenina\">How to watch the Vuelta Femenina 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-femenina-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the Vuelta Femenina 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-vuelta-femenina-preview\">La Vuelta Femenina 2024: Route, how to watch, start list and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Gaia Realini wears first <em>maillot rojo</em> of La Vuelta Femenina</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Gaia-Realini-at-La-Vuelta-Femenina-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Lidl-Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At La Vuelta Femenina, Lidl-Trek won the Stage 1 team time-trial to put Gaia Realini into the race-leader‚Äôs red jersey.

The scheduled 185km trip around farm roads and cobbles on Sunday 28th April had to be cancelled due to flooding after heavy rainfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A statement from the race organisers said, ‚ÄòFollowing discussions in line with the UCI extreme weather protocol, with the Organisation Commissaires Panel and representatives from teams and riders from Israel Premier Academy and Saint Piran discussing the safety and management of the route, it has reluctantly been decided to cancel the 2024 CiCLE Classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòThe decision has been taken after the best efforts of the organisation to design a reduced route, but significant flooding at different sections of the routes have sadly made this impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòThe race organisation wishes to convey their thanks to the team‚Äôs riders, officials, volunteers and supporters for the patience and understanding.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is the only time in the race‚Äôs 18-year history that it has been called off. Previous winners include Finn Crockett, who went on to win a road race bronze medal at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and three-time USA Criterium Champion Luke Lamperti who now rides for Soudal QuickStep. All received a huge pork pie from Melton Mowbray for their efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ronde de l‚ÄôIsard to award the Bjorg Lambrecht Trophy</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>In Memoriam Bjorg Lambrecht<br /><br />Cette 4√®me √©tape, avec l'arriv√©e √† Beille, aura une symbolique toute particuli√®re car ce sera l'√©tape sur laquelle le vainqueur se verra d√©cern√© le Troph√©e Bjorg Lambrecht qui avait remport√© l'√©tape √† l'arriv√©e de ce m√™me Plateau de Beille en 2017. <a href=\"https://t.co/YJpy4MuvAv\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/YJpy4MuvAv</a></p>‚Äî Ronde de l'Isard (@RondeIsard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RondeIsard/status/1784855078282686836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronde de l‚ÄôIsard, the U23 stage race from 1st to 5th May 2024, will award the Bjorg Lambrecht Trophy on Stage 4 atop the Plateau-de-Beille in France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bjorg Lambrecht won the race in 2016.
