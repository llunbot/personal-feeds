W. Walker Smith, now a graduate student at Indiana University, combined his twin passions of chemistry and music to create what he calls a new audio-visual instrument to communicate the concepts of chemical spectroscopy.</p>\n<p>Smith presented his data <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification\">sonification</a> project—which essentially transforms the visible spectra of the elements of the periodic table into sound—at a meeting of the American Chemical Society being held this week in Indianapolis, Indiana. Smith even featured audio clips of some of the elements, along with \"compositions\" featuring larger molecules, during a performance of his \"The Sound of Molecules\" show.</p>\n<p>As an undergraduate, \"I [earned] a dual degree in music composition and chemistry, so I was always looking for a way to turn my chemistry research into music,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX-GAWY2Svs&amp;list=PL-qHxGvFeZV1z1m5cYt9Wky8ai4fv7R-p&amp;index=1\">Smith said during a media briefing</a>. \"Eventually, I stumbled across the visible spectra of the elements and I was overwhelmed by how beautiful and different they all look. I thought it would be really cool to turn those visible spectra, those beautiful images, into sound.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927228#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927228&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"adc9b2aa9b38d561b2d0928fab72a148d93a5b445be447dca6698fbb382ddc4c","category":"Tech"}
