This time, the company is apparently slowing down the site for users it catches running an ad blocker. <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/01/13/youtube-new-wave-slow-downs-ad-blocker/\">9to5Google</a> spotted<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/195octe/youtube_started_slowing_video_buffer_with_adblock/\"> this Reddit thread</a> filled with users seeing poor loading performance with ad blockers enabled.</p>\n<p>A video at the top of the Reddit post shows what some users are seeing: A video with an ad blocker on can't load quickly enough to keep up with the playback speed (which isn't on normal; it's maybe 2x) and has to pause at around 30 seconds. Turning off the ad blocker immediately improves loading performance, with the white line on YouTube's progress bar showing significantly more buffering runway. Users report that the ad-block detection causes strange issues, like \"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/195octe/youtube_started_slowing_video_buffer_with_adblock/khonr7g/\">lag</a>\" that makes full screen or comments not work or Chrome being <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/195octe/youtube_started_slowing_video_buffer_with_adblock/kholz5p/\">unable to load</a> other webpages while YouTube is open.</p>\n<p>YouTube has used all sorts of tactics to get people to turn off ad blockers and subscribe to YouTube Premium. The company previously has been showing pop-up messages saying ad blockers violate YouTube terms of service. Earlier, the company was caught adding <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/17ywbjj/whenever_i_open_a_youtube_video_in_a_new_tab_its/k9w3ei4/?context=3\">a five-second delay</a> to the initial site load for ad blockers. The changes have kicked off a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/12/chromes-next-weapon-in-the-war-on-ad-blockers-slower-extension-updates/\">cat-and-mouse game</a> between Google/YouTube and the ad blocker community.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995877#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995877&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c43b5b9455e89f51782e62d8a96f4a67bc719ac973d91bd6b68417c2b6a0bfcd","category":"Tech"}
