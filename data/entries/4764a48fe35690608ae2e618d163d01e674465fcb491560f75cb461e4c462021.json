You can read how it made the process of acquiring compute resources simple, even though the stack running behind the scenes was incredibly complex.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/09/04/farewell-ec2-classic-certificate.png\" alt width=\"2744\" height=\"1860\" /></p> \n<p>We have come a long way since 2006, and we’re not done innovating for our customers. As celebrated in this year’s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/welcome-to-aws-storage-day-2023/\">AWS Storage Day</a>, Amazon EBS was launched 15 years ago this month. James Hamilton, SVP and distinguished engineer at Amazon, wrote <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/amazon-elastic-block-store-at-15-years/\">Amazon EBS at 15 Years</a>, about how the service has evolved to handle over 100 trillion I/O operations a day, and transfers over 13 exabytes of data daily.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/09/04/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-4.56.10-PM-2048x1151-1.png\" alt width=\"2048\" height=\"1151\" /></p> \n<p>As Dr. Werner said in his piece, “it’s a reminder that building evolvable systems is a strategy, and revisiting your architectures with an open mind is a must.” Our innovation efforts driven by customer feedback continue today, and this week is no different.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Last Week’s Launches</u></strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/08/amazon-managed-service-apache-flink/\"><strong>Renaming Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink</strong></a> – You can now use Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink, a fully managed and serverless service for you to build and run real-time streaming applications using Apache Flink.
