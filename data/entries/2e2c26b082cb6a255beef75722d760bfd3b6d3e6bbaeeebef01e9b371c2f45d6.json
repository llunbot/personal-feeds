Designed with hard plastic, Apple says the battery pack is able to wirelessly charge the iPhone at up to 5W on the go, or at up to 15W when the battery pack is connected to a 20W or higher power adapter with a Lightning to USB-C cable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMacRumors readers have indicated the MagSafe Battery Pack is 11mm thick and <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magsafe-battery-pack.2304308/post-30108697\">weighs around 114 to 115 grams</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tommyboiiiiii/status/1417336541249105922\">As noted by Tommy Boi on Twitter</a>, an iPhone 12 mini with the MagSafe Battery Pack attached weighs around 250 grams, which is heavier than the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which weighs 228 grams on its own.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>MagSafe Battery Pack UNBOXING üôèü§© <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9to5mac?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@9to5mac</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacRumors?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MacRumors</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacSparky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MacSparky</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macstoriesnet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@macstoriesnet</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKBHD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MKBHD</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iMore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@iMore</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@viticci</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ijustine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ijustine</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reneritchie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@reneritchie</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@markgurman</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/appleinsider?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@appleinsider</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/s1rpxpw3xV\">pic.twitter.com/s1rpxpw3xV</a></p>‚Äî Filip Bro≈æ (@Broz1k) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Broz1k/status/1417412381974712322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 20, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenrussell/status/1417184608001695747\">Steven Russell from Memphis, Tennessee confirmed</a> the MagSafe Battery Pack cannot be charged with Apple's MagSafe Charger or other Qi-based wireless charging pads. However, when attached to an iPhone 12 that is charging via Lightning, the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå can deliver power to the battery pack. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-reverse-charging/\">reverse wireless charging feature</a> requires a 20W or higher power adapter and you can track both charging statuses on the Lock screen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRussell also demonstrated that the MagSafe Battery Pack can wirelessly charge AirPods, but as expected, it cannot charge an Apple Watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>One more thing to add. I have been asked if it wirelessly charges AirPods.
