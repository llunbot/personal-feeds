Already in use on some Android smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy S21 Ultra, pixel binning merges data from multiple smaller pixels on the camera's image sensor into one \"super-pixel\" for improved low-light sensitivity. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPixel binning is beneficial because simply increasing a smartphone camera's megapixels while maintaining the same camera sensor size results in smaller pixels, which generally capture less light, leading to lower-quality low-light photos. Pixel binning would allow iPhone 14 Pro models to shoot high-resolution 48-megapixel photos in bright conditions and 12-megapixel photos in low-light conditions that are still of high quality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn the Galaxy S21 Ultra, the device shoots 12-megapixel photos by default, with a toggle available in the camera app for shooting 108-megapixel photos. This is ideal for most users, as high-resolution photos have large file sizes that can use up lots of storage space. A single 108-megapixel photo shot with the Galaxy S21 Ultra can have a 16MB file size, for example, compared to the average 12-megapixel photo being around 2-3MB.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>CNET</em>'s Stephen Shankland <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-s21-ultra-pixel-binning-adapts-photos-for-detail-or-the-dark/\">wrote a helpful explainer</a> that goes into more detail on the technical aspects of pixel binning earlier this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo expects the iPhone 14 Pro's new 48-megapixel Wide lens <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/\">to support 8K video recording</a>, up from 4K currently, and he said these high-resolution videos would be suitable for viewing on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/apple-headset-focus-on-gaming-media-communication/\">Apple's rumored AR/VR headset</a> expected to launch next year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo ultimately believes that the camera quality of the iPhone 14 Pro models will \"elevate mobile phone camera photography to a new level.\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/iphone-14-pro-pixel-binning-rumor/\">How the iPhone 14 Pro's Upgraded 48-Megapixel Camera is Expected to Work</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-the-iphone-14-pros-upgraded-48-megapixel-camera-is-expected-to-work.2327484/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=iGp5uRwJqIQ:YQJlGRpgjfo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=iGp5uRwJqIQ:YQJlGRpgjfo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ec7f7b39366634d544cf43a9c5237a51ee5d97e74ebe58d20a636a1566b486d","category":"Apple"}
