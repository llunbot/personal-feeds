Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic halted our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results.   </p>\n<p>Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/gone-racing-lachy-and-kenniths-cape-epic/\">Read More</a>","author":"rapha racing","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"43d6d5f4450b5d17bcdd71fd188268b47adccfbb812cb9d8f32e2e3f6159cec0","category":"Cycling"}
