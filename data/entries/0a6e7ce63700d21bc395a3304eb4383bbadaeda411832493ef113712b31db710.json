While it's impossible to predict the outcome with certainty, law professors speaking to Ars believe that ByteDance will have a strong First Amendment case in its lawsuit against the US.</p>\n<p>One reason for this belief is that just a few months ago, a US District Court <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/montanas-tiktok-ban-blocked-by-federal-judge/\">judge blocked</a> a Montana state law that attempted to ban TikTok. In October 2020, another federal judge in Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/judge-trump-admins-tiktok-ban-would-cause-irreparable-harm-to-creators/\">blocked</a> a Trump administration order that would have banned TikTok from operating inside the US. TikTok also <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.222257/gov.uscourts.dcd.222257.30.0_7.pdf\">won a preliminary injunction</a> against Trump in US District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2020.</p>\n<p>\"Courts have said that a TikTok ban is a First Amendment problem,\" Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman, who <a href=\"https://blog.ericgoldman.org/\">writes frequent analysis</a> of legal cases involving technology, told Ars this week. \"And Congress didn't really try to navigate away from that. They just went ahead and disregarded the court rulings to date.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020276#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020276&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a6e7ce63700d21bc395a3304eb4383bbadaeda411832493ef113712b31db710","category":"Tech"}
