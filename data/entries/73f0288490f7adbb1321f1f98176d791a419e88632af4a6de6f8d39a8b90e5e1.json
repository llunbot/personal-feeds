Foxconn plans to start mass producing the vehicle in April, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFoxconn said in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/foxconn-plant-in-the-united-states/\">August</a> that it plans to begin construction of all-electric vehicle plants in the United States and Thailand this year, with the aim of being operational by 2023. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Lordstown deal is one of Foxconn's biggest vehicle-related investments it has made over the past two years. Foxconn has yet to commercially release any vehicle following the debut of its EV platform last year, but its purchase of the Ohio plant means it won't have to build capacity from scratch, which could help the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> manufacturer in any attempt to court Apple's business if it enters the market, although that isn't expected for at least several years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is widely reported to be working on its own vehicle and is thought to be exploring the potential for third-party companies to help it launch the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a>. One report <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/11/apple-car-contract-manufacturers-possibility/\">vaguely referenced</a> Foxconn as a potential candidate for the ‌‌Apple Car‌‌'s production, but Apple is also looking at other possible suppliers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-car-battery-united-states/\">reportedly</a> wants to ensure that the battery used in the ‌‌Apple Car‌‌ is produced in the United States, and that sentiment could extend to other auto parts, which could work in Foxconn's favor if it's able to demonstrate proof to Apple of vehicle manufacturing expertise. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/apple-supplier-foxconn-ohio-car-factory/\">Apple Supplier Foxconn Agrees to Buy Ohio Car Factory for $230 Million</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supplier-foxconn-agrees-to-buy-ohio-car-factory-for-230-million.2314799/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4SrsYNcLJKY:DMBlQNxhRCk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4SrsYNcLJKY:DMBlQNxhRCk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4SrsYNcLJKY\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"73f0288490f7adbb1321f1f98176d791a419e88632af4a6de6f8d39a8b90e5e1","category":"Apple"}
