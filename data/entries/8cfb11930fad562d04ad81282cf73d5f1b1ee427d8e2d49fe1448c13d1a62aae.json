If you’re just a designer and sending some drawings to a company you’re hardly involved with, you lose your soul and lose the reason you are…’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So said Jean-Claude Chrétien, general manager of French bicycle manufacturer Look and part-time philosopher, when Cyclist visited the company’s frame manufacturing plant in Tunisia back in 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a sentiment that comes to mind on Cyclist’s latest visit to Look, this time at its headquarters in Nevers, a commune in central France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re here to discover the embodiment of that mastery of manufacturing – the historic bikes from Look’s collection that reveal the development of the brand and demonstrate its commitment to innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the bikes are beautiful, some are baffling, but all of them are groundbreaking in their own way. And it all started not with cycling, but with skiing. Look formed in 1951 as a ski-bindings manufacturer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The founder of Look, Jean Beyl, got the idea from his hospital bed after breaking his fibula skiing for the second time,’ explains Audrey Sogny, head of communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look would later sell its ski-bindings division to Skis Rossignol but, in 1984, it applied that spring-loaded binding technology to the world of two wheels, inventing the world’s first ‘automatic’ <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">clipless pedals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1985 Bernard Hinault became the first cyclist to win the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> using a pair of clipless pedals, and a year later the company entered the world of bicycle manufacturing, going on to make some of the most successful and eye-catching bikes in the history of the sport.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

prototype, so wasn’t a commercial offering. That said, the French track team used it for a while, although it didn’t gain long-term traction because it lacked rigidity,’ says Gilles Moutarde, Look’s after-sales service manager who has been with the company for 30 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘What inspired its development? Partly the summer of 1993 when world records were sent tumbling thanks to the efforts of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/graeme-obree-do-it-because-you-love-it\" target=\"_blank\">Graeme Obree</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/we-have-to-change-the-way-we-travel-for-good-chris-boardman-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Boardman</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘French track rider Philippe Ermenault [Pursuit World Champion in 1997 and 1998] and his team were convinced it was the design of the bike that was making the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘So Ermenault explained what he expected from the bike in detail. Jacky Mourioux, the national coach, guided our work, and aerodynamicist Maurice Menard helped us realise an exceptional “coefficient of penetration” through the air. From the first tests the times were prodigious, and Ermenault went on to win a competition in Aquitaine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As for its construction, it’s a carbon frame that lacks a traditional seat tube. But it’s the forks that really stand out. The designer had a background in the car industry and he felt this design would behave well at speed. It was also a test of what might work commercially and what wouldn’t.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Look KG 196, 1990</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04-970x523.jpg\" alt=\"classic_bikes_look_04\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04-970x523.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04-300x162.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04-768x414.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04-1536x828.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04-750x404.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04-1140x614.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180615/classic_bikes_look_04.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The KG 196 was a frame of firsts – it was our first monocoque carbon frame, our first integrated fork and first adjustable stem,’ says Moutarde. ‘That monocoque frame was a true groundbreaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘By forging a manufacturing process where you could create a carbon frame in a single mould, we increased rigidity, comfort and, of course, could produce a variety of shapes, which was key to aerodynamic evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That aerodynamic edge tipped over to the forks, too, which resulted in better handling characteristics while giving us the ability to narrow the frontal profile.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"837\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03-970x837.jpg\" alt=\"classic_bikes_look_03\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03-970x837.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03-300x259.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03-768x662.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03-1536x1325.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03-750x647.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03-1140x983.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/02180618/classic_bikes_look_03.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘You could also change the angle of the stem depending on your flexibility, and a final first for Look: internal routing throughout, rather than solely in the top tube as seen on previous models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Also note the Mavic Zap electronic groupset – the forerunner of Shimano’s Di2 – which provided electric changing on the rear derailleur only and featured on models post-1992.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The front remained mechanical using a cable.
