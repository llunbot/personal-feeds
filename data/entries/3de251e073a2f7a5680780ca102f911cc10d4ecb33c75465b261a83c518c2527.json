The third-generation iPhone SE is expected to be a major instrument in helping Apple establish a presence in the market segment for mid-range 5G smartphones. Its production volume for 2022 is forecasted to reach 25-30 million units.</blockquote>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously claimed that the new iPhone SE will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/\">similar design as the current model</a>, which is based on the iPhone 8, with a 4.7-inch display, Touch ID home button, and thicker bezels.
