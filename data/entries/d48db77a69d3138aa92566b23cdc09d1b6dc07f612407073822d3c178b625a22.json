{"title":"37signals’s Hey Is Finally for Sale (in the US) From Its iPhone App","link":"https://world.hey.com/dhh/hey-is-finally-for-sale-on-the-iphone-a08cb218","date":1748277119000,"content":"\n<p>David Heinemeier Hansson (last week):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thanks to their fight for Fortnite, app developers everywhere are\nnow allowed to link out of apps to their own web-based payment\nsystem in the US store (but, sadly, nowhere else yet).</p>\n\n<p>This is all we ever wanted from Apple: to have a way to distribute\nour iPhone apps and keep the customer relationship by billing\ndirectly. The 30% toll gets all the attention, and it is\nludicrously egregious, but to us, it’s just as much about\n<a href=\"https://www.hey.com/apple/iap/\">retaining that direct customer relationship</a>, so we can help\nfolks with refunds, so they don’t tie their billing for a\nmulti-platform email system to a single manufacturer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/judge-pressures-apple-to-approve-fortnite-or-return-to-court/\">Here’s Sarah Perez at TechCrunch</a>, the day prior to DHH’s announcement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Following the decision, Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/apple-changes-us-app-store-rules-to-let-apps-redirect-users-to-their-own-websites-for-payments/\">updated</a> its App Store\npolicies for the U.S., and apps, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/apple-approves-spotify-app-update-that-allows-u-s-users-to-access-pricing-info-external-payment-links/\">Spotify</a>, Amazon\n<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/amazon-kindles-ios-app-adds-new-get-book-button-following-apple-payments-ruling/\">Kindle</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/patreons-app-can-now-accept-web-payments-after-u-s-app-store-changes/\">Patreon</a> quickly rolled out new versions\nof their apps to take advantage of the new functionality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>None of these apps were using Apple’s in-app payments. Users simply couldn’t sign up for paid tiers (or in Kindle’s case, buy books) from inside the apps. This is a win for users, and Apple won’t lose a cent from commissions from any of these apps.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/26/hey-now-for-sale-from-iphone-app\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d48db77a69d3138aa92566b23cdc09d1b6dc07f612407073822d3c178b625a22","category":"Tech"}
