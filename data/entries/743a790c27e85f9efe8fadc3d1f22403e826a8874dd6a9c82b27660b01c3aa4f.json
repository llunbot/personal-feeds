{"title":"DPReview Is Working on Some Sort of ‘Archive’","link":"https://www.dpreview.com/news/0507902613/dpreview-closure-an-update","date":1681754208000,"content":"\n<p>Scott Everett, general manager of the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/22/amazon-layoffs-dpreview\">soon</a>-to-<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/23/coldeway-dpreview\">close</a> Amazon subsidiary DPReview:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’ve received a lot of questions about what’s next for the site.\nWe hear your concerns about losing the content that has been\ncarefully curated over the years, and want to assure you that the\ncontent will remain available as an archive.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve also heard that you need more time to access the site, so\nwe’re going to keep publishing some more stories while we work on\narchiving.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t understand either of these paragraphs. I mean, I’m glad they’re still publishing new content, but I don’t understand what publishing new stories has to do with giving readers more time to access the site. And it’s completely unclear what sort of “archive” is going to be available after it closes.</p>\n\n<p>What I’d really like to see is for Amazon to change its mind, and keep DPreview going. Or sell it to someone else who will. But if it’s going to close, the right way to “archive” it is simply to keep the site as-is and make it read-only. When you search for reviews of a specific camera model, DPReview’s articles are always at or near the top in the results. Keep those old URLs available, unchanged.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/17/dpreview-update\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"743a790c27e85f9efe8fadc3d1f22403e826a8874dd6a9c82b27660b01c3aa4f","category":"Tech"}
