Amazon has slashed prices on every model of the Apple Watch Series 8, with $120 off any color or combination you choose. Here are the highlights:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Starlight-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDJBG74R/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 8 (41mm, GPS): $280</a> (MSRP $399)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Starlight-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDJDH2WR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 8 (45mm, GPS): $310</a> (MSRP $429)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQQCFH/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 8 (41mm, Cellular): $380</a> (MSRP $499)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJGF88L/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 8 (45mm, Cellular): $410</a> (MSRP $529)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJFCZMG/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 8 (41mm, Cellular, Stainless Steel): $630</a> (MSRP $749)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJDKRYB/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 8 (45mm, Cellular, Stainless Steel): $680</a> (MSRP $799)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s $120 off on every model and the best price we’ve seen on any of them individually, let alone all of them at the same time. As far as features, here’s what’s standard across every model:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Always-On Retina display</li>\n\n\n\n<li>S8 SiP with 64-bit dual-core processor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3rd gen heart-rate, ECG, blood-oxygen, temperature sensors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WR50 water resistance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Always-on Altimeter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>18 hours of battery life</li>\n\n\n\n<li>watchOS 10 compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The differences between the models are minimal. The cellular models offer the options to connect to a wireless LTE network through your carrier (for a fee, usually $10 per month) for full iPhone independence, and the stainless steel models are slightly more luxurious than the standard aluminum ones. Otherwise, no matter which model you choose, you’re getting a great watch at a great price that will get updates for years to come.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f227baf1b1a8f72a77c06fcd2c74875a29fbf246f6ad81c30f1e6d255de729b1","category":"Apple"}
