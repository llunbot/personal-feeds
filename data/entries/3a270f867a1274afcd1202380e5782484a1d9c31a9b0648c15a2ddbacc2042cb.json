The effort would likely cost NASA between $8 billion and $11 billion, and the launch would be delayed at least two years until 2030, with samples getting back to Earth a few years later, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/msr-irb-report-final-copy-v3.pdf\">the review board concluded</a>.</p>\n<p>But that's not the whole story. Like all federal agencies, NASA faces new spending restrictions imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a bipartisan budget deal struck last year between the White House and congressional Republicans. With these new budget headwinds, NASA officials determined the agency's plan for Mars Sample Return would not get specimens from the red planet back to Earth until 2040.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017338#p3\">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017338&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3a270f867a1274afcd1202380e5782484a1d9c31a9b0648c15a2ddbacc2042cb","category":"Tech"}
