Vision says the 5D is the winningest handlebar in pro road racing – having been on the road race circuit for 9 years – and ridden to wins at all 3 Grand Tours and 5 Monuments. And now its new EVO evolution refines that popular race-winning carbon bar in a lighter, stiffer, more comfortable and faster 1-piece road bike cockpit. Oh, and it’s cheaper too!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vision Metron 5D EVO integrated carbon road cockpit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Around since mid-2016, the Vision Metron 5D was <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tpe16-fsa-continues-with-wider-afterburners-extralight-bars-and-stems-plus-visions-metron-5d-barstem-and-hydration-system/\" target=\"_blank\">an early adopter</a> of a complete 1-piece bar &amp; stem setup with internal routing in the pursuit of improved aerodynamic performance.
