Inside, clothing is created with passion and an unwavering commitment to sustainable cycling. This is the headquarters of Cima Coppi, a brand that has redefined cycling apparel by championing natural materials and an artisanal approach. Behind this venture are Lawrence and Patricia, a couple who have traveled a long road, both literally and figuratively, to get here.</p>\n<p>Walking into their workshop is nothing like visiting a large factory with conveyor belts and automated machines. It’s an intimate space, filled with an energy that can be felt in every garment they produce. Here, every thread tells a story, every stitch is the result of experience, and every decision is guided by a key question: how can we make cycling apparel without compromising the planet?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>A Journey That Began in Vancouver</h3>\n<p>The story of Cima Coppi began in 2008 in Vancouver, in a neighborhood with a strong Italian heritage. Lawrence, who had completed his studies in Industrial Design (2005) and a Master’s in Sustainable Development (2007), discovered wool almost by accident.</p>\n<p>During a fixed-gear bike journey from Sweden to Spain, carrying nothing but a wool sweater and Swedish army clothing, he realized something that would change his perspective on textiles: wool not only performed incredibly well for cycling but also didn’t require the plastics and chemicals used in conventional technical clothing.</p>\n<p>That was the seed of Cima Coppi. But it didn’t start with jerseys and bib shorts – the first item Lawrence ever sewed was a cycling cap, simply because he always wore one. Soon, his friends started asking for more, and he ended up selling them at cycling events and on the streets, using a folding table that he carried on his bike.</p>\n<p>Still, his vision went beyond caps. He wanted to create a complete cycling kit, from head to toe, made entirely from natural materials. But he faced a problem: his background in industrial design had given him little experience working with textiles. So he found the most logical solution: to learn from the best.</p>\n<p>In Vancouver’s Little Italy, he started visiting two Italian tailors, Angelo and Renzo, who had been working with suits for decades. Trading bottles of wine for fabric scraps and advice, Lawrence learned the fundamentals of traditional tailoring. It was Renzo who insisted on the name, a tribute to the highest peak of the Giro d’Italia and to the legendary Fausto Coppi: “<em>Cima Coppi, il meglio del meglio!</em>”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>From Canada to Spain: A New Beginning</h3>\n<p>In 2015, Lawrence and Patricia decided it was time for a change. Their suppliers were in Europe, Vancouver had become too expensive, and sustainability was at the core of their project. They moved to Spain and, using a map and a Venn diagram, chose Oviedo – a city where they could live without a car, access mountains easily, and establish their workshop without the pressures of mass production.</p>\n<p>The first years in Spain were filled with learning and growth. They moved their workshop three times, navigated the complexities of the Spanish textile industry, and tried to balance expansion with their philosophy of life. It wasn’t easy, but the COVID pandemic ended up reinforcing their business model.</p>\n<p>While other brands struggled with supply chain disruptions, Cima Coppi was not dependent on Asia or large inventories, but rather on small textile manufacturers and made-to-order production. Instead of collapsing, Cima Coppi strengthened its position and expanded its product range.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>An Alternative Cycling Culture</h3>\n<p>Cima Coppi isn’t for cyclists chasing marketing trends or petroleum-based materials that compromise sustainability solely for performance and speed.<br />\nTheir customers are mainly randonneurs, ultra-distance cyclists, and bikepackers – people who prioritize durability and functionality over fleeting trends. In a world where lycra and polyester dominate the peloton, Cima Coppi is committed to merino wool, Ventile cotton, and natural materials free of PFCs and harmful chemicals.</p>\n<p>Lawrence compares wool in cycling to steel in bicycles. Both materials have been replaced by lighter and more modern options, but their performance, reliability, and comfort remain unmatched in many situations. The problem is that people have forgotten, or never learned, how these materials truly work.</p>\n<p>Curiously, while some cyclists are surprised to hear that their jerseys are made of wool, elderly women in Asturian villages simply smile and say, “Of course, wool is the best!”. It’s a paradox that reflects how traditional knowledge of natural materials has been replaced by decades of synthetic marketing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-38.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-38.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Looking Ahead: Innovation Without Compromise</h3>\n<p>The future of Cima Coppi is not about becoming a large company, but continuing to do things the right way. Their goal isn’t mass production, but rather refining their approach to sustainability.</p>\n<p>They have started working with TMF Italia to develop chamois pads made from bio-based foams, a breakthrough in an industry still heavily dependent on petroleum. They have also perfected their Ventile cotton vest, proving that breathability and protection can coexist without synthetic membranes.</p>\n<p>But every new product is approached with patience. Lawrence refuses to launch anything unless he is absolutely certain of its quality and functionality. His philosophy is clear: “If a customer repeatedly complains about a product, the problem isn’t the customer—it’s the product.”</p>\n<p>That’s why, instead of designing collections two years in advance like major brands, Cima Coppi works in short cycles, continuously refining each garment based on real user feedback.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Cima_Coppi_Shop_Visit-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pedaling at Their Own Pace</h3>\n<p>As Lawrence and Patricia show me around the workshop and talk about their products, it’s easy to see that Cima Coppi is more than a brand – it’s a way of understanding cycling.</p>\n<p>A kind of cycling that is not dictated by large corporations or planned obsolescence, but by a real connection with the bike, materials, and the planet.</p>\n<p>In a market where sustainability has become just another marketing slogan, Cima Coppi continues to prove that cycling apparel can be made without shortcuts or compromises.</p>\n<p>They are not trying to be the biggest, just the most consistent. And in a world that moves too fast, they prefer to keep pedaling at their own pace.</p>\n<p><em>Learn more about Cima Coppi <a href=\"https://cimacoppi.cc/en/\">here.</a> </em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/cima-coppi-sustainable-cycling/\">Cima Coppi: Pedaling Towards Sustainable Cycling</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f61e7f0391b7ee8c313549809df90bcf073b1efa1d7427c4dd542b8d12842acd","category":"Cycling"}
