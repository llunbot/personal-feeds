We do see, though, that they look like toy iPhones that might come in a McDonald’s Happy Meal. Debuting at this fashion show gives me strong solid-gold Apple Watch Edition vibes from 2015 — except that Apple told us what Apple Watch actually did, and offered it in affordable aluminum models.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t get it.
