Apple approached Sony\nearlier this year, and the duo agreed to work together on\nlaunching support for the PlayStation VR2’s hand controllers on\nthe Vision Pro. Inside Sony, the work has been a monthslong\nundertaking, I’m told. And Apple has discussed the plan with\nthird-party developers, asking them if they’d integrate support\ninto their games. [...]</p>\n\n<p>One hiccup is that Sony doesn’t currently sell its VR hand\ncontrollers as a standalone accessory. The company would need to\ndecouple the equipment from its own headset and kick off\noperations to produce and ship the accessory on its own. As part\nof the arrangement, Sony would sell the controllers at Apple’s\nonline and retail stores, which already offer PS5 versions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/08/gurman-apple-sony-vr-controllers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"96a4957698eb12c354da58af34b833c07e899fc93b7a31b592dbaf3819c2061e","category":"Tech"}
