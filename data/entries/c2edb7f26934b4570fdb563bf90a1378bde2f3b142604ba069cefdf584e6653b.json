US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler quashed a subpoena issued by film studios in an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.408359/gov.uscourts.cand.408359.23.0.pdf\">order</a> that agrees with Reddit that the First Amendment protects the users' right to speak anonymously online.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment right to anonymous speech is not absolute, but the precedent followed by US district courts only forces disclosure of anonymous users' identities \"in the exceptional case where the compelling need for the discovery sought outweighs the First Amendment rights of the anonymous speaker,\" Beeler noted. After reviewing the facts and arguments, she found that the Reddit users' comments were irrelevant to the film studios' underlying case and that the studios could obtain relevant information from other sources.</p>\n<p>Reddit has no involvement in the underlying case, which is a copyright lawsuit in a different federal court against cable Internet service provider RCN. Bodyguard Productions, Millennium Media, and other film companies sued RCN in the US District Court in New Jersey over RCN customers' alleged downloads of <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.480117/gov.uscourts.njd.480117.1.2.pdf\">34 movies</a> such as <em>Hellboy</em>, <em>Rambo: Last Blood</em>, <em>Tesla</em>, and <em>The Hitman's Bodyguard</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935664#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935664&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2edb7f26934b4570fdb563bf90a1378bde2f3b142604ba069cefdf584e6653b","category":"Tech"}
