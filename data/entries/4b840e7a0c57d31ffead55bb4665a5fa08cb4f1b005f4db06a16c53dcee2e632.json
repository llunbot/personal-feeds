The organization behind Bluetooth promises that this technology will <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluetooth-sig-introduces-true-distance-awareness-new-secure-fine-ranging-feature-enhances-bluetooth-connected-devices-302235876.html\">achieve</a> \"centimeter-level accuracy over considerable distances,\" making it easier and quicker for users to locate lost items.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already offers a Precision Finding feature in the Find My app that leverages Ultra Wideband technology to help users pinpoint the specific location of select accessories. The feature is available on the iPhone 11 and newer, and currently it can be used to find an AirTag or a second-generation AirPods Pro charging case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could use both Bluetooth 6.0 and Ultra Wideband technologies in unison to improve Precision Finding. Bluetooth 6.0 also paves the way for Precision Finding-like location accuracy for devices that are not equipped with Ultra Wideband chips, such as the Apple TV's Siri Remote and devices released by other companies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear when the first devices with Bluetooth 6.0 will be released, but given that the specification is only just now available to hardware manufacturers and developers, the first Apple devices with support are likely at least a year away.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bluetooth/\">Bluetooth</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/bluetooth-6-0-now-available/\">Bluetooth 6 Launches, Could Enhance iPhone's Precision Finding Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluetooth-6-launches-could-enhance-iphones-precision-finding-feature.2435070/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4b840e7a0c57d31ffead55bb4665a5fa08cb4f1b005f4db06a16c53dcee2e632","category":"Apple"}
