The main processor is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>, which is responsible for processing content, running the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> operating system, executing computer vision algorithms, and providing graphical content.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe R1 chip meanwhile processes all of the information coming from the 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones in the headset, and streams images to the displays within 12 milliseconds – eight times faster than the blink of an eye – providing the wearer with a virtually lag-free view of the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo support the R1's high-speed requirements, the headset will reportedly use a 1-gigabit low latency DRAM chip supplied by SK hynix that features an increased number of input and output pins to minimize delays. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe DRAM chip is also said to utilize a unique packaging method called Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging, which enables it to be attached to the R1 chipset as a single integrated unit, allowing for a doubling in processing speed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's $3,500 headset is set to go on sale early next year. Chinese contract manufacturer Luxshare will initially assemble the device. However, according to one report, Apple may <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/\">limit production to fewer than 400,000 units in 2024</a>, due to issues related to the supply of the two micro-OLED displays for the wearer's eyes and the outward-facing curved lenticular lens. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/koreaherald-com/\">Korea Herald</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/11/apple-vision-pro-headset-integrated-dram/\">Apple Vision Pro to Feature Custom-Designed Low Latency DRAM Chip Supplied by SK Hynix</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-to-feature-custom-designed-low-latency-dram-chip-supplied-by-sk-hynix.2395583/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a569c5806bea9168aa82fbe85666f1473caf9ae28275dfb27f34d31220c1e5f5","category":"Apple"}
