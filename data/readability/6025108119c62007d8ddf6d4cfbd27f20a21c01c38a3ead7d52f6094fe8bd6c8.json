Children are then able to hold onto the handlebar, inside of your arms which help corral them and keep them in place.

The original Shotgun seat clamped down on the frame, which was fine for some bikes, but not so good for carbon frames or ebikes with large downtubes.</p><p>Now, the Shotgun Pro model mounts to the steerer tube and seat post, similar to other products out there like the Mac Ride. Kids Ride Shotgun states that their product stands out for the addition of tool free adjustments like leg length and saddle angle, in addition to fitting all mountain bikes with a 1 1/8″ upper steerer, including ebikes.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122326/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

More than one bike in the family? The Pro model includes two of these 10mm headset spacers so you can quickly swap from one ride to another. Adapters may be needed for certain bikes including those with the Trek Knock Block and Scott Syncros headsets, and it is not compatible with threaded headsets with quill stems. You’ll also need to make sure you have room under your stem, which could be an issue if you’re running a super short stem that is slammed.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1.jpg\" alt=\"Kids Ride Shotgun Pro Child Seat on specialized ebike\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11122305/Kids-Ride-Shotgun-Shotgun-Pro-Seat-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Compatible with all seat post sizes, including dropper posts, you’ll need at least 14mm of exposed seat post (not the upper dropper tube) in order for it to fit.</p><p><span><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/74QII2CVjH4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span></p><p>Designed for kids aged 2-5, and up to 60lbs, there’s no harness so the child should be able to support themselves.
