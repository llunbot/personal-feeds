It’s a strong sign in the ebike industry that big-name manufacturers can not simply lock out smaller competitors. And it likely will help spur development as more companies can vie for customers with their latest technical innovations…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Antitrust decision opens Bosch ebikes to 3rd-party ABS</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components.jpg\" alt=\"Blubrake ABS G2 bicycle anti-lock braking system, smaller lighter bike antilock brakes, system diagram\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components-297x111.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components-800x300.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components-768x288.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blubrake-ABS-G2-bicycle-anti-lock-braking-system_smaller-lighter-bike-antilock-brakes_components-1536x576.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image/Blubrake)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent ruling by the Italian Antitrust Authority basically requires the maker of ebike motor &amp; drive systems to create a more collaborative, more open environment for integrating 3rd-party anti-lock brake systems. It effectively necessitates a standardized connection and communication protocol so that 3rd-party ABS can connect their sensors and automated braking controls to the main ebike powertrain system and centralize control &amp; display units. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-lock brakes on bike and even ebikes are still in their infancy. But we’ve seen just Bosch ABS progress from a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-abs-prototype-the-future-of-integrated-braking-for-e-bikes-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\">concept-only</a> three years ago, to viable <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-abs-arrives-for-new-smart-system-on-emtbs-and-ecargo-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">eCargo &amp; eMTB</a> solutions a year later, to now even including cargo, touring, allroad &amp; trail specific ABS tuning today.  <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=blubrake\" target=\"_blank\">Blubrake</a> has seen just as much progress with ABS for cargo &amp; commuting, and even collaborative integration with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-abs-by-blubrake-anti-lock-disc-brakes/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano</a> braking and ebike systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blubrake-guy-on-cargo-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"868\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blubrake-guy-on-cargo-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Blubrake e-bike ABS system, rider on e-cargo bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blubrake-guy-on-cargo-bike.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blubrake-guy-on-cargo-bike-297x215.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blubrake-guy-on-cargo-bike-800x579.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blubrake-guy-on-cargo-bike-120x87.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blubrake-guy-on-cargo-bike-768x556.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Blubrake)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, this antitrust ruling sounds mostly like a big win for the relatively smaller Italian ABS maker Blubrake. Bosch agreed to provide a hardware wiring and software solution to allow OEMs to connect the latest Bosch eBike Smart System 3 (BES3) with Blubrake ABS.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s also a welcome sign prohibiting major technology players in cycling and ebikes from using their dominant positions in the market to block competition and continued innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>      <em>Full Blubrake Press Release below:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><blockquote><p><br /><br /><br /><strong>Milan, 2nd September 2024</strong> – Blubrake, a well-known designer and manufacturer of anti-lock braking systems for e-bikes, is pleased to announce a significant development that will increase market freedom and interoperability for e-bike manufacturers. Following a recent decision by the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM), Bosch will ensure the compatibility of its BES3 e-kits with Blubrake ABS.<br /><br /><strong>Background of the decision<br /></strong>The proceedings had been opened by the AGCM in September 2023 following a complaint lodged by Blubrake addressing compatibility issues between Bosch’s e-bike kits and third party ABS systems. Concerns were raised that Bosch could restrict competition in the e-bike ABS market by limiting the use of alternative technologies.<br />On 5th August 2024 the AGCM announced that it had accepted and made binding the commitments proposed by Bosch, under which Bosch will ensure that its e-kits are compatible with Blubrake’s ABS system, thereby promoting a more competitive and innovative market.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits for Bicycle Manufacturers<br /></strong>This decision is an important step towards a more open and competitive ABS market. Bicycle manufacturers now have the opportunity to integrate Blubrake ABS into their e-bikes, even when using Bosch e-kits. Fabio Todeschini, CEO of Blubrake, commented, “We strongly believe in the need for a modular market, where e-bike manufacturers have freedom of component choice, keeping quality and interoperability at the maximum possible level. The AGCM’s decision is in line with this vision by promoting compatibility between different systems. We strongly welcome Bosch’s decision to work with us towards this goal.”<br /><br /><strong>Timeline for Integration<br /></strong>It is already possible to test a fleet of e-bikes equipped with both Bosch kits and Blubrake ABS systems. From October 2024, manufacturers will have access to a Y-cable and beta software that will enable the ABS icon to appear on the display. By October 2025, both the Y-cable and the final version of the BES3 software will be available for full-scale production.<br /><br /><strong>Legal Team<br /></strong>Blubrake was advised and represented throughout the proceedings by Trevisan &amp; Cuonzo Avvocati, with partner Vittorio Cerulli Irelli, counsel Virginia Bellucci and of counsel Mario Libertini. A strong thank you to the team for the great execution.<br /><br /><strong>Blubrake and the Future of ABS on E-Bikes<br /></strong>Anti-lock braking system is a key safety feature in the e-bike market, and thanks to its benefits e-bike makers can use it to attract more people to ride e-bikes, as well as to extend the usage of e-bikes for existing customers.<br /><br />We believe therefore that in the next years ABS will become a standard in e-bike market and we are working to fulfil e-bike makers’ needs.<br /><br />We invite industry stakeholders to explore how adopting Blubrake ABS can help them to reach their objectives<br /><br /><em><a href=\"https://blubrake.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Blubrake.it</a></em></p></blockquote></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-ebike-abs-interoperability-opens-up-for-blubrake-more-with-eu-antitrust-ruling/\">Bosch ebike ABS Interoperability Opens Up For Blubrake &amp; More with EU Antitrust Ruling</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"663356107b00725c48d8d47a19ce8d56ba3477cb3e09a846c32f928893e3a95b","category":"Cycling"}
