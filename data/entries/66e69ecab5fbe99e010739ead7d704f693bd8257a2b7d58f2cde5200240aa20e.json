Apple silicon — including C1 — the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo other Apple devices contain the C1. All other ‌iPhone‌ models use modems from Qualcomm. Similar to how <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a> allowed Apple to move away from Intel processors, Apple's 5G modem allows the company to reduce its reliance on Qualcomm.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">Apple Unveils 'C1' as First Custom Cellular Modem</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-c1-as-first-custom-cellular-modem.2449706/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"66e69ecab5fbe99e010739ead7d704f693bd8257a2b7d58f2cde5200240aa20e","category":"Apple"}
