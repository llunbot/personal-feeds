Unlike last year's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/\">single-location event</a> featuring a keynote by CEO Sam Altman, DevDay 2024 is more than just one day, adopting a global approach with additional events planned for London on October 30 and Singapore on November 21.</p>\n\n<p>The San Francisco event, which was invitation-only and closed to press, featured <a href=\"https://x.com/swyx/status/1841173181002051911\">on-stage speakers</a> going through technical presentations. Perhaps the most notable new API feature is the Realtime API, now in public beta, which supports speech-to-speech conversations using six preset voices and enables developers to build features very similar to ChatGPT's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/when-counting-quickly-openais-new-voice-mode-stops-to-catch-its-breath/\">Advanced Voice Mode</a> (AVM) into their applications.</p>\n<p>OpenAI says that the Realtime API streamlines the process of creating voice assistants. Previously, developers had to use multiple models for speech recognition, text processing, and text-to-speech conversion. Now, they can handle the entire process with a single API call.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053625#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053625&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ee5d5a3bfbf042e3c1c3f1abdc0ab5b939bda45e1bfef7b60b7637d1f84cfbc","category":"Tech"}
