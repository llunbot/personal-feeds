But frankly, their spoke tension adjusting rim concept is bike-nerdy enough that it’s worth sharing anyway. We know <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=fairbicycle\" target=\"_blank\">FAIR</a> mostly for their unique seatpost &amp; dropper head toppers, bringing more seat angle adjustment and even lower stack height to the bike you already have. But obviously, their engineers can get pretty creative when they think outside the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FAIR IPA adjustable pressure rim concept is out there, right?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_rim-section.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_rim-section.webp\" alt=\"FAIR IPA Rim Concept Adjusts Your Ride with Internal Air Pressure, section\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_rim-section.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_rim-section-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_rim-section-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_rim-section-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_rim-section-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Images/FAIR)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, Fair says this was them thinking <em>inside</em> the box. That is, inside the box section of your mountain bike rim. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Is it really possible that we live in the 21st century, yet in mountain biking the top riders / mechanics still have to hand tune their spoke tension to get the desired ride feel out of their wheels?</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the underlying thought that led to this out-there concept. They derived the solution a bit from the problem <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-procore-dual-chamber-tubeless-system-now-shipping-works-w-most-mountain-bike-tire-rims/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe had with ProCore</a> a decade ago, when their high-pressure inner tire liner actually detensioned a wheel’s spokes when fully inflated to its max 90spi operating pressure. So, if that could happen by accident, why not do it on purpose to fine-tune a wheel’s stiffness?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enter IPA – Internal Pressure Adjust</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section.webp\" alt=\"FAIR IPA Rim Concept Adjusts Your Ride with Internal Air Pressure, cutaway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_cutaway-section-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fair wanted to create a solution to use pressure to quickly and easily wheel stiffness. They said riders had a difficult time sensing changes in wheel vertical compliance, but could easily differentiate a wheel with extra lateral deflection from lower spoke tension. So maybe fine-tuning that lateral stability through adjustable tension could be the path to finding a sweetspot in stiffness, grip, and control. And maybe add the possibility to tune for different tracks – say buff flow trail berms vs. DH track ruts?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail.webp\" alt=\"FAIR IPA Rim Concept Adjusts Your Ride with Internal Air Pressure, valve\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_valve-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So they developed an inflatable air chamber inside a concave rim section. Increasing pressure inside the rim would expand the rim, decreasing its ERD – the effective rim diameter from the spoke bed – thus decreasing tension in the spokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s rather simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add more air, ERD and stiffness decrease. Remove air pressure, ERD and stiffness increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It’s just a concept, though</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail.webp\" alt=\"FAIR IPA Rim Concept Adjusts Your Ride with Internal Air Pressure, spokes &amp; nipples\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FAIR-IPA-Rim-Concept-Adjusts-Your-Ride-with-Internal-Air-Pressure_spoke-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>First of all, IPA TECH is not a commercial product yet.
