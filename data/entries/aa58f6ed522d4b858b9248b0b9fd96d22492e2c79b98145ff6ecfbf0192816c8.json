If this rumor is accurate, the iPhone SE would finally gain Face ID and a notch instead of Touch ID and a Home button, along with a larger 6.1-inch display. Other rumored features for the next iPhone SE <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/\">include a USB-C port and an Action button</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report said the new iPhone SE will remain a \"cheaper\" option in the iPhone lineup, as expected. The current iPhone SE starts at $429 in the U.S. with 64GB of storage, with other key features including a 4.7-inch display, A15 Bionic chip, 5G support, a single 12-megapixel rear camera, and a Lightning port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKeep track of our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE roundup</a> for the latest rumors.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/when-to-expect-the-next-iphone-se/\">When to Expect the Next iPhone SE to Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-the-next-iphone-se-to-launch.2426709/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa58f6ed522d4b858b9248b0b9fd96d22492e2c79b98145ff6ecfbf0192816c8","category":"Apple"}
