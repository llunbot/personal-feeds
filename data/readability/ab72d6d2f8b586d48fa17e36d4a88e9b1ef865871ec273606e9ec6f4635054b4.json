Had he been running one of these micro-hand protectors when riding that day, he may have come away from the altercation with a tree with his fifth digit still intact. For those of you wondering whether the Counterpunch slides against tree bark or actually hooks onto it, Loam Labs created this video to demonstrate…</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3mAFCntzvU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Loam Lab Counterpunch</h2><p>Mark created the Counterpunch to decrease the likelihood of breaking your pinkie when you take a hit off a tree. The component essentially replaces your standard bar-end plug, secured via a simple expansion collar. A metal protrusion extends forwards, hugging the outer edge of your pinkie. It isn’t a full-on hook. The subtle curve is designed to help the bar slide against the tree bark, allowing you to glance off it.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips.jpg\" alt=\"loam lab counterpunch\" width=\"1600\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips-297x102.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips-800x274.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips-120x41.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips-768x263.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104000/loam-lab-counterpunch-pinkie-protection-mtb-trail-grips-1536x526.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Of course, some riders like to hang the outboard edge of their palm off the edge of the grip; Loam Lab says the Counterpunch still allows you to do that to a certain degree.

This is a thin (29mm) lock-on grip, with select portions of the inner plastic sleeve cut away in an effort to improve comfort in strategic areas. Loam Lab says the cutaway core at the thumb region creates a thicker flexible pad that absorbs vibration for better traction with less gripping force required.</p><div id=\"attachment_278639\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-278639\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile.jpg\" alt=\"loam lab grip single clamp lock on grip\" width=\"1600\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile-297x110.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile-800x296.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile-120x44.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile-768x284.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17104539/loam-lab-grip-single-clamp-cutaway-profile-1536x568.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-278639\">Loam Lab grips are a little shorter than most at 115mm, designed to better suit a hand position where the palm hangs outboard slightly; that leaves more room at the inboard end of the bar for brake lever and dropper post remote placement.</p></div><p>This dual-clamp grip is designed to work seamlessly with the Counterpunch, but Loam Lab does offer a single-clamp version for those who don’t want to run the pinkie protection.</p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>The Loam Lab Counterpunch retails at $39 CAD.
