Training (creating) a new AI model usually requires a large amount of computing power, including many GPUs, which means that Musk's acquisition could represent a significant commitment toward developing a deep-learning AI model within Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>In late February, The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/fighting-woke-ai-musk-recruits-team-to-develop-openai-rival\">broke news</a> that Musk had approached AI researchers to form a new AI lab to compete with OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/\">ChatGPT</a>, including former DeepMind researchers <span>Igor Babuschkin and Manuel Kroiss</span>.
