It's the Chevrolet Bolt, which we first <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/01/chevrolets-bolt-is-an-electric-vehicle-for-the-masses-and-weve-driven-it/\">sampled at CES in 2016</a>, then drove for real when it went on sale <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/02/its-a-really-good-car-our-first-100-miles-in-a-2017-chevrolet-bolt/\">the following year</a>. A <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/turns-out-the-chevy-bolt-is-a-lot-of-fun-to-autocross/\">fun-to-drive</a> hatchback that could feel a little spartan—some people hate the seats in early models—it was also quite affordable, with prices dropping well below $30,000 for a car with a range of 259 miles (417 km).</p>\n<p>Understandably we were pretty upset to learn that General Motors was calling time on this solid little EV; <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/gm-confirms-chevy-bolt-will-die-this-year-making-way-for-electric-pickups/\">in April this year</a> it announced it was ending the product line. But today, during GM's Q2 results call, CEO Mary Barra revealed the Bolt will be back.</p>\n<p>\"Our customers love today's Bolt. It has been delivering record sales and some of the highest customer satisfaction and loyalty scores in the industry,\" said Barra. \"It's also an important source of conquest sales for the company and for Chevrolet. We will keep the momentum going by delivering a new Bolt… and we will execute it more quickly compared to an all-new program with significantly lower engineering expense and capital investment by updating the vehicle with Ultium and Ultifi technologies and by applying our 'winning with simplicity' discipline,\" Barra said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956353#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956353&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
