That in itself is not unusual. Race Face and E13 offer crank arms under this weight. However, this is still impressive given that Garbaruk’s cranks use aluminium.</p>\n<p>Garbaruk uses a two-piece hollow body design for the crank arms. The two sides of each crank arm are machined from aluminium and are then bonded together.</p>\n<p>The crank arms are broad, which should keep stiffness high. Perhaps as a consequence of this, though, the Q-factor is 170mm. This is wider than the 162mm of Shimano’s XTR M9100, but in between the 168mm or 174mm of SRAM’s XX SL cranks.</p>\n<p>Using aluminium means Garbaruk can anodise the XC Crankset and offer it in several colours, much like its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassettes</a>. Riders can choose from one of eight colours for the crank arms and lockrings.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Garbaruk XC crankset showing grooves on crank arm.\" title=\"Garbaruk-XC-crankset20230904_stan-portus26\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tom has kept it subtle with silver crank arms.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>My test set features silver arms and black lockrings. Silver may be plain, but it should withstand heel rub better than the other colours.</p>\n<p>The construction of the arms is unusual, but the rest of the crankset is fairly standard.</p>\n<p>The aluminium spindle is 30mm in diameter and 136mm long for a 52mm chainline. This means it’s not fully compatible with SRAM’s new T-Type Transmissions. Garbaruk claims its chainrings are compatible with T-Type chains, so I will try and see how this setup works.</p>\n<h2>Garbaruk DM MTB Chainring</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Garbaruk XC chaining.\" title=\"Garbaruk-XC-crankset20230904_stan-portus13\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The oval DM MTB chainring uses Cannondale’s fitment system.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Garbaruk’s DM MTB Chainring pairs with the crank arms. The chainring is offered in a range of sizes from 26-36T. Like the crank arms, you can choose from eight colours.</p>\n<p>Unusually, Garbaruk uses Cannondale’s Hollowgram fitment for its chainring. While many brands use SRAM’s 3-bolt standard, Garbaruk’s use of Cannondale’s fitment means your chainring options will be more limited. Even so, the direct mount design means changes should be easy.</p>\n<p>The lockring is a finely machined piece that looks to keep the weight down.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Garbaruk XC crankset showing embossed details on inside of chainring.\" title=\"Garbaruk-XC-crankset20230904_stan-portus36\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tooth count is debossed on the inside edge of the chainring.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Garbaruk offers 3mm (boost) or 6mm (standard) offsets and round or oval profiles. I have the 34T oval 3mm offset chainring.</p>\n<p>Garbaruk uses a 108-degree clocking on the oval chainring. Garbaruk claims this provides even pedalling torque at the wheel.</p>\n<p>This should minimise dead spots in your pedal stroke and make riding uphill easier, particularly on soft or slippery terrain.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Garbaruk name printed on chainring.\" title=\"Garbaruk-XC-crankset20230904_stan-portus11\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Garbaruk’s name is printed on the chainring.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As with most single chainrings used in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a>, Garbaruk uses an alternating narrow-wide tooth profile.
