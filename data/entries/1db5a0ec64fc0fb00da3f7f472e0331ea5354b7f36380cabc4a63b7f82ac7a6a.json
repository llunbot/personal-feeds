This caused the vehicle to tumble, snapping off all four of the helicopter's blades.</p>\n<h2>Delving into the root cause</h2>\n<p>It is not easy to conduct a forensic analysis like this on Mars, which is typically about 100 million miles from Earth. <em>Ingenuity</em> carried no black box on board, so investigators have had to piece together their findings from limited data and imagery.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/nasa-believes-it-understands-why-ingenuity-crashed-on-mars/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/nasa-believes-it-understands-why-ingenuity-crashed-on-mars/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1db5a0ec64fc0fb00da3f7f472e0331ea5354b7f36380cabc4a63b7f82ac7a6a","category":"Tech"}
