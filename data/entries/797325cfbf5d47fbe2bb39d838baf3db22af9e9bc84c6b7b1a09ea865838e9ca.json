But what it lacks in the bling department it makes up for in the versatile market. Is the ride warming up? Strap your jacket to the frame. Don’t need your gloves anymore? Strap them to your bike. Carry an extra tube, your snacks, a banana, you name it, this strap will come in handy, Ornot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every cyclist needs a multi-tool along for the ride, and the <strong>Park Tool IB-2</strong> ($19, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F713812%2Fpark-tool-i-beam-mini-tool%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">REI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpark-tool-i-beam-mini-hex-screwdriver-star-set-ib-2\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) has <em>most</em> of what you’ll need in a tiny, lightweight package that fits in a saddlebag, jersey pocket, or even the tiny side pockets on some hydration pack waistbands. It’s a great starter tool or a perfect replacement for the weight weenie. (<em>Check out all <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/06/25/best-bike-multitools-minitools/\" target=\"_blank\">our favorite mini-tools here</a></em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chamois Butt’r may be the original anti-chafe cream (or at least the best known), but it wasn’t until they introduced their <strong>Coconut Oil &amp; Shea Butter formula</strong> ($20, available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M59S1WZ/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpaceline-products-chamois-buttr-cocunut-creme\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) that it became one of our favorites. Along with a good pair of padded shorts, a good chamois cream will improve rider comfort, especially if you’re not used to spending much time on a saddle.

It works with both Presta and Schrader valves, rotates to keep the screen in view, and has a pressure release valve to help you dial in your setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep the cyclist in your life as safe as possible with a <strong>Reflective Roadrunner Short Sleeve T-Shirt</strong> ($29.25 available at <a href=\"https://roadrunnerbags.us/collections/lifestyle-bags/products/reflective-t-shirt\">Road Runner Bags</a>) from Los Angeles, California’s own Road Runner Bags. Maybe the rider in your life doesn’t care for wearing lycra when riding. maybe they commute during heavy traffic and need a little boost of reflective highlights to help keep them safe. These are made in the USA and come in sizes S, M, L, XL, and XXL. “Stay seen, stay safe”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Adventure Medical Kits Ultralight/Watertight .7</strong> ($33 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F695383%2Fadventure-medical-kits-ultralightwatertight-7-medical-kit%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">REI</a>) is a compact first aid kit in a waterproof pouch that fits in a jersey pocket. This means it’ll fit in a hip pack, hydration pack, or glove box just fine, too. We take one with us on almost every ride, and there’s a bit extra room to customize it with whatever meds or little additions you want to add.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bicycle Gifts under $100</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1539\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HGG-general-100-copy-1.jpg\" alt=\"Best gifts under $100\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HGG-general-100-copy-1.jpg 1539w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HGG-general-100-copy-1-297x191.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HGG-general-100-copy-1-800x514.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HGG-general-100-copy-1-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HGG-general-100-copy-1-768x494.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HGG-general-100-copy-1-1536x987.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Muc-Off 8-in-1 Bicycle Cleaning Kit</strong> ($80, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F131914%2Fmuc-off-8-in-1-bicycle-cleaning-kit%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">REI</a>) gets you all of the essential brushes to clean every part of your bike, plus a spray-on cleaner that gently releases grime from your chain or road spray. We like this because it lets us add whatever degreaser and chain lube we like, and it’s half the price of their bigger kit while still giving you all the right brushes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are firm believers that every bike should be equipped with a bell to help stay safe by being heard. The <strong>Spurcycle Original Bell</strong> ($59 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F153845%2Fspurcycle-original-bike-bell-raw%3Fcolor%3DRAW\">REI</a>) is not only our favorite, but it is a real thing of beauty. It can be heard pretty far away with its distinctive “ring”. It’s a sharp but pleasant ring that we’ve witnessed penetrate trail users’ headphones. These are precision-built in the USA for a lifetime of bell ringing. Comes with the ability to swap from a handlebar with a 2.22 diameter, to a bar with a 31.8 diameter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your favorite cyclist has been dropping hint that they need more hydration, the <strong>Camelbak Hydrobak Light 50oz</strong> ($65, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=/BxsnbLejGQ&amp;mid=46553&amp;u1=brspbrspcamelbakq423&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.camelbak.com%2Fshop%2Fpacks%2Fbike%2Fhydrobak-light-50oz%2FCB-2405.html%3Fdwvar_CB-2405_color%3DGibraltar%2520Navy%252FBlack\">Camelbak</a>*) could be a good place to start. The minimalist hydration pack includes a 1.5L (50oz) Crux reservoir with a Quicklink disconnect hose and an Air Support Light back panel with ventilated harness straps. There’s also a secure zippered pocket for essentials and the ability to carry a helmet, spare tube, and a light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what type of cyclist you’re buying for, there are times when we’ll skip the full Spandex kit but we still want <em>some</em> padding. Whether it’s for a long spin around town or a casual ride with friends. The <strong>Club Ride Woodchuck</strong> (Men’s, $60 available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17973&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clubrideapparel.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-bike-chamois-shorts%2Fproducts%2Fwoodchuck-mens-bike-short%3Fvariant%3D15960519999559\">Club Ride Apparel</a>) and <strong>Montcham</strong> (Women’s, $60 available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17973&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clubrideapparel.com%2Fproducts%2Fmontcham-womens-bike-short%3Favad%3D293233_e349f9ff1\">Club Ride Apparel</a>) are super comfortable under regular shorts (or even jeans), with just enough compression to support muscles on longer, harder rides, too. They’re great under MTB baggies, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t forget your <strong>Local Bike Shop!</strong> In fact, any of this stuff you can find locally should be bought locally. And let’s face it, there’s always going to be some repair we don’t wanna do ourselves or some part we need in a pinch. Buying local and supporting your favorite bike shop means they’ll be around when you need them! <strong>Grab a Gift Certificate</strong> to your cyclist’s favorite shop so they can get exactly what they need when they need it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Cycling Gifts under $250</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist-2.jpg\" alt=\"Best Gifts for cyclists\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you could get them good bike lights for far less money. But these <strong>Bontrager Ion 200 RT/Flare RT lights </strong>($110, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F152981%2Fbontrager-ion-200-rtflare-rt-light-set%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">REI</a>) are some of the best we’ve tried. They’re tiny, and ultra-lightweight, but are extremely bright and long-lasting. Their blink patterns can be seen from up to 2km away in full daylight, and they’re even bright enough to navigate dark backroads in a pinch, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, you can get cheaper floor pumps, but few if any will outlast a Silca. In fact, chances are this will get passed down to the next generation of cyclists from its original owner.  The <strong>Silca Pista Plus Floor Pump </strong>($200, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F167782%2Fsilca-pista-plus-floor-pump%3Fcolor%3DGRAY\">REI</a>) is a do-it-all pump with its special Presta valve chuck that makes it quick and easy to inflate any bike you’ve got. And it’s fully rebuildable, so it won’t end up in the landfill if something does break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Chrome Volcan 26L Backpack </strong>($111.93, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F144645%2Fchrome-volcan-pack&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a>) may not look like much or have any bells and whistles, but that’s exactly what makes it so useful. Headed to the grocery store? You can shove a ton of food in this. Or a case of beer with ice (it’s 100% waterproof). Or a bunch of clothes for changing at work <em>and</em> the gym. It’s a giant, gaping black hole of a bag that works for anything without tiny pockets and organizers dictating how you use it (though it does have a padded laptop sleeve). If you don’t have a cargo bike, you need a bag like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Cycling Gifts over $250</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1624\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Best gifts for cyclists over $250\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-297x188.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-800x508.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-768x487.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-1536x975.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-copy-2048x1300.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every cyclist should have a good work stand, and if you’re working on heavy e-bikes (see below), you’ll need a heavy-duty work stand ($495 ). The new<strong> Feedback Sports Pro Mechanic HD Bike Repair Stand</strong> ($495 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219246%2Ffeedback-sports-pro-mechanic-hd-repair-stand%3Fcolor%3DRED\">REI</a>) is a burlier version of their impressive work stands that’s meant to handle ebike heft. Even if you’re not working on ebikes, heavier bikes like long travel mountain bikes, commuter bikes, and anything else that isn’t light weight will benefit from the bigger tubes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether your favorite cyclist gets lost on purpose or by accident, make sure they can always make their way back with the <strong>wahoo ELEMNT ROAM V2 GPS bike computer</strong> ($400 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F195825%2Fwahoo-fitness-elemnt-roam-gps-cycling-computer%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">REI</a>). The smart navigation features are easy to use, which is wahoo’s calling card – no need to spend hours learning how to use your GPS, just get on and go. The color screen has just enough color to call out important information, but it’s still easy to see in bright sunlight and the battery lasts long enough for all but the longest adventures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we’re dreaming big, then we think everyone should have an e-Cargo Bike. But not all riders have the room to store an e-Cargo bike, so bikes like the <strong>Co-Op Cycles Generation e1.1 </strong>($1,499 [on sale for $899.39] at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F189967%2Fco-op-cycles-generation-e11-electric-bike%3Fcolor%3DCRATER%2520LAKE\">REI</a>*) pack cargo abilities into a pint-sized package. You still get a built-in rear rack (the e1.2 adds a front rack as well), but the 20″ wheels provide a lower standover and shorter wheelbase making it easier to store. The e1.1 runs a smaller 417Wh battery and a suspension fork, while the<strong> e1.2</strong> ($1,899 [on sale for $1,139.39] at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F190640%2Fco-op-cycles-generation-e12-electric-bike%3Fcolor%3DDESERT%2520SUNSET\">REI</a>*) is fully rigid with front and rear racks, but adds a larger 672Wh battery for longer range. REI is also running a massive 40% off sale on these until 11/20, making them even more enticing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>*<em>Denotes sponsored placement</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cycling-holiday-gift-guide/\">Best Gifts For Cyclists: What to Get Your Favorite Bike Rider</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"797325cfbf5d47fbe2bb39d838baf3db22af9e9bc84c6b7b1a09ea865838e9ca","category":"Cycling"}
