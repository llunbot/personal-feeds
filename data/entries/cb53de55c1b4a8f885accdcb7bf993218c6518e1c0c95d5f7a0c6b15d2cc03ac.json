{"title":"Meta Fired ‘Roughly 20’ Employees for Leaking","link":"https://www.theverge.com/labor/621059/meta-fires-20-employee-leakers","date":1740784103000,"content":"\n<p>Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meta has fired “roughly 20” employees who leaked “confidential\ninformation outside the company,” according to a spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p>“We tell employees when they join the company, and we offer\nperiodic reminders, that it is against our policies to leak\ninternal information, no matter the intent,” Meta spokesperson\nDave Arnold tells The Verge exclusively. “We recently conducted an\ninvestigation that resulted in roughly 20 employees being\nterminated for sharing confidential information outside the\ncompany, and we expect there will be more. We take this seriously,\nand will continue to take action when we identify leaks.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These firings, of course, are the follow-up to one of my favorite headlines so far this year: “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/meta-warns-leakers-in-leaked-memo\">Meta Warns That It Will Fire Leakers in Leaked Memo</a>”. As I wrote in that post a month ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s not fear of getting fired that keeps employees at most\ncompanies from leaking. It’s that they find themselves aligned\nwith the company’s mission. They feel like part of a team that\nthey want to see succeed, and they naturally adopt an attitude of\nbeing a team player. Team players don’t leak the playbook because\nthey don’t like the coach’s play-calling or how much playing time\nthey’re getting. I’ve never gotten the sense that that sort of\nattitude exists at Meta.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m not sure this public crackdown will help. Meta seems to be leaning into fear to keep employees in line, rather than team spirit. Their war on leakers might prove about as effective as <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/four-decades-counting-continued-failure-war-drugs\">America’s decades-long “war on drugs”</a>, that saw illegal drug use  <em>rise</em>, not fall, even while our prisons filled up with non-violent drug-law offenders. What’s the Princess Leia line? “The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.” One longtime reader, who works at Netflix, contacted me after my month ago post and observed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That is such a great take on Meta’s leaks. Netflix stuff almost\nnever leaks, because Netflix is a place full of people who don’t\nwant to leak things. There are virtually no barriers, just a\nculture and collection of people who don’t do that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Penalties are a deterrence. But the reason most people don’t commit crimes — whether it be shoplifting or murder — isn’t fear of the potential penalties. It’s that they’re good honest people who don’t want to steal (and definitely don’t want to kill anyone).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/meta-fires-leakers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cb53de55c1b4a8f885accdcb7bf993218c6518e1c0c95d5f7a0c6b15d2cc03ac","category":"Tech"}
