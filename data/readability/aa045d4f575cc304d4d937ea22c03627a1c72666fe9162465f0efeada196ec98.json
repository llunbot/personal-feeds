Jackson was part of a three-rider breakaway alongside Maëlle Grossetête (FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope) who finished second on the day.</p><p>Lorena Wiebes (Team DSM) was the first finisher from the bunch, finishing third, four seconds behind Jackson. Race leader Marianne Vos (Jumbo-Visma) finished fourth and kept her general classification lead ahead of the stage 2 time trial.</p><p>Jackson was the first to attack early in the stage. She rode the first 25 km solo until Grossetête and Nina Buysman (Parkhotel Valkenburg) joined the breakaway 35 km into the stage. Jackson and Grossetête lost Buysman with a few kilometres remaining, when it looked like the peloton was closing in.</p><p>The chase from the peloton was on and off, with Team DSM and Canyon-SRAM taking turns at the front. Jumbo-Visma, the team of the race leader, wasn’t seen until the final kilometers. By then it was too late to bring the two out front back in time for a sprint finish.</p><p>In the end the peloton finished four seconds behind the escapees. It was another case of breakaway success, something that has been happening often in the women’s races. The first two stages of the Ladies Tour of Norway recenlty were won by a solo breakaway rider. Jackson won the points jersey in the Ladies Tour of Norway this year as well.</p><hr><div><div><p>Simac Ladies Tour (2.WWT) <span>Zwolle → Hardenberg</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/bc/alison-jackson-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"aa045d4f575cc304d4d937ea22c03627a1c72666fe9162465f0efeada196ec98","category":"Cycling"}
