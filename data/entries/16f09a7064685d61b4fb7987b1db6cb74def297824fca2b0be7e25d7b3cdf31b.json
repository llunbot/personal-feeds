Propped up on the back table in their booth, a much larger inverted suspension fork was sitting next to its smaller gravel cousins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like the Fox RAD fork situation, Cane Creek isnâ€™t divulging <em>any</em> information on the prototype other than confirming that it exists. All they would say is that Cane Creek is very proud of the fact that all of their development is done in-house, and this is a good example of how they engineer and build the products that they actually want to ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Cane-creek-Inverted-suspension-fork-prototype-sea-otter-09.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

recently installed a giant new CNC machine, and their machinist has been loving the opportunity to mill the fork crown out of a solid block of aluminum.

on the fork is the e-bike ready symbol on the steerer tube. It makes sense that any brand working on a long-travel mountain bike fork would want it to be e-bike compatible at this point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the fact that Cane Creek already offers an inverted fork for gravel, it seems likely that we may see a production inverted MTB fork in the near future. The question is when weâ€™ll see it and how it may compare to the Fox and any of the existing inverted forks out there from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/push-industries-nine-one-inverted-suspension-fork/\">PUSH</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/intend-samurai-cc-xc-tr-gr-upside-down-forks/\" target=\"_blank\">Intend</a>, etc. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prototype-cane-creek-mtb-inverted-suspension-fork-sea-otter/\">Prototype Cane Creek MTB Inverted Suspension Fork Joins the Party at Sea Otter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"16f09a7064685d61b4fb7987b1db6cb74def297824fca2b0be7e25d7b3cdf31b","category":"Cycling"}
