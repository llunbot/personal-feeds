This custom creation will then appear on other people's iPhones when you call them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also a new Live Voicemail feature that provides live voice transcription in real time on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> Lock Screen. Apple said that with this, you'll be able to make a more educated decision as to whether you want to talk to someone or not.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/f-a084e655a0cbfe0a5350a7865e16ede8608d98e9.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nIn ‌FaceTime‌, you can now leave video messages if someone doesn't pick up your video call. They'll get a notification about the message and can watch it whenever they have time, like a voicemail.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, Messages has a ton of updates. There are new search filters, a new \"catch up arrow\" that quickly jumps you to the first unread message in a long conversation, and easier inline replying with swipe to reply.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAudio messages are also now transcribed right within the messages thread, and there's inline location sharing. Check In provides a way to give updates on your location within a messages thread, and if you're ever delayed it'll send an alert to friends.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/f-58ec31256612fac428b02d4cab68d3f624667af9.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nApps within Messages have been moved to a new \"plus\" button at the bottom left of the app. Stickers have been revamped and you can even create your own stickers and motion stickers from  your own live photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese updates are a small portion of updates coming to ‌iOS 17‌, so be sure to read more about the new ‌iPhone‌ software <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-announces-ios-17-with-new-communication-and-sharing-features/\">in our main post</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/ios-17-phone-facetime-messages/\">iOS 17 Includes Updated Phone, FaceTime, and Messages Apps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-includes-updated-phone-facetime-and-messages-apps.2391625/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c8f8a54b5979ea61231a27deb78453a550ca4e261a045e2e44e390830215344","category":"Apple"}
