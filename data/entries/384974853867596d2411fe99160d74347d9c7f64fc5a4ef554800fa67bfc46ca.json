However, it slots into the range between the XC and Pro versions, at a claimed weight of 212g in 29″. The extra channels cut into the sides of this closed-cell foam insert reduce its weight and improve sealant flow around the tire, improving its appeal to the more weight-conscious trail rider who wants the improved cornering support and superior comfort conferred by an insert.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"cushcore trail mtb tire insert rim protection improved comfort\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CushCore-trail-tire-insert-rim-protection-vibration-damping.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>CushCore Trail Tire Inserts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to reduce vibration-induced fatigue, add impact protection to your precious rims, increase sidewall support for cornering, or indeed all of the above, then you should probably consider adding a set of tire inserts to your tubeless setup. My experience of the CushCore Pro tire inserts was largely very positive. I was particularly impressed with the enhanced grip, and reduction in fatigue felt on long, rough descents, and back when I was a lot fitter than I am now, I was more than happy to pedal the extra 514g up hill on my 27.5″ Enduro Bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, CushCore is reducing that weight penalty by a not insignificant 96 grams on a complete 29″ configuration with the addition of the CushCore Trail Tire Inserts. They are composed of the same closed-cell foam as all of the other inserts in the range, and thus do not absorb sealant, but they feature more channels around their circumference to encourage sealant flow. More channels means less material, thus reduced weight. They also have numerous “fluted” channels said to add a more progressive feel to the sidewall support felt when cornering hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"cushcore trail tire insert testing rock slabs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-trail-version-testing-utah.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Not a bad spot for tire insert testing</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>CushCore Tire Insert</td><td>27.5″</td><td>29″</td></tr><tr><td>Plus</td><td>290g</td><td>330g</td></tr><tr><td>Pro</td><td>257g (actual)</td><td>260g</td></tr><tr><td>Trail</td><td>199g</td><td>212g</td></tr><tr><td>XC</td><td>140g</td><td>150g</td></tr><tr><td>Gravel</td><td>–</td><td>120g</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>CushCore Tire Insert claimed weights (unless otherwise noted)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new CushCore Trail tire inserts retail at $150 USD per pair, or $78 USD for a single.

These were previously only available in green, but 9 more color options have now been added. The oil slick option is pricier at $30 USD per pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors-800x675.jpg\" alt=\"cushcore tire insert tubeless valves all colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors-800x675.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors-297x251.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors-120x101.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors-768x648.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors-1536x1296.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cushcore-tire-insert-specific-tubeless-44mm-Valves-10-Colors.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://cushcore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cushcore.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cushcore-trail-tire-inserts/\">CushCore Trail Tire Inserts Reduce Weight of Rim Protection &amp; Ride Comfort</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"384974853867596d2411fe99160d74347d9c7f64fc5a4ef554800fa67bfc46ca","category":"Cycling"}
