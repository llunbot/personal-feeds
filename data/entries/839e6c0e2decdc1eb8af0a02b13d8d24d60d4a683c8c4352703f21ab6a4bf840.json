If you want a disc brake hybrid bike, you may need to think about pushing your budget a little higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a hybrid bike for £500 or less should still provide reliable transport and even a sporty ride feel and should be durable if kept well maintained. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are our picks of hybrid bikes priced at around £500 that we think should be on your shortlist.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best hybrid bikes at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Raleigh Strada: RRP £449 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Fraleigh-strada-mens-hybrid-bike---16in-18in-20in-22in-frames-754254.html%3FstockInventory%3Dundefined\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords (£399)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Vitus Mach 1 Seven: RRP £450 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/p/vitus-mach-1-seven-tourney\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles (£450)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giant Escape 3: RRP £499 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Giant-Escape-3-2023-Hybrid-Sports-Bike_249251.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (£459)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Liv Alight 3: RRP £499 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.liv-cycling.com/gb/alight-3\" target=\"_blank\">Liv (£499)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Riverside 700: RRP £499.99 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fhybrid-bike-riverside-700-grey-sea%2F_%2FR-p-341646\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon (£449.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elops 500 City Bike: RRP £500 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fcity-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey%2F_%2FR-p-305016%3Fmc%3D8526940%26c%3Dgrey_blue\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon (£500)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Merida Crossway 10-V: RRP: £500 – buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Merida-Crossway-10-V-2023-Hybrid-Sports-Bike_244376.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (£450)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ridgeback Comet: RRP £500 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.awcycles.co.uk%2Fcategories%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Fproduct%2Fridgeback-comet-hybrid-bike-1\" target=\"_blank\">AW Cycles (£439.99)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Voodoo Marasa: RRP £500 – Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Fvoodoo-marasa-mens-hybrid-bike---m-l-frames-452894.html\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords (£500 – Men’s) / </a></strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Fvoodoo-marasa-womens-hybrid-bike---m-l-frames-452918.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>(£500 – Women’s)</strong></a></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why you can trust <em>Cyclist’s </em>advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist wearing hi vis vest\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/emma-ITD-sept2023-10.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Emma Cole / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at <em>Cyclist</em>, we’re riders just like you.

The alloy frame is paired with a steel fork and 650b wheels with wide 47mm tyres, which should provide ample comfort and grip. There’s a 3×7 speed Shimano groupset and the bike is equipped with alloy V-brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s nice to get mudguards ready-fitted to a hybrid bike at this price, making the Strada a good choice for all-weather riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £449</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Fraleigh-strada-mens-hybrid-bike---16in-18in-20in-22in-frames-754254.html%3FstockInventory%3Dundefined\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords (£399)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vitus Mach 1 Seven</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"582\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vitus-Mach-1-Seven-970x582.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vitus-Mach-1-Seven-970x582.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vitus-Mach-1-Seven-300x180.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vitus-Mach-1-Seven-768x461.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vitus-Mach-1-Seven-750x450.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vitus-Mach-1-Seven.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption>Vitus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vitus Mach 1 has an alloy frame and steel fork, complete with mudguard mounts and mechanical disc brakes. The single chainring keeps shifting simple and is paired with a seven speed Shimano Tourney rear derailleur and 12-28 tooth cassette. That’s perhaps not the best setup for hillier cities, but if you live somewhere flat the Mach 1 will get you about in comfort on its 650b wheels and Vee Tire Co Speedster 1.95in tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend a little more and you can upgrade to the VRX spec, which has a Shimano Nexus 3-speed internal hub gear, potentially cutting down on maintenance. Alternatively there’s the VR, which drops down to a single speed drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £450</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Giant Escape 3</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000-970x537.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000-970x537.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000-300x166.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000-768x425.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000-1536x850.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000-750x415.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000-1140x631.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/resizewidth_2000.jpg 1900w\" /><figcaption>Giant</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world’s largest bicycle maker it’s unsurprising Giant bikes are exceptional value. Based around a lightweight hydroformed aluminium frame, the Giant Escape 3’s relatively upright ride position combines comfort and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great looking bike, its finishing kit is made up of well-balanced, workmanlike components. Its Shimano Tourney gears rely on a more basic screw-on freehub system, but this is likely to go unnoticed by most riders, who will instead probably only appreciate the wide range of ratios they provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giant’s own-brand rims are better than those found on most similarly priced bikes. It’s a trait that combines with the largely slick 38mm tyres to render the Escape 3 a little lighter and more lively than you’d perhaps expect. Pay a little more and you can get the Escape 3 with disc brakes and even with mudguards and a rack for better all-weather capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £499</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Liv Alight 3</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-970x644.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-970x644.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/MY22Alight3_ColorAMilkyWay.jpg 1133w\" /><figcaption>Liv Cycling</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alight 3 is the women’s bike equivalent of the Giant Escape 3 above. Changes from the Giant include a step-through frame, although the geometry remains upright and comfortable. There’s a similar Aluxx frame to the Giant and a full array of mounts for mudguards and a rack to increase the Alight’s usefulness for commuting or load-lugging whatever the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv builds its bikes for a different size range to Giant, so the Align is designed for women riders from 148cm to 183cm in height.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the Giant, there’s a 3×7-speed Shimano Tourney groupset with a very wide gear range and Tektro linear pull brakes. The bike rolls on Giant S-X3 puncture protected 38mm tyres. There are also upgraded options with disc brakes and with full mudguards and a rack available. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price £499</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riverside 700</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-970x644.jpg\" alt width=\"855\" height=\"567\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-970x644.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-1140x757.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/hybrid-bike-riverside-700-greysea-green-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Decathlon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Decathlon keeps things simple with the Riverside 700, which pairs a single chainring with a 10-speed 11-40 tooth cassette for plenty of gear range without a front derailleur. It comes equipped with a 36-tooth chainring, but you can swap for a 34-tooth or a 38-tooth if you want to tweak the gear range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike has a 63mm travel adjustable suspension fork to help smooth things out, while mechanical disc brakes provide all-weather stopping power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Riverside 700 spec also include 3mm deep puncture protection in its 38mm tyres. There’s a good rider height range catered for by the four sizes, with Decathlon saying that the Riverside 700 would suit riders from 1.5m up to 2m tall. The frame has the option to add mudguards and a rack, increasing its versatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £499</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fhybrid-bike-riverside-700-grey-sea%2F_%2FR-p-341646\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon (£449.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Elops 500 City Bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-970x565.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-970x565.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-300x175.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-768x447.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-1536x895.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-2048x1193.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-750x437.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/city-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey-1140x664.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Decathlon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Decathlon sells some very well-specced bikes for bargain prices and its Elops 500 City Bike is a case in point. Not only do you get full mudguards and a rack, there’s a kickstand and even lighting powered by a Shimano Nexus hub dynamo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1×9-speed drivetrain uses Microshift components and has a 1:1 lowest gear and the City Bike rolls on 38mm tyres. The only compromise is the use of V-brakes rather than more powerful and weatherproof disc brakes. There’s a step-through frame available as well as the version with a top tube shown above.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £500</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26895&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2Fcity-bike-elops-500-step-over-grey%2F_%2FR-p-305016%3Fmc%3D8526940%26c%3Dgrey_blue\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon (£500)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Merida Crossway 10-V</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-970x603.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-970x603.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-300x186.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-768x477.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-1536x954.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-2048x1272.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-750x466.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/CROSSWAY_10_slvblk_MY2022-1140x708.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Merida</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re worried about cycling comfort, the Merida Crossway may be the bike for you, as it has both a 63mm travel suspension fork and a suspension seatpost with 40mm of travel to help cushion the ride. It’s equipped with a Shimano Altus 3×7-speed drivetrain with a Shimano Altus rear derailleur. The 14-28 tooth cassette paired with the 48/38/28 tooth crankset combination gives plenty of gear range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the bike isn’t delivered with them, there are mounts for both mudguards and a rack for all-weather commuting duties, while the height-adjustable stem allows the Crossway’s handlebars to be set up to suit your height and ride style.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £500</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ridgeback Comet</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/02212859/ridgeback_comet-970x632.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After years testing bikes, my advice is still usually to get a red one. The Ridgeback Comet fits the bill. However, there are plenty of reasons to buy it beyond the colour. Like the light aluminium frame, easy to maintain single-chainring drivetrain and simple to operate twist-to-change gear shifter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Comet does without disc brakes and instead uses the older V-brake standard. That means you’ll find yourself with slightly reduced braking power, plus more maintenance down the line, the flipside being lower overall weight and a bit more cash left in your pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £500</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Voodoo Marasa</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"740\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/452894.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/452894.jpg 740w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/452894-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/452894-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/452894-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Voodoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in men’s and women’s versions, the Voodoo Marasa is a hybrid that looks like it might be ready to escape the city. With semi-knobbly 38mm tyres, it’s quick on the road but capable of taking a sideways slide and tackling the odd trail too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stopped by Clarks Clout hydraulic disc brakes, its rigid construction is light and simple. Despite the lack of suspension, its geometry also tilts towards the rowdy, with a relaxed head angle that helps keep everything stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Possessing a decent kit list and a keen price, the Marasa is a great hybrid for mixed commutes – or playing about on when the weekend rolls around.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: £500</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the men’s version now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Fvoodoo-marasa-mens-hybrid-bike---m-l-frames-452894.html\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords (£500)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Buy the women’s version now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Fvoodoo-marasa-womens-hybrid-bike---m-l-frames-452918.html\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords (£500)</a></strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for in a hybrid bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comfortable touchpoints</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The key item to look for is a comfortable saddle. That’s not necessarily the most squishy, as it’s usually better to have a firmer saddle with better support for more efficient pedalling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s probably not the widest either, although the requirements for male and female riders differ due to their different sit bone anatomy. A saddle that’s too wide may chafe and be uncomfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bar grips also need to be firm rather than too thin or too soft and need to provide grip when damp. Lock-on grips will stay in position and won’t twist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, your pedals need to be comfortable. If you want to ride in normal shoes, they need to provide enough support and grip and not cut into your feet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, all these touchpoints can be swapped out relatively inexpensively if you do find they’re not right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tough tyres</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/the-cyclist-guide-to-inner-tube-repair\" target=\"_blank\">Punctures </a>are a sad fact of life for bike riders, but well-protected tyres can help. Look out for puncture protection layers and decent tread thickness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wider tyres can be run at lower pressures and so provide a little more comfort to your ride by smoothing out uneven road surfaces, as well as possibly more grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Decent gear range</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What constitutes ‘decent’ depends very heavily on where you’re riding. If where you live is fairly flat, you might only need a few gears or might even be comfortable with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-single-speed-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">single-speed bike</a>. If you’ve got hills, you’ll want more gears to make climbing them more comfortable. Many lower priced hybrid bikes have a triple crankset. This is more tricky to keep working well than a single or double crankset, but should give you plenty of low gearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mudguards, a rack, lights and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although many hybrid bikes can be bought with at least one of these fitted, you may find that you need to buy these separately, particularly with budget priced machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rack will allow you to fit <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/buyers-guide-the-best-bicycle-panniers\" target=\"_blank\">panniers</a>, which you may find to be a more comfortable way to carry luggage than a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-commuter-bags\" target=\"_blank\">backpack</a>. Panniers will also add stability by lowering your centre of gravity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re riding in low light, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/accessories/lights\" target=\"_blank\">lights </a>are a legal necessity. In an urban environment, they’ll increase your visibility while it’s a good idea to run them <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-daytime-riding-bike-lights\">even during the day</a> to make those around you more aware of your presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A kickstand can also be useful if you want to leave your bike somewhere, while a quality <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-choosing-the-best-bike-lock\" target=\"_blank\">bike lock</a> is a must to help to make sure that the bike is still there when you come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Need some help with bike jargon?
