Now brain activity during the deepest sleep phase could make it possible for people to communicate with the waking world during lucid dreaming.</p>\n<p>If someone is lucid dreaming, they are aware they are dreaming and able to manipulate what happens in the dream. Sleep expert Michael Raduga of Phase Research Center has developed a “language” that’s intended to allow people to communicate while in that state. Called Remmyo, the first language of its kind, it relies on specific facial muscle movements that can occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Remmyo can be learned during waking hours like any other language. Anyone capable of lucid dreaming could potentially communicate in Remmyo while asleep.</p>\n<p>“You can transfer all important information from lucid dreams using no more than three letters in a word,” Raduga, who founded Phase Research Center in 2007 to study sleep, told Ars. “This level of optimization took a lot of time and intellectual resources.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937559#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937559&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"488c142b5bc0cce278ada0a5ed1987ab7428696b90dacd51355fbc0efca9d9e8","category":"Tech"}
