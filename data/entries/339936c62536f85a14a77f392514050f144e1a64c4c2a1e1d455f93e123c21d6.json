So too, it seems <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2022/09/nerd-alert-dropper-posts-for-gravel-bikes-yay-or-nay/\">that folks want dropper posts for their gravel bikes</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Bike Yoke REVIVE 272 dropper post has arrived specifically for that reason.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BikeYokeREVIVE272dropper_backprofile-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"BikeYokeREVIVE272dropper_backprofile\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" /><figcaption><span>The REVIVE 272 features a reset valve trigger. This acts as a reset of sorts to bleed air out of the hydraulic cartridge without having to take apart the whole dropper.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/opening-day-at-the-taipei-cycle-show-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Opening day at Taipei Cycle Show 2023</a></p>\n<p><span>BikeYoke says the REVIVE 272 isn’t just a downsized REVIVE dropper but a hybrid of the REVIVE and the ultralight DIVINE SL dropper. It takes a forged, and CNC’d one-piece mast and a heavily-machined lower leg tube made of aluminum. This is paired with a slimmed down dropper internal for bikes with a 27.2mm seatpost diameter.</span></p>\n<p><span>The REVIVE 272 features an 80mm drop, just like the DIVINE SL. They’ve found that most gravel riders don’t need more than that. And considering how much success they’ve seen with an 80mm drop with the DIVINE SL, they see it as a-ok.</span></p>\n<p><span>Each REVIVE 272 dropper comes in a 400 mm length, which is longer than necessary for most gravel bikes. BikeYoke says this is for XC MTBs that tend to have shorter seat tubes even though the DIVINE SL internals are highly compact.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BikeYokeREVIVE272dropper_hero-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"BikeYokeREVIVE272dropper_hero\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" /><figcaption><span>The REVIVE 272 adds graphics around the dropper’s collar that the DIVINE SL doesn’t have.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Don’t need a full 400mm length post? Bike Yoke says you can cut up to 100mm off the total length without compromising the 80mm drop, a savings of 45g. Quoted weight for a standard BikeYoke REVIVE 272 dropper is 385g or 375g with titanium bolts. Cut the dropper post to 300mm, and a REVIVE 272 dropper weighs just 340g or 330g with titanium bolts.</span></p>\n<p><span>Compared to the competition, the REVIVE 272 is up to 200g lighter than the <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2021/08/rockshox-goes-gravel-with-rudy-xplr-suspension-fork-and-reverb-xplr-dropper/\" target=\"_blank\">Rockshox Reverb AXS XPLR</a> dropper post. It is, however, competitively light against the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2022/06/enve-g-series-dropper-seatpost/\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE G-Series dropper</a> and KS LEV Carbon Ci. Want something that won’t lighten your wallet so much? The <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2020/11/review-easton-ea70-ax-gravel-dropper-takes-you-50mm-closer-to-fun/\" target=\"_blank\">Easton EA70 AX dropper</a> seems to be the ticket.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Fox Transfer SL dropper is slightly lighter than a cut-down REVIVE SL, but the Fox dropper lacks the infinite adjustability of the BikeYoke option.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BikeYokeREVIVE272dropper_fullbikeprofileCervelo-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"BikeYokeREVIVE272dropper_fullbikeprofileCervelo\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" /><figcaption><span>The REVIVE 272 dropper post fully extended.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Like other Bike Yoke droppers, the REVIVE 272 will have spare parts available and should be easily serviceable for the end user without special tools. Additionally, there are no gravel-specific levers available by BikeYoke. Rather, they point folks toward the other options on the market to fit your riding style.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you have the good fortune of fitting a high-end dropper post on your gravel bike, the new REVIVE 272 should prove to be a good option. BikeYoke droppers are well-known for their durability and repairability, and the promises made here continue that trend. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just make sure you’re comfortable cutting down your fancy new seatpost.</span></p>\n<p><span>Pricing: $370 US / €370 / AUD unknown</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/REVIVE_272_real_weight-2-1340x1837.jpeg?width=730\" alt=\"REVIVE_272_real_weight-2\" width=\"1340\" height=\"1837\" /><figcaption><span>Proof of weight accuracy, courtesy of BikeYoke.</span></figcaption></figure>","author":"Alvin Holbrook","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"339936c62536f85a14a77f392514050f144e1a64c4c2a1e1d455f93e123c21d6","category":"Cycling"}
