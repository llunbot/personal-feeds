Apple says the wallpaper features colorful stripes that change position as users move, lock, or unlock their devices. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Carrier Satellite Connectivity on iPhone 13</h2>\r<br />\nStarting with iOS 18.5, carrier-provided satellite connectivity services <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/t-mobile-starlink-public-beta-for-iphones/\">like T-Mobile Starlink</a> are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/ios-18-5-satellite-connectivity-iphone-13/\">supported on all four iPhone 13 models</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-18-Carrier-Satellite-SAT.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"200\" />\r<br />\nThese satellite services allow you to send and receive text messages when cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity is unavailable, in supported areas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's own satellite feature remains limited to iPhone 14 models and newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Screen Time Passcode Notifications</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.5 includes a useful change for the Screen Time parental feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Screen-Time-iOS-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nSpecifically, Apple says that parents will now receive a notification when their Screen Time passcode is successfully entered on their child's device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis change will allow parents to be alerted immediately if their child has correctly guessed or figured out the Screen Time passcode, which can allow the child to turn off or adjust the restrictions that were set by their parents.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nScreen Time launched in 2018 as part of iOS 12, providing parents with settings to remotely manage a child's device. For example, parents can restrict device usage to certain times, set time limits for apps, and block inappropriate content.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mail and Settings Tweaks</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Mail app, you can now easily turn off contact photos directly within the app, by tapping on the circle with three dots in the top-right corner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/mail-categories-ios-18-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\niOS 18.5 also makes the \"All Mail\" button slightly visible on the screen, for users who might not have realized that you can scroll over to it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the Settings app, AppleCare+ coverage information is more prominent.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/applecare-logo-ios-18-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Release Notes</h2><blockquote>This update also includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:\r<br />\n<ul><li>A new Pride Harmony wallpaper</li>\r<br />\n<li>Parents now receive a notification when the Screen Time passcode is used on a child's device</li>\r<br />\n<li>Buy with iPhone is available when purchasing content within the Apple TV app on a 3rd party device</li>\r<br />\n<li>Fixes an issue where the Apple Vision Pro app may display a black screen</li>\r<br />\n<li>Support for carrier-provided satellite features is available on iPhone 13 (all models).</li></ul></blockquote>iOS 18.5 will be available in the Settings app under General â†’ Software Update.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-18-5-expected-this-week/\">iOS 18.5 Expected This Week With These New Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-5-expected-this-week-with-these-new-features.2456924/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce757cab3a2e2f6aa7a4e832ae9aaf2f65f558b9218823af442a46a37692c08d","category":"Apple"}
