You have to wait until it expires","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629695/want-to-renew-applecare-you-have-to-wait-until-it-expires.html","date":1741942800000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>My spouse’s notes indicated the AppleCare+ coverage on her iPhone was ending within a few weeks. Try as she might, she couldn’t find a way to renew coverage even though Apple’s documentation and her Apple Account said it could be extended. We finally called Apple: the answer was that until coverage expired, it couldn’t be re-upped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read Apple’s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/101560\">main support note on the topic</a>, the company does tell us that–in anything but plain language. “If you paid upfront for an AppleCare+ plan, you might be able to purchase new coverage within 45 days after your original coverage ends.” Note that it says <em>within 45 days after</em>, which implies any period of time before that, but it is literal here: only from 0 to 45 days of expiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once AppleCare+ expires, your iPhone, iPad, or Mac starts alerting you with a badge on Settings or System Settings and a banner within settings about renewing AppleCare+. That was the case for my partner, who saw the banner a day after its expiration and was then able to renew it. She also received an email that day.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-picture-applecare-renewal-sm.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-picture-applecare-renewal-sm.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-picture-applecare-renewal-sm.png?resize=300%2C194&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-picture-applecare-renewal-sm.png?resize=768%2C497&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-picture-applecare-renewal-sm.png?resize=1200%2C777&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"777\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>You’re warned in advance about an upcoming AppleCare+ expiration (left, bottom) but can’t do anything about it.

Some renewals can be extended one month at a time; others, only by a year for each renewal. Coverage ends forever if you miss the 45-day window (30 days in China).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To renew AppleCare+ on a device or for other hardware, including devices that lack a display:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>On an iPhone or iPad, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>AppleCare &amp; Warranty</em> and tap the name of your device.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On a Mac, go to  &gt; <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>AppleCare &amp; Warranty</em> and click the name of your device.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in to your Apple Account at <a href=\"https://mysupport.apple.com/\">mysupport.apple.com</a> and click your device. Click “Show all my devices” if it’s not displayed at the top.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In both places, you’ll see a list of your hardware. If AppleCare+ is active, it’s noted with a label underneath: AppleCare+ or AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss. You can use the device details above to access support options: on an iPhone or iPad, tap <em>Open</em> for the Apple Support app (or install and return); on a Mac, click <em>Details</em>, which opens the Apple Support page for the product, first having you log in if you haven’t recently done so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If AppleCare+ has lapsed, you see either Coverage Expired (iPhone, iPad, or Mac) or the serial number (Apple Support site).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-list-of-coverage-mac-bordered.png?w=1158\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-list-of-coverage-mac-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1436w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-list-of-coverage-mac-bordered.png?resize=290%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 290w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-list-of-coverage-mac-bordered.png?resize=768%2C796&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-list-of-coverage-mac-bordered.png?resize=1158%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1158w\" width=\"1158\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>You can find your coverage  through macOS System Settings (shown), iOS/iPadOS Settings, and the Apple Support website.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these steps if you have an option to renew:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click or tap <em>Renew AppleCare+</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose a monthly or annual renewal if the option is provided.
