Apple had been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/report-apple-is-testing-usb-c-iphone-models-for-2023/\">signaling for months</a> that it intended to switch ports, at least in part to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/iphones-to-require-usb-c-charging-by-2024-under-eu-agreement/\">conform with new regulations from the EU</a> and elsewhere that required them to do it.</p>\n<p>With the USB-C transition essentially taken for granted, the rumor mill focused on Apple’s implementation of USB-C, namely that the company <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/28/usb-c-iphone-speeds/\">would limit data</a> and <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/02/28/iphone-15-to-require-certified-accessories-for-full-access-to-usb-c\">charging speeds</a> for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/\">any accessories</a> not certified through its <a href=\"https://mfi.apple.com/\">Made for iPhone (MFI) program</a>. Without certified cables, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/\">the rumors said</a>, other USB-C accessories would be limited to basic functionality, like 480Mbps USB 2.0 transfer speeds and slower charging speeds. (Reporting from MacStories indicates that the new iPhones <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/apples-september-2023-event-all-the-small-things/\">support 20 W fast charging</a>, though faster speeds <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/iphone-14-and-14-pro-charging-speeds\">may be possible with higher-wattage adapters</a>; the iPhones can also provide up to 4.5 W of power to a connected accessory like the USB-C AirPods case.) Officially licensed Lightning cables use <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/12/10/16/lightning-cables-authentication-chip-found-to-offer-just-enough-security\">a small controller chip</a> to verify authenticity, and cables without them <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/101565\">can generate error messages</a> and refuse to work.</p>\n\n<p>But this USB-C rumor was always difficult to believe, partly because Apple has been shipping fully standards-compliant USB-C ports in its Macs and iPads for years now. If anything, I’ve found Apple’s USB-C ports to be <em>less</em> temperamental than those that come in some PCs—I’ve used HP and Lenovo PCs that either complain about slow charging or reduce performance if you use third-party chargers with them, but my MacBooks have always happily connected to whatever charger I wanted to use them with.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968035#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968035&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"65150d733032aaf1e999503683bdab98bb7a0901c49d18391df384f25eb6a7be","category":"Tech"}
