The new iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inch and 13 inch, features the M4 chip, better display technology, and much more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are updating this story.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Original story follows. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current iPad range is one of the most populated we’ve seen. It includes two iterations of the standard iPad, the iPad mini, the iPad Air, and the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, so there’s plenty to choose from. It seems Apple isn’t stopping there, though; rumors suggest it could be adding an even larger iPad Pro to the line-up. Here’s everything we know about the next-generation iPad Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Apple will be holding an event today – May 7 – named Let Loose. Apple is expected to unveil two new iPad Pro models.

A new Magic Keyboard is also expected. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is hosting a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">Spring Event</a>, known as the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2312605/surprise-apple-announces-let-loose-event-on-may-5.html\">Let Loose event</a> on May 7 at 7 am PT (3 pm BST). We expect the iPad Pro will be unveiled at the event alongside <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">new iPad Air models</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This matches rumors that the new device will ship in May. A March report from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg claimed that the iPad Pro would<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2282952/ipad-pro-ipad-air-launch-shipping-may-2024.html\"> ship in May</a>. In an April report where we said it will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2290228/new-ipads-probably-arrive-week-of-may-6-trusted-analyst.html\">“probably” ship the week of May 6</a>. And on May 6 he reiterated this saying that there will be four new iPad models (including two new iPad Pro and two new iPad Air). A new Magic Keyboard is also expected.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Final Cut Pro for the iPad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Final Cut Pro for the iPad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Final Cut Pro for the iPad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iPad-Final-Cut-Pro.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 iPad Pro display: Apple’s first OLED tablet is coming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current LED (on the 11-inch model) and mini-LED (on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro) are set <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2136057/giant-ipad-air-more-expensive-oled-ipad-pro.html\">to be replaced by OLED</a>, according to Ming-Chi Kuo in November 2023. The iPad Pro will be the first iPad to transition to OLED displays, with the rest of the iPad lineup to follow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in December 2022, Display analyst Ross Young suggested that Apple is planning to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432997/macbook-air-ipad-pro-oled-displays-2024.html\">move the entire iPad line to OLED</a> by 2024. This matches what Gurman wrote when he predicted that “an updated design and OLED screens” would be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480996/major-ipad-pro-revamp-next-year.html\">coming to the iPad in the spring of 2024</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is yet more evidence that OLEDs are coming: market research company Omdia has also stated that the iPad Pro could see OLED upgrades by 2024. In addition, leaker Yeux1122 has claimed that Apple is in negotiations with LG, Samsung, and Chinese companies for active matrix OLEDs (AMOLEDs). More here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2102929/ipad-air-mini-pro-oled-display-rumors.html\">Apple may upgrade nearly every iPad with an OLED display.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 iPad Pro design: A thinner lighter model is on the way  </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A 9to5Mac report in February 2024 indicated that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2243489/ipad-pro-air-leak-dimensions-size-specs.html\">new iPad Pro will be thinner</a>. This is apparently a result of Apple’s switch to OLED for the screen, which will shave some millimeters off the thickness of the device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new dimensions are said to be as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>11-inch iPad Pro (2024): 249.7 mm x 177.5 mm x 5.1 mm </li>\n\n\n\n<li>11-inch iPad Pro (2022): 247.6 mm x 178.5 mm x 5.9 mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12.9-inch iPad Pro (2024): 281.5 mm x 215.5 mm x 5.0 mm </li>\n\n\n\n<li>12.9-inch iPad Pro (2022): 280.6 mm x 214.9 mm x 6.4 mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple does reduce the thickness of the iPad Pro it isn’t clear what this will mean for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">next-gen iPad Air</a>, which is reported to be getting a new larger model, making it even more like the iPad Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also regarding the design of the iPad Pro, a code snippet in the iOS 17.4 beta suggests that Apple might move the camera from portrait to landscape orientation like it has with the standard iPad. The code indicates that the FaceID setup could happen with the iPad in landscape orientation. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262063/2024-ipad-air-pro-camera-landscape-orientation.html\">a rumor in March 2024</a> claims that Apple was indeed moving the placement of the camera to the longer landscape edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>iOS 17.4 Beta 1 (21E5184i) changes:<br />1) Text hints at new iPads with horizontal Face ID Layout Even though it says 'iPad' this is most likely for the new iPad Pro due this March. <br />\"During Face ID setup, iPad needs to be in landscape with the camera at the top of the screen.\"<br /><br />2)… <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/NcmsH4J2NE&amp;xcust=1-1-1835319-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/NcmsH4J2NE</a></p>— Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1750641897381487014?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1835319-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">January 25, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 iPad Pro size: Is there going to be a 14-inch model? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, there are two sizes of iPad Pro: a 12.9-inch model and an 11-inch iPad Pro. Reports have suggested for years that Apple is working on a 14-inch model as a higher-end flagship model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumor of a larger-screened iPad started with Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman back in June 2021. He wrote that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349742/ipad-pro-14-inch-16-inch-rumors.html\">Apple was considering making iPads with larger displays</a>, but not to expect anything for a few years.  In December 2023 Gurman suggested the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2168151/12-inch-ipad-air-panel-shipments-2024-launch.html\">new iPad Pro could be 13-inches</a>. Another leaker named Majin Bu has also posted that a new 14.1-inch iPad Pro is in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Display analyst Ross Young also claimed in 2022 that a 14.1-inch iPad Pro model was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/784193/ipad-pro-14-1-inch-display-mini-led-promotion-2023.html\">in development</a>, and that “early 2023” was a likely release schedule. It appears that the tweet is no longer on Twitter/X, but initially, he tweeted in June 2022 that the 14.1-inch iPad Pro was  “confirmed” to be in development. However, it appears the release is either delayed or canceled and the larger model won’t arrive this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Apple is set to launch a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/new-ipad-air-6-rumors-release-date.html\">new 12.9-inch iPad Air in 2024</a>, so a 14-inch iPad Pro may make an appearance at some point, especially now that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1814473/final-cut-logic-pro-ipad-subscription-launch.html\">Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro are available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 iPad Pro price: How much will the 2024 iPad Pro cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, these are the starting prices for each model in the current <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-1835319-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Pro range</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Pro 11-inch Wi-Fi (2022): $799/£899</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 11-inch Cellular (2022): $999/£1,079</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch Wi-Fi (2022): $1,099/£1,249</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch Cellular (2022): $1,299/£1,429</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple moves to OLED screens and introduces a larger iPad Pro we may see a price hike. “If Apple wants to maintain the price gap between the iPad Air and iPad Pro to preserve its existing product segmentation strategy,” Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2136057/giant-ipad-air-more-expensive-oled-ipad-pro.html\">explained in a late-2023 report</a>, “it means that the new OLED iPad Pros may see a price increase.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2196113/massively-more-expensive-new-ipad-pro.html\">reports have claimed</a> the new iPad Pros will be “massively more expensive,” with prices starting at $1,499 for the 11-inch model and $1,800 for the 12.9-inch model. However, other reports say the price increase won’t be quite so large.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 iPad Pro: What specs and features will the 2024 iPad Pro have?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Processor:</strong> The current iPad Pros are powered by the M2 chip, so it makes sense for an M3 chip to appear in any new 2024 models. However, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2318178/shock-report-ipad-pro-m4-chip-not-m3.html\">a report by Mark Gurman</a> just a week before the “Let Loose” even claimed that “there is a strong possibility that the chip in the new iPad Pro will be the M4, not the M3.” He said Apple will postion the iPad Pro as an AI device thanks to the chip’s updated neural engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Storage is expected to remain the same. Apple currently sells 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB iPad Pro configurations, which is more than any other iPad and quite a lot of configurations when you consider all the color combinations and screen sizes. It’s possible that the company could change to starting with 256GB or 512GB at the entry-level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> The iPad Pro already has Wi-FI 6E, bit it’s possible that Apple makes the move to Wi-FI 7 as a way of future-proofing the iPad Pro, which likely won’t be updated until late 2025 or 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Camera: </strong>The M2 iPad Pro has a dual-camera system with 12MP Wide and 10MP Ultra Wide cameras. Apple will likely keep the same setup on the new model but could introduce new camera hardware and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 iPad Pro accessories: New Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 6, an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324613/let-loose-ipad-event-apple-pencil-pro.html\">“Apple Pencil Pro” reference was found on the Apple Japan website.</a> It’s not clear if this is a translation error or a reference to a new pro Pencil mistakenly left in the website’s code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman indicated in a September 2023 newsletter that Apple is planning a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2096970/ipad-mini-air-pro-rumors-specs-processor-upgrades.html\">aluminum Magic Keyboard</a> with a larger trackpad, that will be released alongside the M3 iPad Pro. The aluminum finish is said to make the iPad Pro feel more like a MacBook when docked.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll update this article as more details are revealed, so check back regularly to see what we dig up.
