{"title":"Apple Style Guide, March 2024 Edition","link":"https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/welcome/web","date":1711052955000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/20/apple-support-site\">Another</a> terrific resource from Apple’s documentation team, <a href=\"https://help.apple.com/pdf/applestyleguide/en_US/apple-style-guide.pdf\">also available as a PDF</a>. Apple has long made its style guide publicly available, but I suspect many people aren’t aware of it. The previous edition was from 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Worth noting though that this is <em>Apple’s</em> style bible, and while most of it is inarguably good advice, some of it is simply arbitrary. For example, Apple famously styles some of its product names without title-casing them: <em>Mac mini</em>, <em>iPod nano</em>, <em>macOS</em>, <em>visionOS</em>, <em>watchOS</em>, etc. That’s purely style though, not spelling, and my style — like most publications — is to capitalize proper names.</p>\n\n<p>A new entry, some of the idiosyncrasies of which many of you have likely already noticed in Apple’s marketing and documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>Apple Vision Pro</b> — Always use the full name. In general\n references, don’t use <em>the</em> with <em>Apple Vision Pro</em>. It’s OK to\n use another article or a possessive adjective: <em>Adjust the fit of\n your Apple Vision Pro</em>.</p>\n\n<p>You <em>put on</em> and <em>take off</em> Apple Vision Pro. When you have it on, \nyou’re <em>wearing</em> it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Put on Apple Vision Pro and adjust the fit. <br />\nDon’t run while you’re wearing Apple Vision Pro. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In text, don’t write the name <em>Apple Vision Pro</em> by combining the \n symbol with <em>Vision Pro</em>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Correct:</em> Get started with Apple Vision Pro. <br />\n<em>Incorrect:</em> Get started with Vision Pro. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don’t refer to Apple Vision Pro as a <em>headset</em>. In most cases, use \nthe product name; in content where the name is repeated \nfrequently, you can use <em>device</em>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Outside Cupertino, no one eschews <em>the</em> in front of Apple product names when doing so sounds natural, and everyone calls the Vision Pro a “headset”, because, well, it is a headset.</p>\n\n<p>(I keep thinking that if it had come out in the 1990s, it might have been named <em>AppleVision Pro</em>, closed-up and camel-cased, and also keep thinking that it kind of looks cool that way. Similarly: <em>AppleWatch</em>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/21/apple-style-guide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"62379aa63d3326584fdba25b49eb82ef9dd3164c2209bf2a38730ce511a17046","category":"Tech"}
