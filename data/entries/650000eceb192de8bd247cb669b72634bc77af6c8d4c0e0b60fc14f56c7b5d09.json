So if you are interested in running Windows programmes on your Mac, there is hardly any way around the Parallels software. The software is easy to install, convenient to use and offers some interesting functions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can set up your virtual machine (VM) in Coherence mode, in which the Windows desktop is hidden and your applications are run directly from your Mac desktop in a separate window, with important Windows tools such as the Start menu accessible via the menu bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the brand new Parallels version offers some other great features. These include Apple Intelligence compatibility as soon as macOS 15 Sequoia is released, shared folders and special optimisation for Windows 11 24H2 users. Thanks to Microsoft’s new Prism emulator, some older apps should even run up to 80 percent faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that Parallels Desktop 20 for Mac including Windows 11 Professional requires an ARM (M1/M2/M3) Mac. You cannot run the Home Edition on Apple’s M processors (still possible with Intel CPU). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further information on the virtualization tool Parallels Desktop can be found in our related articles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668146/parallels-desktop-review.html\">Parallels Desktop review</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668848/best-virtual-machine-software-for-mac.html\">Best virtual machine software for Mac</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670954/how-to-install-windows-on-mac.html\">How to install Windows on Mac</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Price comparison: This is how good the offer is</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard price for the 12-month subscription to <a href=\"https://www.parallels.com/lp/virtual-machines-for-mac/\" target=\"_blank\">Parallels Desktop 20 for Mac</a> is normally $89.99 per year, while the original <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-11-pro/dg7gmgf0d8h4?rtc=1\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 11 Pro licence</a> is available from Microsoft itself for $199.99.
