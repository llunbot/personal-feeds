One commenter described the iPod as \"far from revolutionary\" and another commenter wrote \"all this hype for something so ridiculous!\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, the iPod turned out to be one of the most important products in Apple's history and, along with the original iMac, helped the company become successful again after it flirted with bankruptcy in the late 1990s.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJobs famously pitched the iPod as offering \"1,000 songs in your pocket,\" and he unveiled the device by pulling it out of his own pocket.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"With iPod, Apple has invented a whole new category of digital music player that lets you put your entire music collection in your pocket and listen to it wherever you go,\" said Jobs in a press release. \"With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe iPod has since become a niche product for Apple, with the iPod touch being the only remaining model available for purchase today after the iPod classic was discontinued in 2014 and the iPod nano and iPod shuffle were discontinued in 2017. In fact, as of this week, the iPod touch's product page is only advertised in the footer of Apple's website.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's former senior vice president of the iPod team Tony Fadell <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/tony-fadell-reflects-on-ipod-20th-anniversary/\">reflected on creating the iPod</a> in an interview published yesterday.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/23/ipod-turns-20-anniversary/\">Today Marks the 20th Anniversary of the iPod</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/today-marks-the-20th-anniversary-of-the-ipod.2318787/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3KMHkSd4v3M:t5gQ7rP8gw0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3KMHkSd4v3M:t5gQ7rP8gw0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3KMHkSd4v3M\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4df5a2f915a91f7ff66c5a9e94f9ba4acce9722c9602e5250a5fb220e3a86084","category":"Apple"}
