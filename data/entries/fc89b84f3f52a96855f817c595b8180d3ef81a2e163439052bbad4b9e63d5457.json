I don't know what's making it.\"</p>\n<p>Wilmore said he was not sure if there was some oddity in the connection between the station and the spacecraft causing the noise, or something else. He asked the flight controllers in Houston to see if they could listen to the audio inside the spacecraft. A few minutes later, Mission Control radioed back that they were linked via \"hardline\" to listen to audio inside Starliner, which has now been docked to the International Space Station for nearly three months.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046651#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046651&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc89b84f3f52a96855f817c595b8180d3ef81a2e163439052bbad4b9e63d5457","category":"Tech"}
