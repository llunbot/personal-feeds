He didn’t want to sell it but was in a tough spot and needed the money. This frame was infamous by messenger standards. By the time I got the Fuji, it had passed through several other couriers. It was the only frame Swerve never broke before he sold it to Mongo (who still asks me about it to this day) and eventually ended up under John’s bed, stripped of paint and in need of a little more than a touch of tender loving care. This is the bike I learned to bomb hills, surf shoulder-width traffic, and eventually race track on.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1126\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-10.jpg?w=1126&amp;quality=75 1126w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-10.jpg?resize=1024,1819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-10.jpg?resize=768,1364&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-10.jpg?resize=700,1243&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-10.jpg?resize=865,1536&amp;quality=75 865w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1126\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-11.jpg?w=1126&amp;quality=75 1126w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-11.jpg?resize=1024,1819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-11.jpg?resize=768,1364&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-11.jpg?resize=700,1243&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-11.jpg?resize=865,1536&amp;quality=75 865w\" /></p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve raced on a KHS Aero Track, a Team Edition Raleigh Rush Hour Pro I won at the 2008 NACCC, there was a Giant Omnium Dustin Klein painted for me, multiple LOW// frames when I was sponsored by them, a Masi Coltello, another Giant Omnium I traded a blem P29 for and Danny Holloway’s old Rock Lobster. If they weren’t free/prizes, they were second hand at best. When my last Giant developed a crack in the seat tube, I lamented, searching for another frame. Frankly, I couldn’t afford to buy a new frame, and deals on used bikes were few and far between. Enter the rare $400 Craigslist score.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1126\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-2.jpg?w=1126&amp;quality=75 1126w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-2.jpg?resize=1024,1819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-2.jpg?resize=768,1364&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-2.jpg?resize=700,1243&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-2.jpg?resize=865,1536&amp;quality=75 865w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-3.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-3.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-3.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-3.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-3.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-3.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" /></p>\n<p>The parenthesis here is I hate how expensive people make cycling out to be. When I first started track racing, more than a few jeers came my way for bringing my stickered and toe-caged bike to the banks up next to multi-thousand-dollar bikes. It wasn’t until I started doing well people stopped commenting on my bike. Even today, my bike was the cheapest bike in the bunch by a country mile.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?resize=1024,577&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?resize=1335,752&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-15.jpg?resize=1536,865&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?resize=1024,577&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?resize=1335,752&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-16.jpg?resize=1536,865&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Recently at a Hellyer Wednesday race night, a friend was telling a novice rider they didn’t need to spend a lot on a race bike to get started. However, he continued, “when you get to Fergus’ level, you’ll want to spend as much as you can on your bike.” Insert a surprised emoji face here.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?resize=1024,577&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?resize=1335,752&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-6.jpg?resize=1536,865&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?resize=1024,576&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?resize=1335,751&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-5.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Maybe not the backhanded compliment it was meant to be, I was still taken aback. The irony was his handlebars there worth more than I spent on my bike. The perception of cycling having an economic barrier to entry is gross. You can’t preach inclusion while ignoring the obvious $10,000 special elephant in the room. The not-so-subtle moral being the more you spend the faster you’ll be. Blegh.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?resize=1024,577&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?resize=1335,752&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-13.jpg?resize=1536,865&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?resize=1024,577&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?resize=1335,752&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-14.jpg?resize=1536,865&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Yes, I’ve been lucky to get industry deals here and there.

Stripped of paint poorly photographed in a barren room on a hardwood floor was a listing for a raw carbon Fuji Elite- one of my more favorite frames after the Koga Kimera.  I took a chance and scooped up the frame almost without hesitation. I knew I couldn’t leave the frame raw, and I’m too cheap to paint it professionally. For $50 in carbon primer, Rustoleum and automotive clear, I managed to make the frame presentable enough to look fast, even if I wasn’t feeling fast.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?resize=1024,577&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?resize=1335,752&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/FujiElite-1.jpg?resize=1536,865&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Is there a line to be drawn between my first Fuji and my last?
