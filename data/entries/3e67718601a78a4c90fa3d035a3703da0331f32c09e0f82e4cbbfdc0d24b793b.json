{"title":"Bloomberg: iPhone 13 to Feature ProRes for Videos, ProMotion Displays, Portrait Mode Video, Smaller Notch, and More","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/iphone-13-pro-res-video-portait-mode/","date":1628594589000,"content":"The upcoming 2021 iPhones will feature a spate of new camera features tailored for professional users, including ProRes for videos, Portrait Mode for video, and design updates by the means of a smaller notch, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/apple-readies-new-iphones-with-pro-focused-camera-video-updates\">new report</a> from <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iPhone-13-Dummy-Thumbnail-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Gurman, Apple plans to include Portrait Mode video in this year's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup, which will allow users to record videos with an added bokeh effect behind the subject. Apple released Portrait Mode with the ‌iPhone‌ 7 Plus, but it's since remained exclusive to photos. It's worth noting that with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> this fall, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> will be gaining Portrait Mode for all compatible devices. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple first added Portrait mode to the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016, and it quickly become a fan favorite. The feature can put a person in sharp focus while blurring the background in what is known as a bokeh effect. For the new iPhones, Apple plans to add this same technique to video with a feature internally dubbed Cinematic Video. Like with still photos, the iPhone's depth sensor will create the effect and allow users to change the amount of blur after recording.</blockquote>Alongside Portrait Mode video, Apple is also planning to bring ProRes for videos to the ‌iPhone‌, which will allow users to record video in a higher quality format and offer more editing controls. Similar to how ProRaw for photos is exclusive to only the higher-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models, <em>Bloomberg</em> says that ProRes may also be exclusive to only the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, Apple is also planning a more advanced iteration of standard photo filters for photographers with its upcoming iPhones. Instead of applying a filter to the entire photo, the upcoming iPhones will precisely apply \"changes to objects and people across the photos using artificial intelligence.\"\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Users will be able to choose from several styles to apply to their photos, including one for showing colors at either a warmer or cooler temperature while keeping whites neutral. Another option will add a more dramatic look with deeper shadows and more contrast, and the company is planning a more balanced style for showing shadows and true-to-life colors with a brighter appearance.</blockquote>Gurman today also reconfirmed that the upcoming iPhones will feature a faster A15 chip, a smaller notch, and new display technology that will enable a higher 120Hz refresh rate. Gurman had previously noted that on the higher-end models of the ‌iPhone 13‌, Apple might also introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/18/iphone-13-always-on-display/\">always-on capabilities similar to the Apple Watch</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/iphone-13-pro-res-video-portait-mode/\">Bloomberg: iPhone 13 to Feature ProRes for Videos, ProMotion Displays, Portrait Mode Video, Smaller Notch, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-iphone-13-to-feature-prores-for-videos-promotion-displays-portrait-mode-video-smaller-notch-and-more.2307085/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WUK-O5Qi9SA:TZJfgPT_5C4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WUK-O5Qi9SA:TZJfgPT_5C4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/WUK-O5Qi9SA\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e67718601a78a4c90fa3d035a3703da0331f32c09e0f82e4cbbfdc0d24b793b","category":"Apple"}
