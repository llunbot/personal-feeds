We will make the My Number Card available in Apple Wallet from the second half of next spring, and we will present your ID while making full use of the security and privacy protection features built into the iPhone. We are very pleased to provide a convenient and convenient way for everyone living in Japan,\" said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.</blockquote>Once loaded into Apple Wallet, a user's My Number Card can be accessed within the app by authenticating with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, and the ID can then be presented either face-to-face or to a card reader, enabling access to medical services, governmental services, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/30/tim-cook-japan-user-privacy-discussions/\">discussed My Number Card integration</a> during one of Cook's trips to Japan back in late 2022. At the time, Cook said Apple had some concerns over user privacy and security around the IDs, but it appears those concerns have been satisfied to a sufficient enough degree that Apple is now on board with supporting the IDs in its centralized Wallet app. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/\">Japan</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/japan-my-number-card-apple-wallet/\">Japanese 'My Number Card' Digital IDs Coming to Apple's Wallet App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/japanese-my-number-card-digital-ids-coming-to-apples-wallet-app.2427716/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1b0aa23d5c8299dec6494780fe1c9b85679ca5aee370b162908c2332951565f7","category":"Apple"}
