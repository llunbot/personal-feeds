These fall within the threshold generally considered acceptable for consumer-grade fitness devices. In contrast, the average error for energy expenditure was 27.96%, more than three times the margin considered acceptable for accurate measurement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe analysis incorporated data from studies spanning multiple Apple Watch models and user groups. The high error margin in calorie estimation was consistent across all cohorts and forms of physical activity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>These devices are great for keeping track of habits and staying motivated. But do not take every number as 100% truth, especially the calories. Think of it as a helpful guide, not a diagnostic tool. It is useful but not perfect.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe findings align with previous independent evaluations that have raised concerns about the reliability of calorie burn estimates from consumer-grade wearable devices like Apple Watches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the Apple Watch has undergone continuous generational improvements since its debut in 2015, the researchers noted that even newer models still exhibit considerable error in calorie estimation. However, the study did observe a trend toward improved accuracy in more recent models:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>While we cannot say every update is a big leap forward, there is a noticeable trend of gradual improvements over time. It shows that Apple is refining the technology over time.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe researchers emphasized that their analysis is not intended to discredit the utility of wearables, but rather to clarify their limitations and inform both consumers and smartwatch makers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>By showing where the weaknesses are, we can help developers get real feedback. If they know what needs to be fixed, they can design better sensors or algorithms. Our findings can guide improvements and help make these devices more useful for both everyday users and health care providers.\r<br />\n</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple does not publish the algorithms used in Apple Watch fitness tracking, nor does it claim that the device provides clinical-grade energy expenditure measurements. The company has consistently positioned the Apple Watch as a general wellness tool rather than a medical diagnostic device, though it has introduced several advanced health features in recent years, such as body temperature monitoring and sleep apnea detection.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/activity/\">Activity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/activity-trackers/\">Activity Trackers</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/apple-watch-gets-fitness-metric-wrong/\">Apple Watch Gets One Crucial Fitness Metric Wrong, Researchers Say</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-gets-one-crucial-fitness-metric-wrong-researchers-say.2458239/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"30e8ec1cd15ea7fceb9b060930a45f4ae7c99aba488624865339009a386d9fd0","category":"Apple"}
