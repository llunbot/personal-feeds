Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>Approximately 200 miles north of Rome, outside Bologna, lies the small town of Sant'Agata Bolognese, notable as the home of Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. I recently visited the town and factory, ostensibly to learn about Lamborghini's early sustainability efforts as the supercar manufacturer transitions to hybridization and electrification over the next few years. But first, Lambo put that step into context by dropping me into a V12-powered Aventador SVJ for a drive through the Italian countryside.</p>\n<p>A jaunt through busy Bologna and the surrounding roads in such a track-focused Aventador quickly reveals the soul of Lamborghini as an automakerâ€”raucous and enervating, all drama and sensory overload from start to finish. At first, the SVJ nags me as I upshift too soon or downshift too aggressively, but familiarity begins to inspire confidence.</p>\n<p>Stop-start traffic in this car borders on torture. Italian traffic impinges upon any hopes of driving at speed. Instead, stuck in lines of unidentifiable hatchbacks never sold in the United States, I navigate narrow roundabouts and merging lanes pinched by barricades and balustrades at nearly every intersection.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979552#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979552&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6d6884c8fe5317541540b875c0e5aedc31d906b075f222789fafa5f0b88b426","category":"Tech"}
