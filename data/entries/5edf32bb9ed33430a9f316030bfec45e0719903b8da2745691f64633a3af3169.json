Fewer than 10 years ago, dropper seatposts were a relative rarity, but it’s near impossible to find a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">mountain bike</a> without one now.</p>\n<p>A dropper post is a must-have these days if you’re riding anything remotely technical, opening up a far wider range of riding – without having to stop and manually move your post up and down when tackling steep trails.</p>\n<p>Our expert team of testers have reviewed dozens of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/\">dropper posts</a>, and this list represents the best of the best. Whether you’re looking to fit a dropper post to your bike for the first time or upgrade your current dropper, you’ll find something here.</p>\n<p>For more information, read our full <a href=\"#buyers-guide\">buyer’s guide to dropper posts</a> at the bottom of this article.</p>\n<h2>Crankbrothers Highline 7</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Crankbrothers Highline 7 dropper seatpost\" title=\"Crankbrothers Highline 7 dropper seatpost\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Once out on the trail, it was a top performer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £270 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 516g (without remote and cable)</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke length (* tested)</strong>: 100mm, 125mm*, 150mm, 170mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameters</strong>: 30.9mm, 31.6mm</li>\n<li><strong>Max length</strong>: 417mm (125mm travel)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crankbrothers has nailed nailed performance, reliability and ease of fitment with the Highline 7.</p>\n<p>The post’s construction screams quality and it was very simple to fit to our test bikes thanks to the cable’s nipple attaching to the post end, with the lever clamping the cable at the other end.</p>\n<p>The stack height – the distance from the bottom of the post’s collar to the centre of the seat rails – was impressively short at 50mm, too.</p>\n<p>Although the remote was £55 extra, we thought it was well worth it, thanks to its smooth action and adjustable angle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/crankbrothers-highline-7-dropper-post-review/\">Read our full Crankbrothers Highline 7 dropper post review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals for the Crankbrothers Highline</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>OneUp V2 Dropper Post</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"OneUp V2 Dropper Post and OneUp Dropper Post Remote V2\" title=\"OneUp V2 Dropper Post and OneUp Dropper Post Remote V2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The V2 has up to 210mm of drop.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £179 as tested (plus £42 for OneUp Dropper Post Remote V2)</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 579g (without remote and cable – remote: 48g)</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke length (* tested)</strong>: 120mm, 150mm, 180mm, 210mm*</li>\n<li><strong>Diameters (* tested)</strong>: 30.9mm*, 31.6mm, 34.9mm</li>\n<li><strong>Max length</strong>: 554mm (210mm travel)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The OneUp V2 dropper features an exceptionally compact post body, seal head and seat clamp.

This means fewer seals, less friction and less to go wrong, but it does mean the oil can mix with the air resulting in sponginess. A 4mm bolt underneath the saddle clamp makes it easy to refresh the post, but the necessity of this could be offputting for some.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/bikeyoke-revive-2-review/\">Read our full BikeYoke Revive 2.0 dropper post review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Bontrager Line Elite</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bontrager Line Elite dropper seatpost for mountain bikes\" title=\"Bontrager Line Elite dropper seatpost\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Bontrager Line Elite comes with a dropper lever included.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £300 / $330 / AU$440/ €350 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight</strong>: 558g</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke length (* tested)</strong>: 100mm, 130mm, 150mm, 170mm*</li>\n<li><strong>Diameters (* tested)</strong>: 30.9mm, 31.6mm*, 34.9mm</li>\n<li><strong>Max length</strong>: 340mm (100mm travel), 400mm (130mm travel), 440mm (150mm travel), 480mm (170mm travel)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Bontrager Line Elite is the higher-specced of two dropper seat posts from the brand, with the lower being the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/seatpost-and-seat-pin/bontrager-drop-line-dropper-seatpost-review/\">Bontrager Drop Line</a>.</p>\n<p>This model has Bontrager’s MaxFlow cartridge, which makes for faster and smoother action.</p>\n<p>The price includes a dropper lever, which works with Shimano I-spec and SRAM Matchmaker levers, but we found the lever to feel spongy when using it in testing.</p>\n<p>This dropper post has a greater stack height than others at 62mm, providing less clearance when the post is dropped.</p>\n<p>A nice touch is the adjustable travel height.

You do have to buy that separately at £69 on top of the £369 post cost, which seems steep given its average, wobbly-from-new design.</p>\n<p>Fox recently announced the addition of a 175mm stroke length post to the Transfer lineup, which is compatible with the Race Face 1x lever, and the new post and remote will cost the same as the other length models.</p>\n<p>The function is silky-smooth though, with excellent speed and position control. Every Transfer we’ve used has stayed that way indefinitely, no matter how bad the conditions or minimal the maintenance.</p>\n<p>That makes the high price a reasonable investment, and the Performance version skips the gold Kashima coating of the Factory post to save £50.

It’s been on the market for a while now, so we’ve had plenty of time to work out what it is – and isn’t – good at.</p>\n<p>Its large-diameter upper shaft means it flexes noticeably less than most posts when pedalling in longer lengths and on bikes with slack seat angles.</p>\n<p>The low weight will appeal to XC/trail riders, and there’s even a 27.2mm version (100mm stroke) for hardtails and older frames. It’s got a smooth and easily controlled stroke with a solid top-out thunk that leaves no doubt that it has re-extended.</p>\n<p>Pricing is okay too, with a 100/125mm model at £290, 150mm at £310 and 175mm at £340. KS’s shifter-style ‘Southpaw’ lever (£37 alloy, £59 carbon) is much nicer to use than the short ‘universal’ knuckle lever that comes as standard.</p>\n<p>The way that the post extends if you pick the bike up by the saddle is a pet hate of some people. We do still occasionally get LEVs that need a nudge or pull to extend them too, but that’s less common than it used to be.</p>\n<p>Our main criticism of the LEV is how the cable is mounted – it’s clamped at the post end instead of the lever.

Dropping your saddle down gives you much more space to get behind the seat on steep downhill sections, moving your weight back on the bike.</p>\n<p>Dropper posts aren’t just for getting rad on the descents – a tap of the remote lever pops your saddle back up to the correct height for efficient pedalling, all without having to stop.</p>\n<p>Having the ability to gain standover height is beneficial for nearly every type of mountain biking. In fact, even <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">cyclocross</a> riders are embracing the added control, where being able to switch quickly from grinding uphill to attacking a descent is essential.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How much travel do I need?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Brand-X Ascend XL dropper seatpost in position on mountain bike\" title=\"Brand-X Ascend XL dropper seatpost 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Longer-travel dropper posts are now more common.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Travel refers to how much the post slides up and down, and it dictates just how far out of the way you’ll be able to get your saddle while still having the best position for pedalling.</p>\n<p>Less expensive posts often have less travel. The longer the travel, the stronger and more precise the internal mechanisms have to be.</p>\n<p>The starting point for most dropper posts is 100mm. That amount of drop makes a noticeable difference, but we’ve found that longer-travel posts do a much better job of maximising the clearance while maintaining a proper seated pedalling height.</p>\n<p>The typical amount of drop is around 125mm to 170mm of travel, which works well for most riders.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"OneUp V2 Dropper Post and OneUp Dropper Post Remote V2\" title=\"OneUp V2 Dropper Post and OneUp Dropper Post Remote V2-2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All else being equal, a dropper seatpost with a lower stack height will enable you to spec a longer-travel option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>Longer-travel posts do exist, from 170mm up to 210mm, but they can be difficult to use for shorter riders or on certain bike frames. That said, longer-travel posts are becoming more and more common as technology improves and bike manufacturers design frames with shorter seat tubes.</p>\n<p>To figure out how long a drop you can use, measure your existing seatpost from the saddle rail to the top of seat collar, then compare this to the length of the dropper post from the saddle rail to below the post’s collar.</p>\n<p>If the number is the same or less, you’re in business. If the dropper post’s length is longer, you’ll have to use another option.</p>\n<h3>Fixed or infinite travel adjustment?</h3>\n<p>There are two travel styles for dropper posts: those that have fixed height settings where the post stops (20mm down, 75mm down, etc), and those that do not, often referred to as stepless or infinitely adjustable.</p>\n<p>Stepless posts enable you to stop the saddle anywhere within the post’s travel range. The majority of posts on the market are stepless designs.</p>\n<h3>Dropper seatpost internal workings</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"3 steps to service the DT Swiss D 232 dropper seatpost\" title=\"3 steps to service the DT Swiss D 232 dropper seatpost\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dropper post internals vary from very complex to relatively simple. The XC-focused DT-Swiss D-232 is one of the less complex options on the market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DT Swiss</i></span></div>\n<p>All posts require some sort of spring to return the saddle to the fully upright position and a locking mechanism to hold it in place.</p>\n<p>Early designs simply used coil springs and pins to do the job, but these were less refined and often returned the saddle back towards your bottom at an unnerving speed.</p>\n<p>You can still find mechanically locking designs with an air spring, but most dropper posts now use a fully sealed hydraulic cartridge that contains both a pressurised charge and a mechanism that allows the adjustment.</p>\n<p>There are a number of advantages to this, namely that the body of the post, which needs to cope with very heavy loads, doesn’t also have to be airtight and so lower-friction seals can be used for a lighter action.</p>\n<p>If something does go wrong with the post, it’s also much quicker and easier to switch in a replacement cartridge rather than repairing the entire post.</p>\n<h3>Dropper seatpost remotes</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"e*thirteen Vario Infinite dropper and e*thirteen Vario 1x Remote\" title=\"e*thirteen Vario Infinite dropper and e*thirteen Vario 1x Remote\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most dropper post remotes are sited on the handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>On most droppers, lowering the saddle is done by a handlebar-mounted remote.</p>\n<p>The remote lever commonly sits under the bar, taking the place of the front shifter paddles on bikes equipped with a single-ring drivetrain. On bikes with a front shifter, remotes that integrate into the lock-on grip collar or sit above the bar are available.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/sram-matchmaker-x/\">Matchmaker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-i-spec-a-b-and-ii-mounts-explained/\">Shimano’s I-Spec</a> standards allow you to combine a dropper and brake lever on one mount to keep the handlebar tidy.</p>\n<p>On bargain-priced dropper posts, the lever may be just under the saddle on the post’s head. The obvious downside to this style is having to take a hand off the bar, something you don’t want to do when riding into a section worthy of dropping the saddle.</p>\n<p>Most remotes on the market use a cable to operate them but some, such as the RockShox Reverb, use a hydraulic system.</p>\n<p>There are drawbacks and benefits to each. Cables are cheap and easy to replace if they fail, but over time they become stiffer to use as dirt enters them.</p>\n<p>That isn’t a problem for hydraulic units, but they are much harder to fix should you damage one in the field.</p>\n<h3>Cable routing</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"OneUp 27.2 gravel dropper post\" title=\"oneup-gravel-dropper-37\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> That cable has to go somewhere, and it’s usually through the guts of your frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>OneUp Components</i></span></div>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of dropper post cables are internally routed. This requires a hole in the frame to route the cable up through the seat tube – virtually every modern mountain bike, and the latest gravel bikes, have this option.</p>\n<p>The other cable option is an external cable that either attaches at the dropper post’s collar or up at the head where the saddle attaches.</p>\n<p>Benefits of an internally routed cable include clean looks, better protection from dirt and debris, and zero cable movement when dropping the post. But, like any internally routed cable, set up can be tricky, and swapping cables and housing can be a chore.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Magura Vyron MDS-V3 dropper post\" title=\"Magura Vyron MDS-V3 dropper post\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wireless dropper posts, such as the Magura Vyron or RockShox Reverb AXS, do away with cables.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Magura</i></span></div>\n<p>The upsides to an externally routed cable are compatibility with any frame and a simpler setup. The negatives deal primarily with cables that attach to the seatpost head, because the cable can interfere with the bike’s rear tyre or hit your leg if not routed carefully.</p>\n<p>The final option does away with the cable completely – the RockShox Reverb AXS is an example of a dropper post that uses a wireless, electronic system. Removing the mechanical cable from the equation makes installation easy and also makes swapping the seatpost from bike to bike a reality, provided they share the same seatpost diameter.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"5edf32bb9ed33430a9f316030bfec45e0719903b8da2745691f64633a3af3169","category":"Cycling"}
