Community creators who are invited by Twitter to participate can invite an unlimited number of users to their group.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMembers of a Community will see a new option to choose an audience in the tweet composer, allowing them to tweet to all of their followers or just to those followers who participate in the Community.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Communities are invite-only (also for now!) but admins and moderators have unlimited invites and members have 5 invites per Community (again, for now!) that are sent via DM<br /><br />so choose wisely (3/7) <a href=\"https://t.co/KTDnmhOB8T\">pic.twitter.com/KTDnmhOB8T</a></p>â€” Twitter Communities (@JoinCommunities) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoinCommunities/status/1435652985581867015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nTweets shared to a Community will show up in the Community and in the timelines of other members of the group. Communities are not private and can be viewed by others on Twitter, but only members can participate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn iOS devices, Communities can be accessed through the navigation bar, and on the web, there's a Communities option on the sidebar.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStarting today, there are a handful of Communities available such as #DogTwitter and #SkinCareTwitter, but Twitter is planning for more to be created each week and those interested in starting a Community can <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/communities-interest\">apply on the Twitter website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/08/twitter-launches-communities-feature/\">Twitter Launches Invite-Only Communities to Compete With Facebook Groups</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-launches-invite-only-communities-to-compete-with-facebook-groups.2310085/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8iRAGsRd3SY:46Ov6BfR22c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8iRAGsRd3SY:46Ov6BfR22c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/8iRAGsRd3SY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"45203cfe247929ec6b126384958f273d6582bc9d61d5799a03404ecd31e40385","category":"Apple"}
