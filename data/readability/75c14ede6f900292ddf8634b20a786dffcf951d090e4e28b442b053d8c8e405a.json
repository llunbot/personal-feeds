We remain committed to sustainable growth in cycling at every level by creating a safe and fair sporting environment that empowers equity, diversity and inclusion.</p><p>“While we intend to move forward with a series, we will only participate in a program guided by the teams and events; one which provides transparency on critical issues, and honors and complies with USAC and SafeSport code. The teams and events have a vested interest in the success of a national series and our hope is that together we can continue to build criterium racing in America.</p><p>“Finally, as planning and discussions are ongoing, we urge participating events to hold off on any decisions with regard to series participation. We ask that you stand with us, the teams, in our effort to create a safer, more unified program.
