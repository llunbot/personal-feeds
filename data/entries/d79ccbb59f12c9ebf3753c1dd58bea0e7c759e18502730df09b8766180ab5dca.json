With a 102t driver ratchet and six triple-stepped pawls, the points of engagement can be multiplied by six with the offset timing of each of each pawl, such that the hub will engage with only a 0.58823529° rotation of the freehub body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this prototype, only one pawl is truly engaged at any time, but we are told by Spank that there is enough flex in the system such that the torque transmitted through the drivetrain by the rider is enough to allow the other five pawls to also engage in a more “supporting” role.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"spank prototype hub 612 poes 6 pawls individually enagage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-612-poes-6-triple-stepped-pawls.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Timing of all six pawls is slightly offset such that only one pawl truly engages with the ratchet at any point</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spank are happy with the mechanism’s strength and durability for regular bikes, but are still testing its suitability for eBikes where higher torque levels can be sustained over longer periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"spank 612 poe hub prototype timing offset individual engagement with 102t ratchet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hub-612-poes-6-tripple-stepped-pawls.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>How does it compare? Well, the Spank prototype is a lot faster than the 3.5° engagement offered by the current <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spank-industries-hex-drive-hubs-offer-high-engagement-all-the-options-at-impressive-price/\" target=\"_blank\">Spank Hex</a> hub that offers just 102 POEs. And, it’s much faster than any star-ratchet based mechanism. But, it isn’t quite as fast as the 0.52° offered by <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/industry-nine-hydra-hubs-offer-mythical-performance-w-690-points-of-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">Industry Nine’s Hydra Hub</a>, or indeed the instant engagement delivered by <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ib17-onyx-shows-lighter-prototype-1-12-clutch-hubs-campy-fh-body-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Onyx</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"spank hex drive 102t 102poes 6 triple-stepped pawls current production hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spank-hex-drive-hubs-eurobike-2023-prototype-mechanism-612-poes.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spank Industries plan to bring the new new pawl arrangement to the next generation Hex hubs, with availability covering all common freehub drivers. This one is due in early 2024, and should come in at a price similar to the current Hex hubs. For reference, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spank-industries-hex-drive-hubs-offer-high-engagement-all-the-options-at-impressive-price/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2020</a>, Spank was selling its front and rear Hex hubs for $99 USD and $199 USD, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://spank-ind.com/\">spank-ind.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spanks-prototype-hub-612-poes/\">Spank’s 612 POE Prototype Hub Engages Every 0.59°</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d79ccbb59f12c9ebf3753c1dd58bea0e7c759e18502730df09b8766180ab5dca","category":"Cycling"}
