Hardware options are great, but getting useful computers out of them will require a lot of new software, and a big one has just launched: Chrome for Windows on Arm.</p>\n<p>Google has had a nightly \"canary\" build running <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-launches-chrome-nightlies-for-windows-11-on-arm/\">since January</a>, but now it has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/download-google-chrome-windows-pc-arm/\">a blog post</a> up touting a production-ready version of Chrome for \"Arm-compatible Windows PCs powered by Snapdragon.\" That's right, Qualcomm has a big hand in this release, too, with <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/03/fast--secure-and-native--chrome-comes-to-windows-on-snapdragon\">its own press announcement</a> touting Google's browser release for its upcoming chip. Google promises a native version of Chrome will be \"fully optimized for your PC’s [Arm] hardware and operating system to make browsing the web faster and smoother.\"</p>\n<p>Apple upended laptop CPU architecture when it dumped Intel and launched the Arm-based Apple Silicon M1. A few years later and Qualcomm is ready to answer—mostly by buying <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-closes-nuvia-deal-promises-in-house-laptop-cpus-by-2h-2022/\">a company full</a> of Apple Silicon veterans—with the upcoming launch of the Snapdragon X Elite chip. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/\">Qualcomm claims</a> the X Elite will bring Apple Silicon-class hardware to Windows, but the chip isn't out yet—it's due for a \"mid-2024\" release. Most of the software you'll be running will still be written in x86 and need to go through a translation layer, which will slow things down, but at least it won't have to be your primary browser.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012585#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012585&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61927a4a18b5ce6f99efa1ad60558b523ef05bc0424eaccc373788354c575a53","category":"Tech"}
