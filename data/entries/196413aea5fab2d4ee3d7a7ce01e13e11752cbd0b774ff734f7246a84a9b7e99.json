Unsurprisingly, it appears that opening and repairing the headset will be difficult.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"The EyeSight seems like a repair Achilles' heelâ€”so many points of failure for a slightly creepy feature,\" said iFixit, in an email. \"But we'll give Apple credit where it's due: the easily replaceable speakers and battery are big repairability wins.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro is powered by an M2 chip with an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, a 16-core Neural Engine, and 16GB of unified memory. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-tech-specs/\">Other specs include</a> up to 1TB of storage, and an all-new R1 chip that \"processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user's eyes.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe publication <em>Wallpaper*</em> <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-review\">had already shared</a> an image of the Vision Pro's internals on Friday, as part of an exclusive Vision Pro design interview with Apple's vice president of software design Alan Dye and vice president of hardware design Richard Howarth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Internals-1.jpg\" width=\"1360\" height=\"784\" /><div><em>Image Credit: Wallpaper*</em></div>\r<br />\nHowarth said Apple designed the Vision Pro with \"a lot of flexible materials and soft textures\" like the Solo Knit Band so that people \"would not only feel physically comfortable wearing it, but also enjoy wearing it around others too.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro launched on Friday in the U.S., and Apple said the headset will be available in additional countries later this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/\">Teardown</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/ifixit-apple-vision-pro-teardown/\">iFixit Shares Apple Vision Pro Teardown</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-apple-vision-pro-teardown.2418368/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"196413aea5fab2d4ee3d7a7ce01e13e11752cbd0b774ff734f7246a84a9b7e99","category":"Apple"}
