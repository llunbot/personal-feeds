Lawmakers expressed concern that TikTok's ties to China pose national security risks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTikTok is now <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1880820912058208494\">showing the following notice</a> to users who open the app in the country:<blockquote>A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!</blockquote>U.S. President Joe Biden's administration <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/17/statement-by-white-house-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-regarding-tiktok/\">on Friday said</a> that due to the timing of the TikTok ban taking effect, actions to implement the law must fall to the next administration. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office this Monday, January 20, and he reportedly might give TikTok a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-likely-give-tiktok-90-day-extension-avoid-ban-rcna188258\">90-day reprieve on the ban</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBiden believes TikTok should remain available in the U.S. under American ownership.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktokjan-17\">statement on Friday</a>, TikTok warned that the app would become unavailable due to the Biden administration's lack of intervention:<blockquote>The statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.</blockquote>TikTok has followed through with making the app unavailable, and Apple has now taken action too. Apple could have faced fines amounting to billions of dollars had it still offered access to the app from January 19.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTikTok has also been removed from the Google Play store on Android.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis saga is far from over.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/\">TikTok</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/18/apple-removes-tiktok-from-app-store-in-us/\">Apple Removes TikTok From App Store on iPhones and iPads in the U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-tiktok-from-app-store-on-iphones-and-ipads-in-the-u-s.2447687/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4853e498aca2719ea332b0931d1f48a0a6a7f36144674a8ccdc1cfa3cdda3593","category":"Apple"}
