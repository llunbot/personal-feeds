Unsurprisingly, it is the massive 512GB of RAM upgrade option that seems to be causing the longer wait here.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf ordered today, that configuration is estimated for delivery between March 26 and March 31, so there is currently a two- to three-week wait.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Thanks, Paul!</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/mac-studio-with-512gb-ram-delivery-delay/\">Mac Studio With Massive 512GB RAM Facing Two-Week Delivery Delay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-studio-with-massive-512gb-ram-facing-two-week-delivery-delay.2452919/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4d7f0ae8f4b424ed6d5a2397fbd0078b80eddf86b55bbd8e587bd9a2c75882a7","category":"Apple"}
