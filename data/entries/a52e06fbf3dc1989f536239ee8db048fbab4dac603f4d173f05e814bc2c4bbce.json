Ohio's \"Parental Notification by Social Media Operators Act\" affects websites including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube.</p>\n<p>\"Foreclosing minors under sixteen from accessing all content on websites that the Act purports to cover, absent affirmative parental consent, is a breathtakingly blunt instrument for reducing social media's harm to children,\" US District Judge Algenon Marbley wrote in an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ohsd.287455/gov.uscourts.ohsd.287455.27.0_1.pdf\">order</a> issued Tuesday. \"The approach is an untargeted one, as parents must only give one-time approval for the creation of an account, and parents and platforms are otherwise not required to protect against any of the specific dangers that social media might pose.\"</p>\n<p>While more in-depth arguments will be made later, Marbley called it \"unlikely that the government will be able to show that the Act is narrowly tailored to any ends that it identifies.\" Marbley, a judge in US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, granted a motion for a temporary restraining order sought by tech-industry lobby group NetChoice. Marbley did not rule on NetChoice's related motion for a preliminary injunction but scheduled a February 7 hearing on the injunction request.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995355#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995355&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a52e06fbf3dc1989f536239ee8db048fbab4dac603f4d173f05e814bc2c4bbce","category":"Tech"}
