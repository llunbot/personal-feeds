This year, they’re adding to it, but looking at it from the racing side of things with new hydration vests. There’s also big updates to the Raven and Raptor MTB packs, and lots of sizes for the frames bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-escapist-bikepacking-bags-01.jpg\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1822\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-escapist-bikepacking-bags-01.jpg\" alt=\"different sizes of osprey frame bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-escapist-bikepacking-bags-01.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-escapist-bikepacking-bags-01-231x300.jpg 231w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-escapist-bikepacking-bags-01-92x120.jpg 92w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-escapist-bikepacking-bags-01-768x999.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-escapist-bikepacking-bags-01-1180x1536.jpg 1180w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ranging from $80 to $90, the Frame Bag comes in three sizes, with a smaller Wedge bag adding a bit of extra storage for $60. Combine them with the top tube bag, handlebar roll bag, and a roll-top saddle bag, and you’ve got a complete setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of them use a PFAS-free DWR coating and waterproof zipper with 100% recycled 210D nylon. Velcro straps attach them to the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-03.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-03-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"escapist hydration vest backpack for gravel cycling and racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-03.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Osprey’s original Escapist packs were larger, aimed at casual bikepacking. But with the top tube and wedge bags working great for long-distance gravel racers (and the growing popularity of such events), they needed a proper race vest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said a lot of riders were using their running vests, but now there’s a bike-specific option that adds some clever features. It’ll come in 3L and 6L sizes with a 1.5L hydration bladder inside. The 3L can stuff a few things in the main reservoir compartment, but the 6L gets a dedicated cargo section and tool-roll lower zip pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-02.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"972\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-02-1536x972.jpg\" alt=\"escapist hydration vest backpack for gravel cycling and racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-02-1536x972.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-02-297x188.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-02-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-02-768x486.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-02.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The front has two stretch mesh stash pockets (one on the 3L) in front of zippered mesh pockets that are sized for larger snacks, a phone, folded maps, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-01.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-01-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"closeup strap detail for escapist hydration vest backpack for gravel cycling and racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-escapist-velocity-gravel-racing-hydration-vest-packs-01.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adjustable side and chest straps help you dial in the fit.

Both will get a new, slimmer version of their Lid-Lock helmet capture. The new “handle” is a lot thinner, but a bit wider, which will make it easier to slide into narrower helmet air vents and also hold them more securely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Raptor (above) will come in 10L and 14L sizes. Both have zippered tool rool pockets on the bottom and a front stash pocket for jackets, but the 14L stacks a zippered cargo pocket in front of that:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-raptor-raven-hydration-packs-02.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-raptor-raven-hydration-packs-02-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"interior details of 2025 osprey raptor and raven mtb hydration packs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-raptor-raven-hydration-packs-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-raptor-raven-hydration-packs-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-raptor-raven-hydration-packs-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-raptor-raven-hydration-packs-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-osprey-2025-raptor-raven-hydration-packs-02.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the current Raptor/Raven bags had a front zippered storage pocket with the same two little mesh pockets and key hook, the zipper and access were on the side and made it hard to see what all was in there.
