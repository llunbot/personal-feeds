Then, hold your iPhone near the top of another iPhone, and a \"Share\" button will appear below the pass on your iPhone. Finally, tap on the \"Share\" button to send the pass to the other iPhone via AirDrop. Both iPhones must be updated to iOS 17.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile it is already possible to share many Wallet app passes via AirDrop, Messages, Mail, and more through the iOS sharing menu, this new feature aims to provide a quicker and more convenient method. It works similarly to NameDrop, an iOS 17 feature that lets users quickly share contact information by bringing two iPhones together.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature is mentioned in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ios-17-2-release-notes/\">iOS 17.2 release notes</a>: \"AirDrop improvements including expanded contact sharing options and the ability to share boarding passes, movie tickets, and other eligible passes by bringing two iPhones together.\" The software update is in the final stage of beta testing and should be released next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2 includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/\">many other new features and changes</a>, including a Journal app, spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, several improvements to the Messages and Weather apps, a Favorite Songs playlist in Apple Music, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/ios-17-namedrop-like-wallet-passes-sharing/\">iOS 17.2 Adds NameDrop-Like Feature for Sharing Boarding Passes, Movie Tickets, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-adds-namedrop-like-feature-for-sharing-boarding-passes-movie-tickets-and-more.2413092/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60cbff0d12d2ce1207d3124ce150d3bb42ed26eb5c1692854fd782a4fc997d96","category":"Apple"}
