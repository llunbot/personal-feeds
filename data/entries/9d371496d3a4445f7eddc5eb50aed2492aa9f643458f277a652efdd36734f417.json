The company updated <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-23H2\">its list of known Windows issues</a> to say that it has recreated the issue on its end and that it's <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-23H2#3291msgdesc\">currently working on a fix</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The VPN issue affects all currently supported versions of Windows: Windows 10 21H2 and 22H2; Windows 11 versions 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2; and Windows Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, and 2022.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says the problem was caused by update <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/april-9-2024-kb5036893-os-builds-22621-3447-and-22631-3447-a674a67b-85f5-4a40-8d74-5f8af8ead5bb\">KB5036893</a>, which was initially released on April 9, 2024. The update makes \"miscellaneous security improvements to internal OS functionality,\" among a few other minor changes. The company hasn't provided specific information on what's been broken or what needs fixing, noting only that PCs \"might face VPN connection failures\" after installing the update.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021278#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021278&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9d371496d3a4445f7eddc5eb50aed2492aa9f643458f277a652efdd36734f417","category":"Tech"}
