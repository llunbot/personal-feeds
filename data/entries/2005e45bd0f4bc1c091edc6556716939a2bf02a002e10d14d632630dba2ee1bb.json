{"title":"Kottke.org Is 25 Years Old Today and Jason Wrote About It","link":"https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-is-25-years-old-today","date":1678847434000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Kottke:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My love for the web has ebbed and flowed in the years since, but\nmainly it’s persisted — so much so that as of today, I’ve been\nwriting kottke.org for 25 years. A little context for just how\nlong that is: kottke.org is older than Google. 25 years is <em>more\nthan half of my life</em> , spanning four decades (the 90s, 00s, 10s,\nand 20s) and around 40,000 posts — almost cartoonishly long for a\nmedium optimized for impermanence. What follows is my (relatively\nbrief) attempt to explain where kottke.org came from and why it’s\nstill going.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A thought that occurred to me <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/03/11/ep-370\">when Jason was on my podcast this month</a> (you should listen! — it’s one of my favorite episodes ever): at 25, Kottke.org is over one-quarter as old as The New Yorker magazine, which was founded in 1925. I’ve grown up thinking The New Yorker had been around “forever”. That makes Kottke.org ... one-quarter of “forever” old? My mind boggles.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations, my friend. Here’s to 25 more.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/14/kottke-25\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2005e45bd0f4bc1c091edc6556716939a2bf02a002e10d14d632630dba2ee1bb","category":"Tech"}
