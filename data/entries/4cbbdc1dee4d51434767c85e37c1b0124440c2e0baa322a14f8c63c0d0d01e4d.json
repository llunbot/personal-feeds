{"title":"Update: Fixed the Kerning Problem With Those PDF Specimens for Microsoft’s New Office Fonts","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/aptos","date":1690072476000,"content":"\n<p>At the end of my piece yesterday regarding Microsoft’s new Office fonts, I noted that the kerning was atrocious in the PDF specimens I produced using the web app version of Microsoft Word. As I suspected, the problem had something to do with the fact that I was using the web version of Microsoft Word. Friend of the show <a href=\"https://glennf.com/\">Glenn Fleishman</a> used the native Mac version of Word to produce new PDFs from my Word documents, and the kerning problems are gone. If you care, you can either go back and click through to each PDF in the original article, or <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/New%20Office%20Font%20Specimens.zip\">download this zip archive</a> of all 6 PDF specimens. (And of course Glenn, of all people, cared enough to lend a hand.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/22/update-office-pdfs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4cbbdc1dee4d51434767c85e37c1b0124440c2e0baa322a14f8c63c0d0d01e4d","category":"Tech"}
