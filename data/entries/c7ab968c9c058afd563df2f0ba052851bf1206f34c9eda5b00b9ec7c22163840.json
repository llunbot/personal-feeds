They said that Trochilus executed and ran only in memory, and the final payload never appeared on disks in most cases. That made the malware difficult to detect. Researchers from NHS Digital in the UK <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2019/cc-2929\">have said</a> Trochilus was developed by APT10, an advanced persistent threat group linked to the Chinese government that also goes by the names Stone Panda and MenuPass.</p>\n<p>Other groups eventually used it, and its source code has <a href=\"https://github.com/RamadhanAmizudin/malware/tree/62d0035db6bc9aa279b7c60250d439825ae65e41/Trochilus\">been available</a> on GitHub for more than six years. Trochilus has been seen being used in campaigns that used a separate piece of malware known as RedLeaves.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969201#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969201&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c7ab968c9c058afd563df2f0ba052851bf1206f34c9eda5b00b9ec7c22163840","category":"Tech"}
