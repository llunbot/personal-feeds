Remember when you saw Zoe Ball and her son on <em>Celebrity Gogglebox</em> and realised what a perfect blend of Norman Cook and Zoe Ball little Woody Cook was? Remember when weekly gear round up introductions weren’t so flipping tenuous?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea who <em>D4 damage</em> was – I assume it’s a person due to the ‘ill behaviour’ having been brought. But what I do know is I’ve had a lovely week in bikes, ride testing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/merida-silex-review\" target=\"_blank\">the new Merida Silex</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/matej-mohoric-gravel-worlds-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Matej Mohorič rode to UCI Gravel World Championships gold</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The World also saw the annual <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bespoked-2023-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Bespoked Handmade Bicycle Show 2023</a>, and Will went, it looked amazing and I’m jealous. Keep an eye on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist magazine</a> for upcoming features on specific bikes and builders. My penneth worth – I would kill for a titanium Sturdy or a steel Repete, two of the most beautiful custom bikes I’ve seen in years.

It’s also marginally lighter thanks to the sailcloth-cum-ripstop material, which also happens to be pretty waterproof (albeit not <em>technically</em> 100% waterproof). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to point out weight because Chrome bags do tend to be pretty chunky – this one weighs 1.3kg – but the payoff is incredible durability as that weight is in the hardy metal buckles, reinforced seams, ergonomic straps, zippers, foam padded back to reduce sweating, ergonomic padded straps… you get the idea. Chrome doesn’t mess around with making bags, nor does it offer lifetime guarantees for nothing. Which is good, because this ain’t cheap, but I’d hazard to say it’ll pay for itself in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-5-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bravo’s main compartment is one cavernous cavern, that perhaps one day some ingenious bag engineer might put a light in, but until then it holds an awful lot in the dark. But what’s nice – again in contrast to the Barrage – is the front compartment with ‘tech organiser’. That is, all manner of pockets for phones, pens, pads, powerbanks and penguins (the bars, some smaller birds may fit). In fact, anything beginning with p, plus a padded laptop sleeve for laptops up to 17”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-970x663.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-970x663.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-300x205.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-768x525.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-1536x1050.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-2048x1400.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-750x513.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-1140x779.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, my favourite feature, just like the Barrage, only pared down, is the cargo straps. Great for stashing a jacket or bike helmet or anything stinky you don’t want inside your backpack, such as gym gear or durian fruit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-970x656.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-970x656.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-300x203.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-768x519.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-1536x1039.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-2048x1385.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-750x507.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Chrome_Bravo_backpack-6-1140x771.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I said that was my favourite thing, but there is one more – the side pockets. Unlike so many boxy rolltop bags, they expand outwards, as opposed to sitting tight and flush against the sides with no give, thus making it impossible to put a bottle in the side when the bag is full. The Amber X colour is cool too, finally a bag to match my tan walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP £221</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.santafixie.co.uk%2Fchrome-industries-bravo-4-0-backpack-black-x.html\" target=\"_blank\">Santafixie (£191.70)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lezyne Micro Drive light set</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-970x707.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-970x707.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-300x219.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-768x560.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-1536x1120.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2048x1494.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-750x547.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-1140x831.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tis the season to get the lights out, so what better way to celebrate than Lezyne’s new Micro Drive light set – here it’s the Micro Drive 800+ front light paired with the Strip Drive 300+ rear light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you might have guessed from the numbers, that’s lumens and that means the Micro Drive set is really very bright, especially the rear light, as most rear lights tend not to surpass 100 lumens. That puts these lights firmly in the ‘see and be seen category’, ie I can illuminate an unlit road and ride safely using the front light on full power ‘Blast’ mode, and International Space Station can see my rear light.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Burn times are impressive given the lights’ sizes, which I’ll measure in that other industry metric, matchboxes. I’d put the rear light at a tad smaller than a matchbox, the front at two matchboxes. Basically, these are small, and hence very neat. The front will run full power for a claimed two hours, down to up to 35 hours in power saving ‘femto’ mode – running at 20 lumens and flashing. Similarly, the rear will at 5 lumens for up to a staggering 80 hours, or will ‘day flash’ at 300 lumens for 17 hours. That’s another great feature and the reason for the very high-powered rear light – the Micro Drive 300+ is a great safety light for daytime running.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-970x643.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-2048x1357.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-750x497.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-1140x755.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mounting is via replaceable bungees, with the rear being supplied with an extra chock so it can seat on D-shaped posts. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Lezyne_Micro_Drive_lights-5-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Charging is performed via USB-C, though my one gripe is a cable isn’t supplied.

It. Looked. Sick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I got into road bikes at a time when road bikes had coloured tyres. It was fun, I had some red ones; everyone said coloured road bike tyres had less grip due to altering the compound in the name of fashion. So I went back to black. But now…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t help but love these Panaracer tyres, because look at their colours! How I am going to run a mismatched colour combo too. Also, these are GravelKings, which in my experience happen to be a brilliant family of gravel tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Panaracer_GravelKing_tyres-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The GravelKings are tubeless, obvs, 120tpi, which is about as supple as such tyres come, and in this guise are semi slick. That means the tread has a close-packed centre to roll like a slick road tyre on road and wider spaced outer nobbies for dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve gone for some 700c×32mm (claimed 330g), as I can see this tread will be perfect less for gravel and more for winter riding, when wider, treaded tyres for my road bike are just the ticket on muddy, leaf strewn lanes. If wider is your bag, though, Panaracer also do 38mm (410g) and 43mm (claimed 480g) versions</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP £49.99</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MdNb31\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon (£49.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spoke Winter Travel cycling jeans</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-970x639.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-970x639.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-300x198.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-768x506.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-2048x1349.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-750x494.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-3-1140x751.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret to Spoke’s stretchy jeans is the elastane content woven into the denim. It’s just 6% in total – elastane plus elastomultiester, the sorts of materials found in bibshorts – while the rest is a mix of cotton and recycled cotton. But yet these Spoke Winter Travel jeans have a feel not unlike wearing very weighty lycra. It’s kind of mad, in that they don’t feel like they’re going to stretch as well as they do through the movement of each pedal stroke, yet somehow the fabric flexes and stretches without inhibiting movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-970x632.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-970x632.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-300x195.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-768x500.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-2048x1335.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-750x489.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1-1140x743.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In broad strokes the Winter Travel jeans are as you’d expect of a jean, save for a natty little internal zip up pocket inside the back pocket, designed for stashing things like a passport or thin card wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Spoke_jeans-5-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the stretch, the Winter Travel jeans have a hugging feel and a tight look (I can neither confirm nor deny that is a picture of my bum), which isn’t going to be for everyone, and my juries still out on that one (even if my partner has firmly stated her feelings).

The lightest is 10oz, the heaviest 14oz, such that these are more on the thicker side of things, hence their ‘winter’ moniker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with material fit suitable for cycling and commuting, Spoke’s other big USP is its sizes. These jeans come in an incredible 297 sizes, if you took every permutation of the 11 waists, three builds and nine leg lengths available. There are also several colours to choose from, and if this cut isn’t quite right for you, check out Spoke’s myriad other jeans and trousers.

Four solid hours over four bingeable Netflix episodes documenting the rise then fall, then rise and rise – then a bit more of a fall – then rise again of David Beckham. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this has nothing to do with cycling, but <em>Beckham </em>is fascinating viewing for any fan of humanity or the Spice Girls. It is the role of sport in the modern world, it is the cult of celebrity, capitalistic largesse, it is family, marriage, vicarious fathers, the disgrace of our media; it is politics, it is haircuts. It had me riveted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly because I was a huge United fan as a kid*, mainly because David Beckham is just an incredible individual. Sportsman, artist, Peter Pan, savant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At face value, this is a story of a bloke that got really good at football, but settle in and <em>Beckham</em> is so much more, a cultural time capsule of late-90s-2000s Britain that holds a mirror up to what a horrible, scandalising, deifying-then-vilifying, fickle lot we can all be.
