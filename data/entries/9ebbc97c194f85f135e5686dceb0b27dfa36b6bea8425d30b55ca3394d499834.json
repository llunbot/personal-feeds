It's not clear if the panel size relates to a specific product or a panel production process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been known to be working on foldable display technology for some years now, filing multiple patents regarding the technology. Rumors in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/\">September 2020</a> indicated that Samsung was providing foldable display samples to Apple for a future foldable ‌iPhone‌, but there had been no strong indication that Apple was planning to use Samsung's technology until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2021, <em>Bloomberg</em> claimed that Apple had started \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/\">early work</a>\" on an ‌iPhone‌ with a foldable display, but that it had not committed to releasing a foldable device at that time. Development in 2021 had not expanded beyond a display, and Apple did not have full foldable ‌iPhone‌ prototypes. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo initially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphones-with-under-screen-touch-id-now-coming-in-2023-foldable-iphone-in-2024/\">said</a> that Apple would introduce a foldable ‌iPhone‌ in 2024, but in 2022, he revised his prediction and said that Apple is unlikely to unveil a foldable iPhone until <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/\">2025 or later</a>. Display analyst Ross Young has also suggested <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-exploring-20-inch-foldable-macbook/\">2025</a> is the earliest that we might see a foldable ‌iPhone‌.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/\">Samsung Display Readies Development Team for Apple Foldable Panels</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-display-readies-development-team-for-apple-foldable-panels.2413363/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ebbc97c194f85f135e5686dceb0b27dfa36b6bea8425d30b55ca3394d499834","category":"Apple"}
