The Optiq will slot in below the larger <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/\">Lyriq</a>, Celestiq, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/cadillac-reveals-the-2025-escalade-iq-one-excessive-ev/\">Escalade IQ</a> SUVs but is still based on GM's steadily proliferating Ultium electric vehicle architecture.</p>\n<p>Having driven no fewer than five different Ultium-based vehicles in the past year, I visited the Optiq preview, hoping to learn how Cadillac can differentiate this compact crossover from other offerings in an increasingly competitive segment. I also wanted to see whether GM has effectively made the case for EV converts who are looking at entry-level options versus a lower price point for the similarly specced Chevrolet Equinox EV.</p>\n<p>In person, the Optiq's exterior styling continues the language established by Lyriq and Celestiq, if toned down to a slightly less-aggressive futuristic level. Straked patterns on the angular, faded quarter panels make for a nice touch, though the details looked two-dimensional, as if they were stickers, until I got up close enough to inspect the use of real glass layering.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027188#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027188&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db69f32a8005bede1a79c73c74bf5f18d3259002a4ccb0f3416a624a6858700b","category":"Tech"}
