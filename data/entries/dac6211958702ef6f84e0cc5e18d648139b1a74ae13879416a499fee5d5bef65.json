{"title":"iPad Air Now the Only iPad in Apple's Lineup That Lacks 12MP Ultra Wide Front Camera With Center Stage","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/ipad-air-only-ipad-lacks-12mp-front-camera/","date":1631700644000,"content":"Yesterday during Apple's virtual \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/apple-september-2021-event-recap/\">California streaming</a>\" event, Apple debuted a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/apple-announces-new-9th-gen-ipad-with-a13-chip-true-tone-display-and-more/\">ninth-generation entry-level iPad</a> ($329) and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/ipad-mini-redesign-usb-c-announced/\">redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini</a> ($499). Like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, both devices include a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera enabling Center Stage, which makes the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> ($579) the only tablet in Apple's lineup that lacks this feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/ipad-air-arrive-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCenter Stage is a feature that automatically keeps users perfectly framed during video calls, and it does this by using the much larger field of view of the Ultra Wide front camera. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When other people join in on the call, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple debuted the feature in April with the latest ‌iPad Pro‌. At the time, it was thought the machine learning capabilities of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip were required to power the feature, but given that the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> use A13 and A15 Bionic chips, respectively, that's patently not the case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe current ‌iPad Air‌, which debuted in September 2020, has an A14 Bionic processor, but only a f/2.0, 7-megapixel front-facing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> HD Camera for selfies and video calls, making it incompatible with Center Stage. The ‌iPad Air‌ is in its mid-product cycle, however, so it's likely to get the 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera in a refresh, perhaps early next year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2021-event/\">September 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/ipad-air-only-ipad-lacks-12mp-front-camera/\">iPad Air Now the Only iPad in Apple's Lineup That Lacks 12MP Ultra Wide Front Camera With Center Stage</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-now-the-only-ipad-in-apples-lineup-that-lacks-12mp-ultra-wide-front-camera-with-center-stage.2310996/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y8LUyxx_YE0:0OV0rIo-zoM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y8LUyxx_YE0:0OV0rIo-zoM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Y8LUyxx_YE0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dac6211958702ef6f84e0cc5e18d648139b1a74ae13879416a499fee5d5bef65","category":"Apple"}
