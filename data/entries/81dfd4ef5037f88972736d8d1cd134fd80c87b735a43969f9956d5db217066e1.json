One trend that has gained popularity over the last several years is personality quizzes based on so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguous_image\">ambiguous images</a>—in which one sees either <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/optical-illusion-reveals-secrets-about-your-personality/YHW4UB34J7VVCTHGFA3CC6KICA/\">a young girl</a> or an old man, for instance, or <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/what-you-see-in-this-optical-illusion-reveals-a-lot-about-your-personality/UICHHDYRLRA3VLUBWWA6YCLAC4/\">a skull</a> or a little girl.
