Reliable. Capable. You could apply those words to the best gear for a number of different purposes, but in this case, that is the basis of Le Colâ€™s new ARC Collection. As their first-ever gravel collection, Le Col states that ARC is a bold new direction for the brand. Instead of high-end road kit, ARC is still high-end, but more focused on exploring unknown roads, gravel, and dirt tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARC_Overview.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1076\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARC_Overview-1536x1076.png\" alt=\"Le Col Gravel cycling clothing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARC_Overview-1536x1076.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARC_Overview-297x208.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARC_Overview-120x84.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARC_Overview-768x538.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ARC_Overview-2048x1435.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your style, the ARC range has a little bit for everyone.

A premium chamois is included with a bamboo blend microfiber top sheet for durable comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-Gravel-cycling-clothing-collection-pieces1.png\"><img width=\"808\" height=\"916\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-Gravel-cycling-clothing-collection-pieces1.png\" alt=\"Le Col Gravel cycling clothing overshoot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-Gravel-cycling-clothing-collection-pieces1.png 808w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-Gravel-cycling-clothing-collection-pieces1-265x300.png 265w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-Gravel-cycling-clothing-collection-pieces1-106x120.png 106w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-Gravel-cycling-clothing-collection-pieces1-768x871.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ARC Overshort ($145) gives riders a more casual look, but still offers a trim fit with 4-way stretch material for easy pedaling.

But even if you didnâ€™t know the price, you would still think itâ€™s premium by the feel. Everything from the grippers, to the strap material, to the chamois, feels luxurious. If youâ€™re paying a lot for your kit, this is how you want it to feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a chance to check out the Cargo Bib Shorts and the Merino Long Sleeve Jersey ahead of time, and overall I wasnâ€™t disappointed. Surprised really. The last Le Col kit I tried didnâ€™t blow me away, but the ARC collection is on another level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fit, previously, I was a solid medium in Le Col. I have lost some weight recently, but the ARC collection feels more relaxed in the fit making the medium a bit loose in spots for me. Iâ€™m often in between a small and a medium, and if I ordered again, I would keep the medium jersey but order a small pair of shorts. Otherwise, the cut is excellent with the Merino wool jersey fitting tight on or off the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iâ€™ve been riding the kit in ideal fall conditions from 40-70ÂºF, and with the right base layer (or none at all) the temperature regulation has been perfect. I love Merino wool and its ability to keep you warm without feeling too hot when the temperature rises, and thatâ€™s no different here. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Le Col Gravel cycling clothing rear pocket detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-2-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Le Col Gravel cycling clothing cargo pocket detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Le-Col-ARC-gravel-cycling-clothing-pocket-detail-1-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only temperature-related asterisk comes from the rear pockets of the bibs. Because it has two layers of the outer short material the pockets are likely very durable, but theyâ€™re also warmer than a bib with only one layer of fabric on the small of your back. Itâ€™s a small complaint, especially since the pockets are very well executed. The positioning makes them easily accessible, without feeling the contents when youâ€™re pedaling â€“Â even with a bulky cell phone in a case inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Itâ€™s the same story with the cargo pockets on the legs. If you like the mesh outer layer found on other brandsâ€™ cargo bibs, you wonâ€™t find that here. The reason is that Le Col specifically wanted to make sure the pockets stayed in place with zero bounce or sag when loaded. Through their testing with multiple materials including mesh, they found that using the same fabric as the shorts resulted in a more durable and supportive pocket than a mesh outer. The result is a pocket system that can be loaded with the heaviest items without any sagging or bouncing over rough terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might be Le Colâ€™s first-ever gravel line, but for me, itâ€™s my favorite Le Col kit yet. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/le-col-gravel-arc-clothing-range-review/\">Le Col Dives Deep Into Gravel with New Premium ARC Clothing Range</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9a8f1f9980c3388d33bc5dab6031bf8b83780fedb9647d181287cdc419f0be55","category":"Cycling"}
