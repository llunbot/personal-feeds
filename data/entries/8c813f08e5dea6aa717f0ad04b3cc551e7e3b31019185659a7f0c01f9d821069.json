Updates to a beloved gadget can leave us outraged, whether it's because we're <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/sonos-ousts-executive-blamed-for-rushing-botched-app-update/\">frustrated with bugs</a> or we're Luddites and tech enthusiasts averse to change.</p>\n<p>In addition to those frustrations, there are times when gadget makers use software updates to manipulate product functionality and seriously upend owners' abilities to use their property as expected. We’ve all seen software updates render gadgets absolutely horrible: Printers have nearly become a four-letter word as the industry infamously issues updates that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-ceo-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-fights-viruses/\">brick third-party ink</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/\">scanning capabilities</a>. We've also seen company updates that locked features<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/1700-smart-bassinet-adds-20-month-sub-but-only-if-you-buy-it-used/\"> behind a paywall</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/oral-b-bricks-ability-to-set-up-alexa-on-230-smart-toothbrush/\">removed them entirely</a>. This type of behavior has caused users to be wary of software updates in fear that they will diminish the value of already-purchased hardware.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are times when software updates <i>enrich </i>the capabilities of smart gadgets. These updates are the types of things that can help devices retain or improve their value, last longer, and become less likely to turn into e-waste.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/when-software-updates-actually-improve-instead-of-ruin-our-favorite-devices/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/when-software-updates-actually-improve-instead-of-ruin-our-favorite-devices/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c813f08e5dea6aa717f0ad04b3cc551e7e3b31019185659a7f0c01f9d821069","category":"Tech"}
