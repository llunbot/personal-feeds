After holding to hover at 500 meters and then 50 meters altitude, SLIM pulsed its engines to fine-tune its vertical descent before touching down at 10:20 am EST (15:20 UTC).</p>\n<p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which manages the SLIM mission, streamed the landing live on YouTube. About two hours after the touchdown, JAXA officials held a press conference to confirm the spacecraft made a successful landing, apparently quite close to its target. SLIM aimed to settle onto the lunar surface adjacentÂ to a nearly 900-foot (270-meter) crater named Shioli, located in a region called the Sea of Nectar on the near side of the Moon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997302#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997302&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f2febb06019d3c87cfeaa4610d6e3fdc0d8e6e94d5c0a0eba302491fcb73a507","category":"Tech"}
