Researchers led by University of Cincinnati biologist Joshua Benoit have now discovered that flies that have had enough of the mites will stay awake at the expense of their health.</p>\n<p>These mite-resistant flies drain their nutrient reserves to stay up all night, making them more susceptible to starvation.
