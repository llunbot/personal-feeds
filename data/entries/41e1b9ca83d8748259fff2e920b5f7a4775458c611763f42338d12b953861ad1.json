Fast forward to today and Savage is leading a team of six riders granted a wildcard invitation for what the UCI has labelled the biggest World Championships ever, with more than 200 rainbow jerseys up for grabs over the next 10 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My wife and I go to Cape Verde every couple of years,’ says Savage. ‘In May last year, we went and saw a lot of kids not in school. We figured out that there were very few bikes, and the minibuses that would take the kids to school often couldn’t afford to run because of fuel prices.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of simply getting back to thumbing through his holiday reading on the beach, Savage, who runs his own cycling and triathlon training company, was compelled to do something about what he saw. He contacted the Cape Verde Cycling Federation – or Federação Cabo-verdiana de Ciclismo – offering help in the form of a fundraiser that bought bicycles to be distributed as the federation saw fit. As a thank you for his efforts, the FCC invited him back to race at their nationals last December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more than 30 riders started Cape Verde’s 75km national road race or the 16km time-trial. But Savage was among them. ‘I was buzzing,’ he says. ‘But I wasn’t really there to race – I was just there as a guest… which is where I met these boys and saw that here were these beautiful, raw diamonds.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diamonds in the rough of 10 volcanic islands (nine of them inhabited) with a population of just over 500,000 people. Diamonds who are not part of a system beyond their local club or bike shop, and who are either still studying or recently left their education, or who balance their training with regular day jobs. Many of them have never stepped foot out of Cape Verde – until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cape Verde cycling team\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1349_Dave-posed-by-the-pier.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Dave Savage has high hopes for the Cape Verde team. </figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson / Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There was so much talent that wasn’t nurtured, wasn’t guided,’ says Savage. ‘The ambitions of the riders are very high. With a bit of fine-tuning, these boys can be incredibly good. I can’t say they’ll make GC in a Grand Tour within a certain time. But just to give them the opportunity to try [is the important thing].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Genetically, I swear there is something about these boys that is so conducive to cycling… And the lack of vices [helps]. None of them drink alcohol. There is no Burger King. There’s not much in the way of employment, so they have time on their hands.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-worlds-what-to-watch\">Glasgow World Champs: 9 weird and wonderful events you need to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Glasgow UCI Cycling World Championships 2023: Key information</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Again, Savage couldn’t ignore the drive to do something with what was in front of him: ‘I offered to coach them.

With <em>Cyclist</em> invited along for the ride, we’re heading over the Solent for a training ride and photoshoot for Le Col, one of a few brands to step up and sponsor the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There’s a lot of correspondence before you get to this point,’ says Savage. ‘I reached out to various potential sponsors. For every positive response you have, there are probably 30 who say no. So I’m incredibly grateful to Le Col, Giant, Abus, Cadex, Wightlink and everybody involved in helping us climb a hurdle and move to the next one.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cape Verde cycling team\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_3857_Disembark-from-ferry_.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Matt Grayson / Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The team are riding bikes they picked up only a couple of days prior, from the Giant store in Southampton. Savage chose Hampshire as a base so they could acclimatise to relatively quiet European roads ahead of their debut on the world stage. When they travel north to Scotland for the 2023 World Championships, all six riders will take part in the Gran Fondo, an amateur event with rainbow bands at stake for age group winners in a race around the glens and lochs of Perth, on 4th August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cape Verde was among the countries invited as part of the UCI’s efforts to encourage all cycling federations to participate in the first Worlds to integrate all cycling disciplines, with the aim of making ‘cycling the sport of the 21st century, to make it more inclusive’ as part of its 2030 Agenda. As well as the Gran Fondo, the three youngest members of the squad will also ride the Under-23 Time-Trial, with the other three taking part in the senior time-trial – all on road bikes, because they couldn’t get hold of TT ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Everywhere we look, we’ve faced obstacles and barriers like funding, the lack of UCI-legal bikes – and having no way of getting the money for them without pulling in a couple of favours,’ says Savage, who knows a thing or two about competing at a major event after racing the triathlon final at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, representing his birth nation of Kiribati in the central Pacific. ‘But where there’s a will, there’s a way. And we’ll just chalk those hurdles off, one at a time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what they are riding, Savage’s stable see the Worlds as a huge opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cape Verde cycling team\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_1032_Nelio-posed-by-the-pier.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Nelio Patrick de Cruz is a national champion. </figcaption><figcaption>Matt Grayson / Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nelio Patrick de Cruz – or the ‘Cruz Missile’, as Savage calls him – is 22, from the island of St Vincent. Having not long finished his studies, he’s the Cape Verde national road race and TT champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Expectations for Glasgow are not that big,’ says Cruz. ‘I want to finish the race and get a good result.

But Savage says far less credit is due to the Cape Verde Cycling Federation (FCC) – though they are happy to take it where they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They love making out that they’re doing everything for everyone,’ says Savage. ‘They’re trimming all my reports to make it sound like they’re doing it.

[But] this is their story, not mine.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cape Verde cycling team\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/MG_Le-Col_Cape-Verde_0647_Dave-showing-the-boys-route-on-his-phone.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Matt Grayson / Le Col</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Savage’s goals for his team are clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘What I want to do with these boys is open their minds and seize an opportunity that might never come around again.
