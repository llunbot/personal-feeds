In addition to Ticketmaster, the banking firm <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6ppv06e3n8o\">Santander</a> has also acknowledged that their data was stolen but declined to identify the account from which it was stolen. Wired, however, has independently confirmed that it was a Snowflake account; the stolen data included bank account details for 30 million customers, including 6 million account numbers and balances, 28 million credit card numbers, and human resources information about staff, according to a post published by the hackers. Lending Tree and Advance Auto Parts have also said they might be victims as well.</p>\n<p>Snowflake has not revealed details about how the hackers accessed the accounts, saying only that the intruders did not directly breach Snowflake’s network. This week, Google-owned security firm Mandiant, one of the companies engaged by Snowflake to investigate the breaches, revealed in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion\">a blog post</a> that in some cases the hackers first obtained access through third-party contractors, without identifying the contractors or stating how this access aided the hackers in breaching the Snowflake accounts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032105#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032105&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b03130ab453755416a0acfd233185f24d212784a2a1d1724094c744a16965a0a","category":"Tech"}
