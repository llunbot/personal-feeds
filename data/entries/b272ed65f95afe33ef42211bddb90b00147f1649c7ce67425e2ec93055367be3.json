Problems with software testing on the Psyche spacecraft prompted NASA managers to delay the launch by more than a year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/nasa-says-its-metal-mission-psyche-is-back-on-track-for-an-october-liftoff/\">An independent review board</a> set up to analyze the reasons for the Psyche launch delay identified issues with the spacecraft’s software and weaknesses in the plan to test the software before Psyche’s launch. Digging deeper, the review panel determined that NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the Psyche mission, was encumbered by staffing and workforce problems exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953108#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953108&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b272ed65f95afe33ef42211bddb90b00147f1649c7ce67425e2ec93055367be3","category":"Tech"}
