Yes, they’ve all worn the yellow jersey and won Grand Tour stages, but more importantly – at least for the purposes of this piece – they’re all Olympic Road Race champions. It’s a strange sort of accolade, because while in most sports an Olympic gold medal would be the peak of achievement, in cycling it’s met by fans with little more than a shrug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All too often an Olympic Road Race course is a dull procession designed to show off tourist sites rather than promote exciting racing, and the standard of an Olympic peloton is usually so low that the outcome can (allegedly and wholly indemonstrably) be decided by a simple chat, handshake and promise of a bottle of vino on the way to The Mall.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tokyo-olympics-cycling-moments\">Five of the best cycling moments from the Tokyo Olympics</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-cyclists-at-paris-2024-olympics\">Who are the British cyclists competing at the Paris 2024 Olympics?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/josh-tarling-interview\">‘Everything leads towards the Olympics’: Josh Tarling Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Just look at the women’s road race in Tokyo 2021, when nobody – not least Annemiek van Vleuten – seemed to appreciate that there was still one plucky escapee up the road. Take nothing away from Austria’s Anna Kiesenhofer, a worthy champion who had the guts to attack early and the strength to hold on, but the whole event reeked of the amateurism for which the Games were once fabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that could all change this summer with a route that not only mirrors a Flemish Classic, but one that simultaneously scratches an itch while showcasing the scope Paris has to offer for bike races beyond its usual playground of the Champs-Élysées.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-970x686.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Carapaz\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-970x686.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-300x212.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-768x543.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-1536x1086.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-2048x1448.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-750x530.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/olympics-2021-carapaz-1140x806.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Richard Carapaz of Team Ecuador celebrates winning the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021</figcaption><figcaption>Michael Steele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Starting in the plush Trocadéro neighbourhood, the men’s race is 273km long and takes in ten climbs in a winding loop southwest of the French capital, including one segment that crams six ascents into 40km. But it’s the final hour of racing where things get spicy, with three loops of a city circuit in the famous hilltop district of Montmartre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the 1940s, cyclocross races were held annually in this rundown artists’ enclave in northern Paris, where the likes of Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, Degas and other Belle Époque giants lived and worked a brush stroke away from the red light district of Pigalle. Scores of riders – including 1947 Tour de France champion Jean Robic – would run up the 280 steps alongside the funicular to the basilica of Sacré-Coeur before freewheeling down some of the narrow, twisting roads and past the famous Moulin Rouge via other various off-road challenges. I highly recommend seeking out videos of these races on YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"633\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-970x633.jpg\" alt=\"anna kiesenhofer tokyo 2020 gold medal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-970x633.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-300x196.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-768x501.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-1536x1002.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-2048x1336.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-750x489.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-1140x743.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Granted, the Olympic course isn’t quite as gnarly, but on three occasions the riders – both men and women – will tackle the kilometre-long drag up the partially cobbled Rue Lepic with its Les Deux Moulins cafe (of <em>Amélie</em> fame) and then sweep past the basilica towards two more punchy ramps to the east of the Canal Saint-Martin and back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that part is a gritty circuit that takes the riders off the well-trodden tourist track, then the third ascent of the ‘Côte d’Amélie’ is followed by a fast and technical drop back through the traditional heart of Paris, past the Opéra and Louvre, before a flat run along the Seine ahead of a finish in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. It’s bold, it’s brave – and it could be won by some of the best riders in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>World Champion Mathieu van der Poel, his big rival Wout van Aert and Grand Tour winners Remco Evenepoel are said to be going for gold – along with punchy specialists such as Mads Pedersen, Michael Matthews, Michael Woods, Jhonatan Narváez and Britain’s own Tom Pidcock.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In the women’s 158km race, the deadly Dutch trio of Demi Vollering, Marianne Vos and Lorena Wiebes will come up against Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky and Italy’s Elisa Longo Borghini – to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are, for the most part, riders at the peak of their powers, not in search of a retirement plan or the novelty of riding a gold bike for four years. We should be in for a treat that outdoes even the best of Parisian patisseries. Just as the Nice finale at this year’s Tour shows there can be a future for finishes outside Paris, the use of the Butte Montmartre at the Olympics may give ASO ideas beyond the Champs-Élysées. This gruelling attritional race will be the antithesis of the usual Paris procession that caps the Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally we’ll have an Olympics worth watching, one that delivers and ups the ante ahead of Los Angeles 2028, which will have no option now but to head up into the Hollywood Hills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 155 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tokyo-olympics-cycling-moments\">Five of the best cycling moments from the Tokyo Olympics</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-cyclists-at-paris-2024-olympics\">Who are the British cyclists competing at the Paris 2024 Olympics?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/josh-tarling-interview\">‘Everything leads towards the Olympics’: Josh Tarling Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/olympic-games-2024-road-race-opinion\">Opinion: This Olympic Road Race might actually be worth watching</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3574eb33e302ad4d7c6b3acb74e7460116a51ea724ca4f87df9e25de931a1675","category":"Cycling"}
