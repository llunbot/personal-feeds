Mice have a higher brain-to-body mass ratio, and long-finned pilot whales have more neurons. So what makes humans—and more specifically, human brains—special?</p>\n<p>As far as organs go, human brains certainly consume a ton of energy—almost 50 grams of sugar, or 12 lumps, every day. This is one of the highest energy demands relative to body metabolism known among species. But what uses up all of this energy? If the human brain is the predicted size and has the predicted number of neurons for a primate of its size, and each individual neuron uses comparable amounts of energy to those in other mammals, then its energy use shouldn’t be exceptional.</p>\n<h2>The cost of signaling</h2>\n<p>A group of neuroscientists speculated that maybe the amount of signaling that takes place within the human brain accounts for its heightened energy needs. A consequence of this would be that brain regions that are more highly connected and do more signaling will use more energy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991952#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991952&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Diana Gitig","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98f8849479ec6625f61ba1ee32f7e0f4e358783f5e7a9a27fbd6cc9cc119b96d","category":"Tech"}
