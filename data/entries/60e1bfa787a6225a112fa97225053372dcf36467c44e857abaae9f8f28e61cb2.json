Some of us have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/03/suddenly-working-at-home-weve-done-it-for-22-years-and-have-advice/\" target=\"_blank\">been living the telecommuting life for longer</a> than others, and while we at Ars have some extensive experience (and an equally comprehensive guide on the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\">best gear for home offices</a>), we still like to periodically change things up to meet our dynamic needs. That's how I found the Desk Bike.</p>\n<p>Well, that, and I'm recovering from a foot injury that recently got me into biking as a mode of low-impact exercise. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38B24rY\" target=\"_blank\">Flexispot's V9 Desk Bike</a> now sits in my room and gets consistent use. You (or your kids) might have seen this very bike <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@treyfoundjules/video/6884350493737405701?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vogue.com%2Farticle%2Ftiktok-made-me-buy-it-hybrid-bike-desk&amp;referer_video_id=6884350493737405701&amp;refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\">make waves on TikTok</a> recently—Flexispot's ad campaign proved a savvy and fruitful move, garnering over 2.5 million likes and coverage from many media outlets.</p>\n<p>It's well-known that exercise, even in the form of a 30-minute daily walk, produces a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">wide range of positive impacts</a> on <a href=\"https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf#page=56\" target=\"_blank\">physical and mental health</a>. But as of 2018, <a href=\"https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">80% of American adults</a> don't meet that daily threshold. It can be hard to peel ourselves away from the computer and actually move our bodies, but not doing so is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm\" target=\"_blank\">literally killing us</a>. The Desk Bike isn't a magic bullet for healthy living, but it can help you be more active and get out pent-up, fidgety energy during the day.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788054#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788054&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60e1bfa787a6225a112fa97225053372dcf36467c44e857abaae9f8f28e61cb2","category":"Tech"}
