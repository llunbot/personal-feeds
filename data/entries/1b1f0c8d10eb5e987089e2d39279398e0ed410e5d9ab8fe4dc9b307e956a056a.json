Back then, when we had to do something like install Mac OS, we used a thingamajig called an <em>optical disc</em>, which had the software on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, as <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/classicii_mrmac/status/1724458867696795856&amp;xcust=1-1-2137964-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">ClassicII_MrMac</a> on X (formerly Twitter) put it perfectly, “Today is a sad day.” That’s because Apple no longer sells the optical disc installers for OS X Lion 10.7 and Mountain Lion 10.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Today is a sad day…<br /><br />You can no longer buy OS X Mountain Lion from the Apple online store.ðŸ˜‚ <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/Pxa6pHrU9t&amp;xcust=1-1-2137964-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/Pxa6pHrU9t</a></p>— Mr. Macintosh (@ClassicII_MrMac) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/ClassicII_MrMac/status/1724458867696795856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2137964-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">November 14, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple either finally sold out its stock or decided to dump the discs to make warehouse space for FineWoven iPhone cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>The signs were there that this was going to happen–you can’t stop the future from coming. Two years ago, Apple started to offer Lion and Mountain Lion as free downloads. They’re available on Apple’s support site, and if you need ’em, here are the links:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2077&amp;xcust=1-1-350041-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/350041/apple-goes-retro-with-free-downloads-of-os-x-lion-and-mountain-lion.html\">Mac OS X Lion installer free download</a> (4.72GB)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2076&amp;xcust=1-1-350041-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/350041/apple-goes-retro-with-free-downloads-of-os-x-lion-and-mountain-lion.html\">Mac OS X Mountain Lion installer free download</a> (4.45GB)</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350041/apple-goes-retro-with-free-downloads-of-os-x-lion-and-mountain-lion.html\">I wrote that it was strange</a> that Apple still offered the Lion and Mountain Lions discs for $19.99. The older me now thinks it wasn’t so strange because lots of older Macs are still in use–plus, it’s an easy $20 for Apple to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>If you need to put those installers on a disc or USB drive, we have instructions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/213279/make-a-bootable-lion-installer.html\">How to make a bootable Lion install disc or drive</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/218583/how-to-make-a-bootable-mountain-lion-install-drive.html\">How to make a bootable Mountain Lion install drive</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671911/how-to-get-old-macos-download-big-sur-catalina-mojave-and-more.html\">How to get an older version of macOS or Mac OS X</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lion runs on Macs that came before Mountain Lion in 2012.

And if you have one, here’s some advice from this old timer: You might want to hold on to it for a while. Chances are, years from now, someone will be willing to pay <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1357446/original-iphone-sealed-auction-sold.html\">big bucks for it at an auction</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option, find out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672461/how-to-install-macos-on-unsupported-mac.html\">how to run new versions of macOS on unsupported Macs</a>. </p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1b1f0c8d10eb5e987089e2d39279398e0ed410e5d9ab8fe4dc9b307e956a056a","category":"Apple"}
