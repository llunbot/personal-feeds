The new MacBook Pros include the same display technology as the high-end 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, and can run at 24Hz rather than 10Hz. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌, Apple says that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> will automatically adapt the refresh rate depending on what a user is doing to save battery life.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>ProMotion technology also comes to the Mac on this new display, featuring an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz. ProMotion automatically varies the refresh rate to match the motion of a user's onscreen content to help preserve battery life, and makes tasks more fluid and even more responsive. Video editors can also lock in a refresh rate that is optimal for their footage. The combination of the outstanding XDR performance and super-fluid ProMotion technology make this the world's best notebook display.</blockquote>The new MacBook Pros are powered by either the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Pro or ‌‌M1‌‌ Max chip, both featuring significantly more performance compared to the ‌M1‌ chip, announced last year.
