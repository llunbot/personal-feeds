Both types have their benefits, but picking the right type is important because different styles work better in different situations.</p>\n<h3>Which mountain bike shoes are best for you?</h3>\n<p>There’s no right or wrong answer but it’s well worth considering what type of riding you’ll mostly be doing – XC (cross-country), trails or gravity orientated – because this will influence your decision.</p>\n<p>Flat-pedal shoes tend to be orientated towards trail, enduro and downhill riders, where feel and grip on the pedals, as well as protection, are important. Some flat-pedal shoes have soles that are stiffer than others, but none are as stiff as a dedicated cross-country shoe.</p>\n<p>Clipless-pedal shoes come in a wider variety of forms, catering to virtually every sort of rider. They range from XC shoes, which are much like road shoes but with a little bit of tread on the soles, all the way to DH shoes that resemble their flat-pedal counterparts, save for cleat mounts.</p>\n<p>So, what do you need to look out for?</p>\n<h3>Fit</h3>\n<p>No matter what style of shoe you choose, if they don’t fit correctly they’ll be uncomfortable and won’t perform as well as they should.</p>\n<p>We recommend you try before you buy because everyone’s feet are different and manufacturers use different lasts to build their shoes.</p>\n<p>Ensure there’s enough wiggle room for your toes and a decent hold on your heel for comfort and power transfer.</p>\n<p>You should also make sure there are no hot spots or parts that dig in because these will become painful on longer days in the saddle.</p>\n<h3>Retention system</h3>\n<p>The retention system is what keeps the shoes on your feet. Laces are the traditional option, but there are alternatives.</p>\n<p>Laces give you great control over a shoe’s feel and fit but can’t be adjusted on-the-fly and can get claggy with mud – unless they’re protected by a lace flap.</p>\n<p>Boa systems use a ratchet dial and a wire that’s looped through the shoe’s opening for quick, easy and accurate closure and adjustment. They’re found on pricier shoes and tend to be specced to help save weight.</p>\n<p>Velcro straps and ratchet buckles are more common and pretty rugged but weigh a bit more. They tend to come on cheaper and mid-price shoes.</p>\n<h3>Sole</h3>\n<p>The sole is key in defining how the shoe performs. XC riders will want a stiff sole that transfers every watt of power to the pedals. A stiff sole also helps when the shoe is perched on a small clipless pedal.</p>\n<p>Pricier shoes will benefit from a light and stiff carbon sole, while cheaper ones use plastic, which is heavier and more flexible.</p>\n<p>Trail and enduro riders tend to go one of two ways: either an XC-style shoe with more protection and a more aggressive tread or a gravity-orientated shoe with a more flexible, comfortable sole and a construction that performs better with clipless pedals that have a platform.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, weight and sole stiffness are of no concern to gravity-orientated riders, so they tend to go for shoes that offer plenty of pedal feel and foot protection.</p>\n<p>Tread pattern is also important. Some shoes offer a lightweight minimal tread, which is great for racing but will come up short if you need to run or walk anywhere while out on the trail. Others offer more grip and protection but weigh a little more as a result.</p>","author":"James McKnight","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a9df81ac0c677b540c25b4709042b51965a7b1d2f370a7a6407501df556cc34b","category":"Cycling"}
