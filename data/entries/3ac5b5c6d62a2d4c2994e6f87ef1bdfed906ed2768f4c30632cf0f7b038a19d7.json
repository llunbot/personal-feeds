{"title":"Trump Cuts Most Tariffs to 10% but Increases Tariffs on China to 125%","link":"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114309144289505174","date":1744224968000,"content":"\n<p>President Trump, in a post on Truth Social, which is apparently how the world’s financial markets now run:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s\nMarkets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the\nUnited States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some\npoint, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the\ndays of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer\nsustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that\nmore than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United\nStates, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the\nUSTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed\nrelative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation,\nand Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my\nstrong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against\nthe United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a\nsubstantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of\n10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to\nthis matter!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/09/trump-announces-90-day-tariff-pause-for-at-least-some-countries.html\">The entire stock market jumped</a> on Trump’s announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 up 8% as I type this. Apple is up 9%, Meta 13%, Nvidia 16%, and Tesla 19%. I’m not sure why though. All Trump seems to have done is switch from waging a trade war against the entire world to a trade war against China. And the 10% tariffs Trump now claims we’re applying to imports from the rest of world are themselves economic nonsense — they only look low compared to <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two\">the nonsensical rates Trump announced a week ago</a>. We’re at the whims of a mad king. Trying to report this as having any sort of logic in a traditional economic sense is folly. It’s like trying to make scientific sense out of the biblical fable of Noah’s Ark.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/trump-cuts-most-tariffs-to-10-but-increases-tariffs-on-china-to-125\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3ac5b5c6d62a2d4c2994e6f87ef1bdfed906ed2768f4c30632cf0f7b038a19d7","category":"Tech"}
