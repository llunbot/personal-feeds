This experience brings interactive coding capabilities, building upon existing prompt-based features. You now have a natural, real-time collaborative partner working alongside you while writing code, creating documentation, running tests, and reviewing changes.</p> \n<p>Amazon Q Developer transforms how you write and maintain code by providing transparent reasoning for its suggestions and giving you the choice between automated modifications or step-by-step confirmation of changes. As a daily user of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/build/\">Amazon Q Developer command line interface (CLI) agent</a>, I’ve experienced firsthand how Amazon Q Developer chat interface makes software development a more efficient and intuitive process. Having an AI-powered assistant only a <code>q chat</code> away in CLI has streamlined my daily development workflow, enhancing the coding process.</p> \n<p>The new agentic coding experience in Amazon Q Developer in the IDE seamlessly interacts with your local development environment. You can read and write files directly, execute bash commands, and engage in natural conversations about your code. Amazon Q Developer comprehends your codebase context and helps complete complex tasks through natural dialog, maintaining your workflow momentum while increasing development speed.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Let’s see it in action</strong></span><br /> To begin using Amazon Q Developer for the first time, follow the steps in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/getting-started-q-dev.html\">Getting Started with Amazon Q Developer</a> guide to access Amazon Q Developer. When using Amazon Q Developer, you can choose between <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-pro-tier.html\">Amazon Q Developer Pro</a>, a paid subscription service, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-free-tier.html\">Amazon Q Developer Free tier</a> with <a href=\"https://community.aws/builderid?trk=4f1e9f0e-7b21-4369-8925-61f67341d27c&amp;sc_channel=el\">AWS Builder ID</a> user authentication.</p> \n<p>For existing users, update to the new version. Refer to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-in-IDE.html\">Using Amazon Q Developer in the IDE</a> for activation instructions.</p> \n<p>To start, I select the Amazon Q icon in my IDE to open the chat interface. For this demonstration, I’ll create a web application that transforms Jupiter notebooks from the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-nova-samples?trk=4f1e9f0e-7b21-4369-8925-61f67341d27c&amp;sc_channel=code\">Amazon Nova sample repository</a> into interactive applications.</p> \n<p>I send the following prompt: <code>In a new folder, create a web application for video and image generation that uses the notebooks from multimodal-generation/workshop-sample as examples to create the applications. Adapt the code in the notebooks to interact with models. Use existing model IDs</code></p> \n<p>Amazon Q Developer then examines the ﬁles: the README file, notebooks, notes, and everything that is in the folder where the conversation is positioned. In our case it’s at the root of the repository.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/02/AWSNEWS-2205_01-1024x740.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"740\" /></p> \n<p>After completing the repository analysis, Amazon Q Developer initiates the application creation process. Following the prompt requirements, it requests permission to execute the bash command for creating necessary folders and files.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/02/AWSNEWS-2205_03-1024x908.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"908\" /></p> \n<p>With the folder structure in place, Amazon Q Developer proceeds to build the complete web application.</p> \n<p>In a few minutes, the application is complete. Amazon Q Developer provides the application structure and deployment instructions, which can be converted into a README file upon request in the chat.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/artifacts/AWSNews/2025/AWSNEWS-2205_03.gif\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></p> \n<p>During my initial attempt to run the application, I encountered an error. I described it in Spanish using Amazon Q chat.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/02/AWSNEWS-2205_04-1024x737.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"737\" /></p> \n<p>Amazon Q Developer responded in Spanish and gave me the solutions and code modifications in Spanish! I loved it!</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/02/AWSNEWS-2205_05-1-1024x742.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"742\" /></p> \n<p>After implementing the suggested fixes, the application ran successfully. Now I can create, modify, and analyze images and videos using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\">Amazon Nova</a> through this newly created interface.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/24/Screenshot-2025-04-24-at-6.12.02 PM-1024x696.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"696\" /></p> \n<p>The preceding images showcase my application’s output capabilities. Because I asked to modify the video generation code in Spanish, it gave me the message in Spanish.</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/24/generated-video-1024x704.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"704\" /></th> \n   <th><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/04/24/image-1024x702.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" /></th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n</table> \n<p><span><strong>Things to know</strong></span><br /> <strong>Chatting in natural languages</strong> – Amazon Q Developer IDE supports many languages, including English, Mandarin, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Korean, Hindi, and Portuguese.
