The laptops can be ordered now, with in-store availability and deliveries to customers set to begin on Friday, March 8.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we outline key new features added to the MacBook Air, including the M3 chip, Wi-Fi 6E, expanded external display support, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>M3 Chip</h2>\r<br />\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are now available with Apple's latest M3 chip for faster performance and improved power efficiency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs expected, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/first-benchmark-result-macbook-air-m3/\">early benchmark result</a> has revealed that the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip in the previous MacBook Air models in terms of CPU performance. These results are consistent with the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the M3 chip, the MacBook Air has also gained hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games, along with AV1 video decoding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Two External Displays</h2>\r<br />\nWhile previous MacBook Air models with Apple silicon officially support only one external display, the new models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/\">support two external displays</a>. However, a second display can only be used when the MacBook Air's lid is closed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the lid is open, the new models support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. When the lid is closed, a second display with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz can be connected, according to Apple's tech specs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEven more displays can be connected to the MacBook Air with the use of DisplayLink adapters. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wi-Fi 6E</h2>\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Airs support Wi-Fi 6E for \"up to twice as fast\" wireless download speeds compared to the previous models with Wi-Fi 6, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible device and router. The entire current-generation Mac lineup now supports Wi-Fi 6E.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Microphone Upgrades</h2>\r<br />\nApple says the microphones in the new MacBook Air models offer \"enhanced voice clarity in audio and video calls\" compared to the previous models. The microphones also gained support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/block-background-noise-facetime-mac/\">\"Voice Isolation\" and \"Wide Spectrum\" modes</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Fingerprint Seal for Midnight Color</h2>\r<br />\nJust <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/\">like the Space Black MacBook Pro</a>, the Midnight MacBook Air now features an \"anodization seal to reduce fingerprints,\" according to Apple.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/m3-macbook-air-features/\">New MacBook Air Launching on Friday With These 5 New Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-air-launching-on-friday-with-these-5-new-features.2421117/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b70346776132e4077712bfc92c93b9edbea47f71072e3755a129598d93f8a565","category":"Apple"}
