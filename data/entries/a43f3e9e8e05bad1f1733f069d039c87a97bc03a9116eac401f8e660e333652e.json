{"title":"iOS 18.3 Beta 3 Has Several Changes to Apple Intelligence Notification Summaries","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/16/ios-18-3-temporarily-disables-apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-for-select-apps-more/","date":1737152519000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here are the changes included in iOS 18.3 for Apple Intelligence\nnotification summaries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When you enable notification summaries, iOS 18.3 will make it\nclearer that the feature — like all Apple Intelligence features — is a beta.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can now disable notification summaries for an app directly\nfrom the Lock Screen or Notification Center by swiping, tapping\n“Options,” then choosing the “Turn Off Summaries” option.</p></li>\n<li><p>On the Lock Screen, notification summaries now use italicized\ntext to better distinguish them from normal notifications.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the Settings app, Apple now warns users that notification\nsummaries “may contain errors.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, notification summaries have been temporarily\ndisabled entirely for the News &amp; Entertainment category of apps.\nNotification summaries will be re-enabled for this category with a\nfuture software update as Apple continues to refine the\nexperience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Using italics for summarized notifications is a really clever design. It feels literary. Italics sounds like a different voice to me, which is exactly what these Apple-generated summaries are. Seems so obvious now that I’m seeing it in use, I’m kicking myself for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries\">not having suggested it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And while I can’t blame Apple for temporarily disabling notification summaries for news apps, after just one full day on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/everything-new-in-ios-18-3-beta-3/\">beta 3</a>, I already miss them. The mistakes were embarrassing, no question, but overall the summaries were useful for me.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/17/ios-18-3-beta-3-notification-summary-changes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a43f3e9e8e05bad1f1733f069d039c87a97bc03a9116eac401f8e660e333652e","category":"Tech"}
