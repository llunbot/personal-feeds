The hose slides out so you won’t yank or break off the valve stem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s just 78g (without holster) and inflates to 110psi, making it great for gravel, MTB, and “modern” road tubeless tires. It’s also tiny, measuring just 155mm long and 24.5mm round, which is enough to push plenty of air per stroke. MSRP is $40.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muc-off-17-in-1-mini-tool-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mucoff.sjv.io/c/2227671/1131496/14325?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmuc-off.com%2Fproducts%2F17-in-1-multi-tool\" target=\"_blank\">17-In-1 Minitool</a> has alloy side bars with Chromium-Vanadium Steel tools. It’s got (almost) all of what you’d need:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hex 2/2.5/3/4/5/6/8mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Phillips 1/2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>T25 Torx</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SL5 Flat Head</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bottle opener / spoke wrench: Shimano (4.3/4.4/hex4.6) / Mavic m7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Steel chain breaker for 9/10/11 speed</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming that chainbreaker will work with 12-speed chains, too (which, you could probably <em>make</em> it work), should be all good. The 75x43x10mm dimensions are big enough to get a hold of, and it’s only $25. Or $28 with a Cordura case, which is a good idea if you’re shoving it into a saddle bag or something right next to a tube so you don’t wear a hole in the tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://mucoff.sjv.io/c/2227671/1131496/14325?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmuc-off.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Muc-Off.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/muc-off-boosts-trailside-repairs-w-mini-pump-tool/\">Muc-Off Boosts Trailside Repairs w/ Mini Pump &amp; Tool</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"835efa5648229e276a5f5f83a1ac67efba0d16ac7304b991095d2563d39792fc","category":"Cycling"}
