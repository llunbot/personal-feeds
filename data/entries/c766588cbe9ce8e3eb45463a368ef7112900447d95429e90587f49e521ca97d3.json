With stack heights getting higher and higher, Yoshimura decided to engineer a stem that provides a 35mm rise and takes up less steer tube overall. When changing stem lengths, you no longer need to remove the entire stem; just change to the longer or shorter mount set. That means no more forks falling out, and no need to realign the handlebars which can be a pesky task with short stems.</p>\n<p>Have a DH bike? The ENDH converts to a direct mount stem. As a DH stem, length options are 45, 50, and 55mm while providing an 18mm rise.
