While both games are free to start, they will require $59.99 and $39.99 in-app purchases, respectively, to unlock the full experience. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPre-orders have since gone live for <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> on the iOS <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, which still lists the game as \"available 2023.\" Both games will support on screen controls, game controllers, multi-touch, HDR, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those who haven't been following these games, <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> were showcased during Apple's ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ announcement. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max are powered by an A17 Pro chip that features a brand new GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, enabling ported console games to be played on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> at near-equivalent performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisplayPort support is built into the USB-C port on all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models, meaning that the devices can also output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. On previous iPhones with a Lightning port, video mirroring is limited to 1080p with Apple's Lightning-to-HDMI or Lightning-to-VGA adapters.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince Apple's ‌iPhone 15‌ event, Capcom confirmed that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> will come to macOS and iPadOS devices with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> or better. <em>Resident Evil Village</em> is already available on macOS, so the iOS and iPadOS release will be a single purchase when it arrives just before Halloween with support for ‌M1‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> ‌iPad‌ models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/toucharcade/\">TouchArcade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/capcom/\">Capcom</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/resident-evil-village-iphone-15-pro-ipad-oct-30/\">Resident Evil Village for iPhone 15 Pro and iPad Launches October 30</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-village-for-iphone-15-pro-and-ipad-launches-october-30.2404542/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51c37e25b78bee85e0efa54f5daeffc7b89f5bdd810e2518acd2202cd659890e","category":"Apple"}
