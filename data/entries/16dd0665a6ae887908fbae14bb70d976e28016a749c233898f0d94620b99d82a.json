That said, most draft candidates are accepted.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the images are just designs that Emojipedia is guessing at, and each operating system maker (like Apple) will have their own custom designs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEmoji 14 has been under development for some time and has been delayed due to the ongoing global health crisis. After the final emoji candidates are decided on, smartphone makers will begin using them in late 2021 and 2022. There's a good chance that we won't see Apple adopt these new emoji until 2022 as there's often a delay of several months before new emojis make it onto iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWorld Emoji Day is coming up on July 17th, and in the past, Apple has given us insight into its future emoji plans in celebration of the day.
