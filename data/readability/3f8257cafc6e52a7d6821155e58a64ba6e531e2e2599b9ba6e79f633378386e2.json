Spinergy is rolling out some nifty technology with their new MTX and MTXe mountain bike wheelsets.

Spinergy says the foam keeps water out of your wheel, provides structural stiffness, and increased impact strength. It also dampens vibrations and deadens sound. All this should translate to better absorption of harsh impacts, improved control and reduced rider fatigue.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side.jpg\" alt=\"Spinergy MTX wheels, front, side\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/02235445/Spinergy-MTX-wheels-spokes-side-768x513.jpg 768w\"></a></p><p>The new wheelsets all feature Spinergy’s PBO fiber spokes. These synthetic fiber spokes are claimed to be three times stronger than steel, yet half the weight. They also help reduce vibrations for improved control and minimized fatigue.

These hubs were built tough with 44mm ratchet rings, new larger axles and CNC machined shells. The hubs promise rapid 108-point engagement, and simplicity with ‘plug and play’ axles and cassette bodies. Using slip-fit end caps, all MTX wheelsets can accommodate either QR, 15mm or 12mm front axles, and QR or 12mm rear axles in varying lengths (see details below).
