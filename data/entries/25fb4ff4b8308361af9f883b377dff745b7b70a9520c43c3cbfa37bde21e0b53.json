NASA and its contractors at Kennedy Space Center in Florida continue building a new mobile launch tower for the Space Launch System Block 1B rocket, a taller, upgraded version of the SLS rocket being used for the agency's initial Artemis lunar missions. Workers <a href=\"https://x.com/NASAGroundSys/status/1913193375236338167\">stacked another segment</a> of the tower a couple of weeks ago, and the structure is inching closer to its full height of 355 feet (108 meters). But this is just the start. Once the tower is fully assembled, it must be outfitted with miles of cabling, tubing, and piping, then tested before it can support an SLS launch campaign. Last year, NASA's inspector general projected the tower won't be ready for a launch until the spring of 2029 and its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasas-second-large-launch-tower-has-gotten-stupidly-expensive/\">costs could reach $2.7 billion</a>. The good news, if you can call it that, is there probably won't be an SLS Block 1B rocket that needs to use it in 2029, whether it's due to delays or cancellation.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.

The DOD contract announced last year supports the development of Rocket 4, a two-stage, mobile launch vehicle with ambitions to deliver cargo across the globe in under an hour. While Astra's ill-fated Rocket 3 focused on launching small satellites to low-Earth orbit, Astra wants to make Rocket 4 a military utility vehicle. Rocket 4 will still be able to loft conventional satellites, but Astra's most lucrative contract for the new launch vehicle involves using the rocket for precise point-to-point delivery of up to 1,300 pounds (590 kilograms) of supplies from orbit via specialized reentry vehicles. The military has shown interest in developing a rocket-based rapid global cargo delivery system for several years, and has a contract with SpaceX to study how the much larger Starship rocket could do a similar job.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/rocket-report-the-pitfalls-of-rideshare-china-launches-next-tiangong-crew/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/rocket-report-the-pitfalls-of-rideshare-china-launches-next-tiangong-crew/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"25fb4ff4b8308361af9f883b377dff745b7b70a9520c43c3cbfa37bde21e0b53","category":"Tech"}
