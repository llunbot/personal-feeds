But even if the profiles of these modernized road bikes don’t look all that new, their spec suggests some a rumored and often-discussed bombshell. Shimano 105 mechanical is likely getting a 12-speed makeover soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bianchi Oltre Race &amp; Sprint tease Shimano 105 12-speed mechanical groupset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Bianchi Oltre Race aero carbon road bike with Shimano 105 12-speed mechanical, aero line-up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Oltre-Race-aero-carbon-road-bike-line-up-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

But a lot of that comes down to the availability of a mechanical shift groupset vs. the electronic-only setups on many of the top-tier bikes. Both the Oltre Race &amp; Sprint include 105 Di2 &amp; 105 mechanical builds which are the Italian bike maker’s most budget options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Bianchi Sprint all-rounder carbon road bike with Shimano 105 12-speed mechanical, frame detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_frameset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the curious thing is that if you <a href=\"https://www.bianchi.com/bikes/bikes/road/racing-road/sprint/\" target=\"_blank\">look at the Sprint</a>, Bianchi is still listing the old version of the bike (<em>with visible external cables</em>) on their website for 2449€ with “<em>105 11SP</em>” or 3849€ with “<em>105 DI2</em>“. But the new version (<em>with hidden fully internal cables</em>) is offered for 2549€ with simply “<em>105</em>” and for the same 3849€ with “<em>105 DI2 12SP</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, that lack of number of gears and extra 100€ could be a fluke, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except… when you click on the new “<em>105</em>” bike, its <a href=\"https://www.bianchi.com/store/it_EN/ytbr5-sprint-10512sp-9.html\" target=\"_blank\">URL</a> has sprint-10512sp in the title, and then its spec goes on to detail a “<em>Shimano 105 12sp,12- speed</em>” crankset, rear derailleur, and front derailleur. There’s no mention of the gearing ratios on the bike – other than that the front derailleur can handle up to a 54T chainring, and the rear mech can handle a max 36T cog on the cassette.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Bianchi Sprint all-rounder carbon road bike with Shimano 105 12-speed mechanical, previewed with Ultegra 2x11 mechanical\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Bianchi-Sprint-all-rounder-carbon-road-bike-with-Shimano-105-12-speed-mechanical_shown-with-ultegra-2x11-1-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The images on the website all show bikes built older generation Ultegra 11-sp mechanical – and include an unsurprising note saying, “<em>The image shown is indicative only.

This rebadged Bianchi Oltre Race road bike is also offered only with Shimano 105 groupsets, here for either 3399€ with the Shimano 105 mechanical, or for 4349€ with 105 Di2 groupset. The mechanical Oltre Race spec does not specifically reference 12-speeds like the Sprint (and it is also still the same retail price as the previous<em> generation Aria with 11sp 105</em>), but its URL still does, so you can likely expect the unreleased groupset here, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for actual availability… since the groupset doesn’t exist yet, you are going to have to wait for sure. You can ask your local Bianchi dealer when they expect to have the new bikes in stock. But we’re gonna guess you’ll have to wait at least until Shimano unveils 12-sp 105 mechanical to get a concrete answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.bianchi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bianchi.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bianchi-oltre-race-sprint-aero-road-bikes-tease-shimano-mechanical-105-12-speed/\">Bianchi Oltre Race &amp; Sprint Aero Road Bikes Tease Shimano Mechanical 105 12sp!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0d9e36e5f576dc134737a65672046c7b48f22232a686a2fcc7a5c50b340c3f9a","category":"Cycling"}
