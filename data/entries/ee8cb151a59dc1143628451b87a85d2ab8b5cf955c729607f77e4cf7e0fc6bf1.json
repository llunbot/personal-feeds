Available in one or two-bike sizes, the cover has an elastic hem to help keep it in place and is secured around the bike’s frame by Velcro. The cover comes with its own storage bag; at 580g, it’s heavier duty than some options here, but on the downside Decathlon doesn’t claim that it’s waterproof and it will only protect your bike from light rain. </p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pro Bike Tool Bike Cover</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"569\" height=\"578\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Pro-Bike-tool-bike-cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Pro-Bike-tool-bike-cover.jpg 569w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Pro-Bike-tool-bike-cover-295x300.jpg 295w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Pro-Bike-tool-bike-cover-75x75.jpg 75w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£29.99 | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Bike-Outdoor-Bicycle-Storage/dp/B01N78KNVD/\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not the Shimano sub-brand, but sold via Amazon, the Pro Bike Tool cover is available in three sizes, to fit up to three bikes.

It’s waterproof and UV resistant and has a built-in groundsheet, as well as folding into its own storage bag. It would be a good option for travelling, as well as for home storage.
