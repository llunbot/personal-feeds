Under UK law, affected users are automatically included in the claim unless they opt out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKent argues that while the App Store was initially \"a brilliant gateway\" for services, it has become \"the only gateway\" for millions of consumers, with Apple acting as a monopolist by blocking access to alternative platforms that could offer better deals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has firmly rejected the allegations, calling the lawsuit \"meritless,\" and says that its App Store commission rates are \"very much in the mainstream\" compared to other digital marketplaces. The company says that 85% of apps on the App Store are free, and many developers qualify for a reduced 15% commission rate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal is expected to last seven weeks and is one of several legal challenges Apple faces globally regarding its App Store practices. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe company is also defending against a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-fails-block-uk-app-store-lawsuit/\">separate £785 million UK lawsuit</a> related to developer fees and was recently fined €500 million ($538 million) by the European Commission for breaching digital competition rules <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/apple-fined-500-million-eu-music-probe/\">relating to music streaming services</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/apple-uk-lawsuit-app-store-overcharging/\">Apple Faces £1.5 Billion UK Lawsuit Over App Store 'Overcharging'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-faces-£1-5-billion-uk-lawsuit-over-app-store-overcharging.2447302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60bc78cf42fc1e681c8409f47572b2795db37c7d37bcb3572f718648ef3be11b","category":"Apple"}
