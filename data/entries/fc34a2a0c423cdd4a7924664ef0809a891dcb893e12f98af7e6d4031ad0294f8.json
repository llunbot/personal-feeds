This is good news if you are on the hunt for a pair of headphones with a wired connection because you now don’t need an adaptor to use USB-C headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of benefits to using USB-C headphones. Wired connections (generally) deliver better audio quality because the audio doesn’t need to be compressed as much as with wireless, so near-lossless audio can be possible. However, you should still expect expensive, high-quality wireless headphones to sound better than a pair of cheap USB-C headphones. You can only get true lossless playback with a wired connection. The only issue really is that most of the streamers compress the music, so even if your headphones are capable of producing high-quality audio the audio files may not be high quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other benefits of USB-C headphones include faster charging and the ability to play audio and charge at the same time. They get their power from the device so you don’t have to charge them up separately and you don’t need to worry about them running flat (unless your iPhone or iPad does). However, you won’t be able to charge your iPhone at the same time (unless you charge wirelessly).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some headphones have a DAC onboard that converts the signal to digital and can enable high-res playback. Not all DAC are equal though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other benefits include the fact that the headphones are connected by a cable so you are less likely to lose one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are disadvantages though. Some people prefer wireless though because you can get cable noise from when the cable rubs on your clothing. Another thing is that wired headphones don’t tend to offer active noise cancellation. If you do want to use <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668628/best-wireless-headphones.html\">wireless headphones with your iPhone</a> we have a separate story, and you may also like our comparison of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/201379/best-over-ear-headphones-airpods-max-vs-the-competition.html\">AirPods Max vs other over-ear headphones</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headphones that have USB-C should work with Macs that have USB-C too – although most Macs do still have a standard 3.5mm headphone socket that will work with conventional headphones. One thing to remember is that some headphones use a USB-C connector for charging – but may not allow you to play audio via a USB-C cable, so check on that before buying any new headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Older iPhones and the standard 10.2in iPad feature a Lightning port. There are a small number of manufacturers that still make headphones with a Lightning connector, which are specifically designed for use with the iPhone. However, now that the European Union has forced Apple to move to USB-C for charging iPhones, it’s unlikely that there will be many Lightning-powered headphones available in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s one other option as well. You can still use traditional headphones that have a standard 3.5mm audio connector with an iPhone or iPad – although you will need a suitable adaptor or cable that has a 3.5mm connector for the headphones and a Lightning or USB-C connector for your Apple devices. Apple sells 3.5mm headphone jack adaptors with both Lightning connectors for <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668694-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">$9</a>/<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668694-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MMX62ZM/A/lightning-to-35mm-headphone-jack-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">£9</a> and USB-C for <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668694-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">$9</a>/<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668694-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MU7E2ZM/A/usb-c-to-35mm-headphone-jack-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">£9</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other companies sell adaptors too – most notably Belkin, with its Rockstar or Connect Lightning to 3.5mm adaptors (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Charge-Rockstar-Adapter-Charging/dp/B074WDWVX1/ref=sr_1_3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$39.99 at Amazon US</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Belkin-Charge-Rockstar-Adapter-Charging/dp/B074WDWVX1/ref=sr_1_4?&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">£29 at Amazon UK</a>), which provide multiple ports and connectors so that you can charge your iPhone or iPad and listen to music at the same time.

Priced at just £159.99/$179.95, the Accentum’s strong sound quality and impressive battery life make it a great alternative to more expensive rivals such as the Beats Studio Pro (or the wildly overpriced AirPods Max).</p>\n\n<p>Available in black or white, the Accentum is a lightweight and comfortable set of over-ear headphones, weighing 222g and providing thickly padded earpieces and headband for long listening sessions. The lightweight plastic design could, perhaps, be a little sturdier, but the Accentum should still be tough enough to cope with a few bumps in a backpack when you’re out and about (although one sign of cost-cutting is that there’s no carrying case included).</p>\n\n<p>The Accentum provides Bluetooth 5.2 for wireless audio, with support for the AAC codec for Apple devices and aptX HD for the Android side of the fence. There’s also a USB-C connector on the right-hand earpiece, which can be used both for charging and for wired audio connections when required – although, oddly, the cable in the box is USB-C-to-USB-A, so you’ll need to provide your own USB-C cable or adaptor for Macs or iPads that only have USB-C.</p>\n\n<p>Sound quality is very good in both modes. The Accentum digs deep for the slinky bass riff on Leonard Cohen’s You Want It Darker, and really catches the gritty rumble in Cohen’s deeper-than-deep voice. It’s not just about the bass though, and the Accentum is still able to pull out the sharp tap of the snare drum and lends a silky smoothness to the synagogue choir on backing vocals. The noise-cancellation features are something of a mixed bag, though. The Accentum deals very effectively with low-frequency sounds, such as the rumble of an aircraft engine, but it’s less successful at blocking out voices and higher frequencies. And, somewhat strangely, you don’t have the option of turning noise-cancellation completely off – you can only switch between full noise-cancellation or the ‘transparent’ mode that lets in some background noise when you need to hear what’s going on around you. However, the real clincher for many people will be the Accentum’s 50-hour battery life, which is great for a headphone in this price range and leaves most of its rivals trailing in its wake.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.  1More Penta Driver P50\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"4000\" height=\"4000\" alt=\"1More Penta Driver P50\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1More-P50-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGreat value for money\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tExcellent sound quality\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood set of accessories\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo Bluetooth or noise-cancellation\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCables can be a little fiddly\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPassive noise-isolation only\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$169.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://usa.1more.com/products/1more-penta-driver-headphones-p50&amp;xcust=1-1-668694-6-2227145-16335&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$169.99 at  1More</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCV6L42L?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$169.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><em>Connectivity: USB-C or 3.5mm</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://uk.1more.com&amp;xcust=1-1-668694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">1More</a> has been long been a champion of wired earbuds, and was one of the few companies to continue producing models with a Lightning interface long after most of its rivals had switched to Bluetooth instead.</p>\n\n<p>Its latest earbuds, called the Penta Driver P50, are actually a bit of a throwback, as they go back to using a traditional 3.5mm analogue connector, and even have in-line controls for Pause/Play and adjusting volume too. However, 1More also includes a USB-C adaptor as well, so you can use the P50 with Macs, iPads and iPhones that have USB-C (you can use them with Lightning devices too, although you’ll need to buy your own Lightning adaptor).</p>\n\n<p>The wired earpieces are designed to hook back over your ears, which helps to keep them safely in place even when you’re jogging or exercising. There are no less than five sets of silicon eartips in different sizes, and even three sets of foam eartips too (which I much prefer for a firm fit and blocking out background noise), along with handy little carrying pouch too.</p>\n\n<p>Priced at $169.99/£169.99, the P50 is great value for money. Designed very much for demanding audiophiles, the earbuds manage to squeeze five separate driver units into each earpiece – compared to just one for most earbuds in this price range – and have Hi-Res Audio certification so that they can handle the highest quality audio formats available on Apple Music and other streaming services.</p>\n\n<p>And, as you might expect, the penta-driver design sounds great. It launches into the 2018 reissue of Sweet’s glam classic, Ballroom Blitz with a crisp, firm thud on the drums. There’s a warm, smooth tone to Brian Connolly’s lead vocal, but the P50 catches the camp flourish in Steve Priest’s piercing falsetto as he declares – “and she thinks she’s the passionate one!”. The chopping guitar between verses is sharp and gritty, and then the P50 swoops lower for the catchy bass-and-drum break in the middle eight. Some people might prefer wired headphones with a larger over-ear design and extra features such as noise-cancellation, but if you just want a lightweight and affordable set of earbuds that provide high-quality sound when you’re traveling then the P50 is hard to beat.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

The Moshi Avanti C come with USB-C, but Moshi also makes a second model, called the Avanti LT, that includes both a detachable Lightning cable for older Apple devices and a conventional 3.5mm cable that provides compatibility with a wider range of smartphones and other audio devices.</p>\n\n<p>The headphones themselves are smartly designed, and available in a variety of different colors. The on-ear design means that they’re quite compact, and the earpieces fold inwards so that you can easily slip them into the carrying case that’s provided for when you’re traveling.</p>\n\n<p>They sound great too, thanks to a frequency range of 15Hz – 22kHz. That allows them to provide a really nice, firm bass on dance tracks such as Prime Evil by The Orb, while also reaching right up to the glass-cutting falsetto of Roger Taylor on Queen’s Lap Of The Gods.</p>\n\n<p>High-quality sound, portable design and useful accessories ensure that the Avanti LT headphones can really earn their keep both at home and when you’re traveling – and, unlike most Lightning headphones, you can use them with non-Apple devices too.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative from Moshi you might be interested in is the Moshi Mythro Lightning In-Ear Headphones, which are $99.99 from <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Moshi-Mythro-Lightning-Wired-In-Ear-Headphone-Silver/739802355&amp;subid1=1-1-668694-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>.

But the Internet says that the cool kids are wearing wired headphones again these days – it’s a retro thing, apparently – and the EarPods are still available for people who prefer a simple and affordable set of wired earbuds. </p>\n\n<p>There are actually three versions available, each costing just $19/£19, with either a USB-C connector, a Lightning connector or a standard 3.5mm audio connector for older iPhones or iPad models that still have ye olde headphone connector. That 3.5mm connector will work with other audio devices too and, of course, a wired connection means that you don’t have to worry about the battery running down in the middle of a long journey.</p>\n\n<p>The design of the EarPods was updated a few years ago, with a more oval-shaped earpiece that is designed to rest more easily inside the ear. However, they still have the same one-size-fits-all design of the original EarPods, with no option to use silicon tips in different sizes, so they’re probably not the best choice for people who need a good, firm fit for working out or jogging around the park.</p>\n\n<p>You’re not going to get Hi-Fi quality headphones at this price, but the wired connection avoids the compromises caused by the limited bandwidth of Bluetooth, so the EarPods still provide respectable sound quality. The bass sounds nice and firm, and our only complaint is that higher frequencies can sound a little thin at times.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.

However, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.belkin.com&amp;xcust=1-1-668694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin</a> surprised us by releasing its  SoundForm Headphones With Lightning Connector, priced at $39.99/£29.99. There is also a USB-C version of the SoundForm headphones for $/£14.99. </p>\n\n<p>Despite their low price, the SoundForm headphones – which used to be called Rockstar, but have been rebranded – are sturdily built, with a chunky, flat cable that reduces tangles when you shove them into your pocket.</p>\n\n<p>The inline controls are fairly basic – just a little microphone for voice calls, a couple of buttons for volume adjustment, and a Play/Pause button that controls music and phone calls. And, at this price, there’s not a lot in the way of added extras either – there’s no carrying case, and just three sizes of silicon ear-tips, although that should be enough to provide a good, comfortable fit for most people.</p>\n\n<p>Belkin also says the headphones are water-resistant – although it doesn’t quote an IP rating – so they should be a good, affordable option for jogging around the park or working out at the gym.</p>\n\n<p>Sound quality is a pleasant surprise too, given the low price. The SoundForm delivered the multi-layered bombast of Bohemian Rhapsody with clarity and detail. Smaller, less expensive earbuds such as these often suffer from weak bass, but the SoundForm also managed to dig down to the deep, sinister electronic bass on Prime Evil by The Orb.</p>\n\n<p>Our only concern is that the sound quality is very dependent on getting a good, firm fit inside your ears, but as long as the ear-tips provided by Belkin fit you properly then the SoundForm is the best set of budget-priced Lightning headphones we’ve seen so far.

Available in black or tan, the padded headband and earpieces feel absolutely luxurious (although the leather covering might not suit everyone). The adjustable cast-aluminum armatures look very smart and are sturdy enough to cope with life on the road when you’re traveling, and there’s a hard-shell carrying case included as well.</p>\n\n<p>The 40mm drivers support Bluetooth with support for both Apple’s AAC and aptX Adaptive for Android users. As mentioned, there’s a USB-C interface for wired connections and lossless audio, and a 3.5mm adaptor is included for good old-fashioned analog audio as well. The sound quality is as good as you’d expect from a company with B&amp;W’s hi-fi heritage. There’s an icy clarity to the steel guitar on You Can’t Trust Violence by Low, and the band’s harmonies are smooth as silk, even as they repeat the chilling chorus of “no, you can’t trust violence…”. There’s a nice bass sound too, bouncing along with a firm, infectious rhythm on Bad Guy by Billie Eilish, and contrasting well with the sharp, precise finger snaps that set the pace and drive the track forward.</p>\n\n<p>The noise-cancellation features work very well too, and with 30 hours of battery life when using Bluetooth and noise-cancellation the Px8 is a great option for frequent fliers or commuting on a train. The luxurious design and sound quality of the Px8 are worth every penny, but if you’re on a tight budget then you can still find the previous Px7 S2 model available online with a recent price cut to £299, which makes it a real bargain</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7.

They might have Wireless in the name, but there’s a USB-C port than can be used for wired audio. </p>\n\n<p>The fourth-generation Momentum is a bit more compact and streamlined than its predecessors, with the weight now reduced to just 293g in order to ensure that it’s light and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Even so, Sennheiser has still managed to squeeze an impressive range of features into the headphones, starting with 42mm drivers that are larger than those used by most of its rivals. These also provide an impressive frequency response of 6Hz – 22KHz, which again beats most rival headphones in this price range.</p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Momentum 4 provides excellent sound quality. It digs deep and delivers a taut, menacing bass pulse on <em>You Should See Me In A Crown </em>by Billie Eilish. The higher frequencies work well too, capturing Billie’s whispered vocals with great clarity, and picking out the edgy ticking of percussion that gives the song its manic energy.</p>\n\n<p>The digital features are right up to date as well, with Bluetooth 5.2, and support for both AAC for Apple devices and aptX Adaptive for Android. The USB-C port on the right earpiece can be used for charging but also supports USB audio for wired connections, and there’s a 2.5mm analog line-in connector too (with cable provided). However, the USB cable provided by Sennheiser is USB-A-to-USB-C, so you’ll need to provide your own USB-C adaptor for Macs, iPhones and iPads that only have USB-C.</p>\n\n<p>The noise-cancellation features work very well, and Sennheiser’s Smart Control app lets you adjust the level of noise-cancellation manually, by using a slider control, or you can just select the ‘adaptive’ option which allows the Momentum to monitor background noise and adjust the noise-cancellation automatically.</p>\n\n<p>But, even with all those features, the really outstanding feature of the Momentum 4 Wireless is its battery life – lasting for around 60 hours even when using Bluetooth and noise-cancellation together. There’s a good set of accessories too, with a hard-shell carrying case and airline adaptor provided for when you’re traveling. And, with a competitive $379.95/£309.99 price, the Momentum 4 Wireless even manages to undercut the price of the new Beats Studio Pro as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.

Priced at $599/£539, and available in a variety of colors, the MW75 oozes quality, constructed out of lightweight aluminum and tempered glass, and with a padded headband and earpieces wrapped in soft leather (although, of course, the choice of leather may not be to everyone’s taste). The earpieces are relatively small for an ‘over-ear’ headphone, though, and some people might find the fit a bit snug. The little control buttons on the earpieces are also rather small as well.</p>\n\n<p>It’s got a classy design on the inside too, with 40mm drivers that are constructed out of Beryllium – a very rigid material used in many high-end Hi-Fi systems in order to reduce vibration and distortion that might affect the sound quality. The MW75 supports Bluetooth with both AAC for Apple devices and aptX Adaptive for Android, and there’s a USB-C port for wired connections with support for lossless and high-res audio formats up to 24-bit/96KHz. </p>\n\n<p>There’s also a USB-A adaptor included for older computers, a 3.5mm adaptor for analog input, and a 6.3mm adaptor for use with high-end hi-fi equipment. Travelers will also appreciate the smart, fabric-covered hard-shell carrying case and airline adaptor, as well as healthy battery life that lasts for 28 hours when using Bluetooth and noise-cancellation together (or 32 hours without noise-cancellation).</p>\n\n<p>The noise-cancellation features are very effective and, like most headphones these days, the MW75 includes an ambient mode that lets in some of the background noise when required. However, there’s also an additional ‘voice’ mode that helps to pick out people’s voices if you’re in an office or perhaps waiting for a flight announcement in an airport.</p>\n\n<p>But, as always, the sound quality is key, and the MW75 provides excellent clarity and detail right across the spectrum. It provides a deep, ominous rumble for the electronic bass on Max Richter’s Shadow Journal, but it doesn’t allow the bass to overwhelm the piercing clarity of the violin, or the gentle ambient sound-cloud of electronic loops that swirl lightly through the air.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.

However, it also makes some more affordable headphones, such as the Hi-X25BT, which provides impressive sound quality for a very affordable $179/£135.</p>\n\n<p>As the name suggests, the Hi-X25BT does include Bluetooth to provide a wireless option when required, with an impressive 30 hours of battery life in Bluetooth mode. It’s not at its best with Bluetooth, though, as it doesn’t support either Apple’s AAC or AptX for Android, relying on the more basic SBC codec for wireless audio. </p>\n\n<p>The emphasis, therefore, is more on using the Hi-X25BT as a set of wired headphones via its USB-C connector. Austrian includes two cables with the headphones, with a USB-C-to-3.5mm connector that provides standard analogue audio, or a straightforward USB-C cable that provides digital audio from an iPad, Mac or other devices that have USB-C. There’s also a USB-A adaptor included too, and I had no trouble using the Hi-X25BT with both USB-A and 3.5mm connections on my ageing office iMac. I also found a Lightning audio adaptor from Belkin in my desk draw, which allowed me to use the Hi-X25BT with a Lightning connection on my iPhone as well – although, of course, this isn’t included with the headphones, so you’d need to provide your own adaptor for an iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>And, as you’d expect from a company with Austrian’s Hi-Fi background, the sound quality is great, thanks to 40mm drivers with impressive 12Hz – 24KHz frequency response. The cymbal crash that starts Blondie’s Rapture rings out crisp and clear, with a loose relaxed feel on the jangling rhythm guitar. The song’s bouncing bass line works a treat too, and never gets lost in the mix as can sometimes happen with less precise headphones.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Can I just use an adapter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer to stick with an existing set of 3.5mm wired headphones that you really like then it is possible to buy an adapter. And, in fact, Apple did include a Lightning adapter with the iPhone 7, 8 and X when they were first launched. Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case with current iPhones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can still buy Apple’s Lightning To 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter for £9/$9  <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668694-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MMX62ZM/A/lightning-to-35mm-headphone-jack-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">from the Apple Store</a>, but it’s also possible to buy non-Apple alternatives from audio specialists, such as Fiio’s i1, which provides superior sound quality, but  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/FiiO-i1-Amplifier-Lightning-Microphone-black/dp/B071R7DYHD?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">costs around £69</a>.
