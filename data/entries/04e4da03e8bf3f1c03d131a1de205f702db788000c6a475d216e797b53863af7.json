[...]</p>\n\n<p>“It doesn’t bother us that we are second, third, fourth or fifth\nif we still have the best. We don’t feel embarrassed because it\ntook us longer to get it right,” says Cook.</p>\n\n<p>“For Apple, being the best is the most important and trumps the\nother two by far.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been one of Apple’s guiding mantras for decades, and it has served the company very well. But it stops holding water when <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino\">they promise to be first</a>, but then aren’t first <em>and</em> aren’t the best.</p>\n\n<p>If you only ever promise A, B, and C — and never mention X, Y, or Z — even when competitors ship their versions of X, Y, and Z first, your silence speaks for itself. Either you don’t think X, Y, and Z are important, or, you think it’s worth taking more time to get them right. But if you promise A, B, C, X, Y, and Z, and then only ship A, B, and C, you just look lost when competitors ship X, Y, and Z.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/15/best-vs-first\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"04e4da03e8bf3f1c03d131a1de205f702db788000c6a475d216e797b53863af7","category":"Tech"}
