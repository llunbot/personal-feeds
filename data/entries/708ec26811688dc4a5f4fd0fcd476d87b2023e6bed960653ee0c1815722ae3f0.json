Now riding for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/trek-segafredo\" target=\"_blank\">Trek-Segafredo</a>, Lizzie’s palmarès includes World Champs stripes, the Tour of Flanders, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, the Women’s Tour, Strade Bianche and of course the first ever women’s Paris-Roubaix in 2021. And those are just the highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke to Lizzie on the eve of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-classique-2023\" target=\"_blank\">RideLondon Classique</a>, which marked her return to racing on British soil after having her second child. The interview took place in a hotel cafe, so apologies for the background noise – we hope it’s not too distracting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our chat begins at 5:17.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/81-lizzie-deignan-returns-to-the-pro-peloton\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 81 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>This episode is supported by H.V.M.N, the creators of Ketone-IQ.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We hear a lot about ketones in the pro peloton, but what are they?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>According to the experts at H.V.M.N, ketones are a natural source of fuel for your body. When stored carbs are depleted, your body starts to convert fat into ketones. Studies show that ketones are 28% more efficient than glucose, making them a super-efficient fuel source for the brain and the body.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These benefits led H.V.M.N to create Ketone-IQ: a drinkable ketone designed to support energy, focus and endurance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Developed alongside the U.S. military, Ketone-IQ is one of the most powerful ketone supplements on the market. It’s designed to elevate your ketone levels for up to 4 hours – much longer than other products. Plus, it’s vegan, caffeine free, and compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s guidelines. That’s a major win for athletes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ketone-IQ Shots are the best way to get your ketones on the go. They’re portable, convenient, and fit perfectly in your pocket during a ride or a race.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can save 20% on Ketone-IQ using the promo code CYCLIST at <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?\" target=\"_blank\">https://hvmn.com/CYCLIST?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about achieving your ultimate metabolic potential, subscribe to H.V.M.N’s podcast ‘Health Via Modern Nutrition with Dr Latt Mansor’ on iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube.
