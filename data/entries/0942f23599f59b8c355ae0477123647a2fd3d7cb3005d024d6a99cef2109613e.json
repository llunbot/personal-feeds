Paired with the RockShox 140mm Pike Ultimate fork and Super Deluxe <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-rear-shocks/\">rear shock</a>, this translates to a bike that is unflappable and right at home on twisty, steep descents.</p>\n<p>When it comes to climbing, ample space between the saddle and bar lets you put your body weight in the right place and the suspension robs very few watts.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the bike has a full <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-deore-xt-m8100-review/\">Shimano XT M8100 groupset</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/dt-swiss-ex-1501-spline-one-30-review/\">DT Swiss EXC 1501 wheels</a>, making this bike not just a great performer but excellent value for money too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/bird-aether-9-review/\">Read our full Bird Aether 9 (2021) review </a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Boardman MTR 8.9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Angled pack shot of the Boardman MTR 8.9 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Boardman MTR 8.9 - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boardman MTR 8.9 has the same geometry as the MTR 9.0.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd  / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£1,750 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Fantastic all-rounder</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Limits become clear on extreme terrain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Boardman MTR 8.9 has the same geometry and suspension as the pricier MTR 9.0.</p>\n<p>It has a well-chosen spec that balances cost, performance and strength, with a RockShox front fork, a<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\"> SRAM NX Eagle</a> drivetrain and Maxxis tyres.</p>\n<p>The triple-butted alloy frame looks purposeful and has externally routed cables, making for easy maintenance. There is a bottle mount too, but we found there to be minimal clearance.</p>\n<p>The geometry is modern but not extreme with a generous reach, leading to a comfortable ride.</p>\n<p>You do have to shift your weight forward to keep front-wheel traction over tricky ascents, and downhill the bike is fairly noisy. So really this is a bike for speedy trail centre rides, rather than super-challenging terrain.</p>\n<p>The bike is also ripe for upgrades and, with a few parts swapped out, we think it would be great as a lightweight, mile-munching machine.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/boardman-mtr-8-9-review/\">Read our full Boardman MTR 8.9 review</a></li>\n<li><strong>Buy now</strong> from<strong> <a href=\"https://www.halfords.com/bikes/mountain-bikes/boardman-mtr-8.9-mens-mountain-bike-2021---s-m-l-xl-frames-371086.html\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cannondale Habit 4</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale Habit 4 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Cannondale Habit 4 - 22\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cannondale’s updated Habit is fast rolling and loves to jib.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£2,300 / $2,300 / €2,699 / AU$4,399 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Well-balanced; confidence-inspiring ride; fun and flicky</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Shimano Deore drivetrain can be a little clunky</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Habit 4 impressed us with its playful and balanced ride feel.</p>\n<p>Its aluminium frame features size-specific geometry.

While this build costs £4,695, pricing starts at €3,300 for the German brand’s bike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/propain-hugene-custom-review/\">Read our full Propain Hugene Custom review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vitus Escarpe 29 CRS</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus Escarpe 29 CRS full suspension trail mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus Escarpe 29 CRS -\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vitus Escarpe CRS offers serious bang-for-buck.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£3,200 / $3,599 / €3,899 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Super-smooth and confident descending; stunning value for money</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited climbing performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vitus is becoming synonymous with value for money, with the Chain Reaction direct brand giving the Escarpe 29 CRS a similar treatment.</p>\n<p>The full carbon fibre frame has 140mm of rear travel controlled by a RockShox Deluxe Select+ and the front end is supported by a 150mm RockShox Lyrik Select.</p>\n<p>The Escarpe is more descent-focused compared to other trail bikes, with its climbing performance limited by pedal bob and increased sag on steeper pitches.</p>\n<p>Downhill, the bike smooths terrain and offers a confidence-inspiring ride over a broad range of trails.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/vitus-escarpe-29-crs-review-2/\">Read our full Vitus Escarpe 29 CRS review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Boardman MTR 9.0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Boardman MTR 9.0\" title=\"Boardman MTR 9.0\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Boardman’s MTR 9.0 is great on the downs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£2,000 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Rides with confidence and has excellent brakes; RockShox fork and rear shock</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Contact points detract from overall package</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The MTR 9.0 is Boardman’s flagship mountain bike, with an upgraded alloy frame, 150mm RockShox fork, a Deluxe Select+ rear shock and a groupset that is, by and large, comprised of Shimano SLX-level parts.</p>\n<p>The bike is happiest heading downhill, where it feels planted, and the Shimano SLX four-piston brakes provide a whole load of stopping power.</p>\n<p>The MTR climbs reasonably well.

It has SRAM SX 12-speed gearing with a 1x setup, a Trans-X dropper post and Shimano hydraulic brakes. In short, what you’d expect from a pricier bike.</p>\n<p>When it comes to ride performance, the Titan X’s suspension works surprisingly well, making this bike a good shout over a hardtail – which is normally the go-to option at this price point.</p>\n<p>When climbing, the Titan X’s frame is a little cramped due to its relatively old-school geometry, but it winches up hills better than you might expect.</p>\n<p>The only real drawback to the Titan X is the limited sizing, and taller riders should stay clear. This is a real try-before-you-buy bike, but if it fits and you’re on a budget, it’s a compelling option.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/carrera-titan-x-review/\">Read our full Carrera Titan X review</a></li>\n<li><strong>Buy now</strong> from <a href=\"https://www.halfords.com/bikes/mountain-bikes/carrera-titan-x-mens-full-suspension-mountain-bike---s-m-l-frames-850682.html\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cotic Jeht Silver Mullet</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cotic Jeht Silver Mullet full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Cotic Jeht Silver Mullet - pack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cotic Jeht can be run with a 29in or Mullet wheel size.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£3,989 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Composed and confident; smooth feeling suspension</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Stiff suspension under braking; feels large</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cotic Jeft is made from Reynolds 853 steel with a steel-alloy rear triangle that has 140mm of suspension travel.</p>\n<p>Its long, low and slack geometry is on point and allows you to let the bike run through the techiest of sections while still feeling in control.</p>\n<p>The Jeht is a fairly tall bike, and when braking the rear suspension isn’t as good as some of the competition, especially those bikes using a four-bar design.</p>\n<p>The spec can be matched to your pockets, with our test bike featuring an upgraded RockShox Revelation fork with a Charger 2.1 damper.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cotic-jeht-silver-mullet-review/\">Read our full Cotic Jeht Silver Mullet review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Focus JAM 8.9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Focus JAM 8.9\" title=\"Focus-Jam-8.9---AL\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Focus JAM 8.9 has a playful, planted ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£4,799 / €4,699 / AU$6,999 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressive suspension maintains ground contact well; clever internal frame storage</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Hefty weight; complicated stem design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With 150mm of travel, the JAM 8 series bikes get a carbon front triangle with neat internal storage and share geometry with the alloy JAM 6 series.

Adjustable rear dropouts enable you to fine-tune your ride or go singlespeed.</p>\n<p>There’s bags of stability on steep descents and the bike is great at carving wide corners, but shorten the rear end and direction changes come really easily. You’ve got a 203mm rotor at the front and 180mm out back to help control your speed.</p>\n<p>The Honzo’s steep 77.5-degree seat tube helps with climbing and it’s got plenty of room for the long-travel TransX dropper post.</p>\n<p>We were impressed by the climbing performance, aided by a 30t chainring and a wide-range 10-51t cassette, while the bike’s length means you can shift your weight around both up and downhill. It’s a hardcore hardtail that shows you don’t need suspension out back to have fun.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/kona-honzo-esd-review/\">Read our full Kona Honzo review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Marin Rift Zone XR 27.5</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Marin Rift Zone XR 27.5 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Marin Rift Zone XR 27.5 - pack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Marin Rift Zone XR 27.5 offers a playful and precise ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd /Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£3,095 / $3,500 / €3,499 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Well-designed frame; excellent rear suspension</li>\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Brakes lack bite; not the best climber</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Marin Rift Zone XR is built on the alloy Rift Zone frameset which provides top-notch rear suspension while prioritising front-end control.</p>\n<p>The Fox Float X rear shock works well to support the rear end, giving the bike playfulness without sacrificing grip.</p>\n<p>The bike’s poppy character makes for an engaging ride, though the bike requires rider attention on gnarlier sections of trail.</p>\n<p>A ‘sit up and spin’ attitude to climbing is provided by the upright and relaxed position, with the bike featuring more pedal bob than its competitors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/marin-rift-zone-xr-27-5-review/\">Read our full Marin Rift Zone XR 27.5 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Polygon Siskiu T7 29</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Polygone Siskiu T7 29 full suspension trail mountain bike\" title=\"Polygon Sisiu T7 - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Polygon Siskiu T7 29 is a high-end entry-level bike engineered to balance high-speed control with playful handling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£1,800 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Great trail geometry; impressive value for money</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Brakes are a weak point</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Polygon features modern trail geometry and decent components that make it very capable on the descents, with the 65.5-degree head angle giving confidence on even the steepest terrain.</p>\n<p>A RockShox Deluxe Select+ controls 135mm of rear-suspension travel, while a 140mm RockShox Recon Silver RL fork supports the front.

This will grab some riders’ attention because, when paired with the 150mm/141mm of travel available, this bike accelerates at any whiff of a descent. And with powerful four-piston brakes, you’ll probably find yourself wanting to let it go.</p>\n<p>The long geometry does impact agility, though, and getting the front end up and over obstacles takes a bit of work.</p>\n<p>Common wisdom might suggest that such a long bike wouldn’t make a great climber, but the steep head tube helps counter the long wheelbase and makes this bike great on ascents. The rear suspension, which is incredibly stable, helps too.</p>\n<p>Combine all this with a great spec, and on the face of it the Privateer 141 is an excellent trail bike. But the handling can be slightly unruly which, given how far trail bikes have come in recent years, stops it from getting a higher score.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/privateer-141-slx-xt-review/\">Read our full Privateer 141 SLX XT review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV\" title=\"Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The CC X01 RSV is Santa Cruz’s range-topping 5010.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£7,599 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Composed and fun; only 130mm of travel, but still capable</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey build</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV is the brand’s top-flight version of its 5010. The bike has an updated geometry that sees it getting lower and longer, and it now has Santa Cruz’s low-slung VPP (Virtual Pivot Point) design. It sticks to 650b wheels though and retains the fun factor of previous models.</p>\n<p>The suspension comes in the form of RockShox’ top-spec kit on the front and rear, providing 140mm/130mm of travel. Paired with the new geometry, this creates a ride that is capable and fast on descents, remaining composed but spurring you on, and is incredibly energetic on climbs when pushing power through the pedals. The handling is also razor-sharp.</p>\n<p>Fittingly for this carbon fibre bike, and its significant price tag, the finishing kit is top-tier too, with SRAM drivetrain and brakes and Santa Cruz’s own carbon Reserve rims built around DT Swiss hubs.</p>\n<p>This all comes together to create a bike that is seriously fun to ride. It’s not quite as playful as previous versions, but it is more capable and faster. And if the price is too steep, Santa Cruz offers the 5010 in less expensive builds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/santa-cruz-5010-cc-x01-rsv-review/\">Read our full Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized Stumpjumper Comp</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Specialized Stumpjumper Comp full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Specialized Stumpjumper Comp - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Specialized Stumpjumper Comp is the cheapest carbon Stumpy in the range, though there are two alloy versions available for a chunk less cash.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£3,950 / $5,000 / €5,000 / AU$7,200 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Smooth suspension and great chassis; excellent rear-end grip</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Specialized’s tyres; pricey for the build</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It may be the cheapest carbon Stumpjumper, but the Comp spec still delivers impressive performance from its 130mm-travel and flip-chip tunable geometry – the EVO version gets a little more travel and more aggressive geometry.</p>\n<p>Rear suspension is smooth and leads to great grip for the Specialized Purgatory tyre.

The components don’t have to be super-lightweight as on XC bikes, or heavy-duty enough to survive the rigours of downhill, which helps to keep costs down.</p>\n<p>Although enduro and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a> are considered to be the Formula 1 of mountain biking, we think trail bikes are the most important and widest-spanning category, and benefit from economies of scale where bigger production runs also play a factor in keeping prices down.</p>\n<p>The affordability of trail bikes combined with their versatility, helps to make them an ideal choice if you’re new to the world of mountain biking or are looking for a one-bike solution to all your mountain biking needs.</p>\n\n<h3>What to look for in a trail bike</h3>\n<p>There are no set rules when it comes to defining what a trail bike is and, like all mountain biking sub-disciplines, they exist on a sliding scale in terms of capability, geometry, suspension travel and price.</p>\n<p>However, there are various factors that when put together constitute a trail bike and are worth bearing in mind when looking for one of these versatile machines.</p>\n<h4>Frame material</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist in blue top riding the Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Santa Cruz 5010 CC X01 RSV 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aluminium is a good choice if you’re on a budget, but carbon bikes are extremely desirable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many brands stick to aluminium alloy or carbon fibre for trail bike frames, while some more boutique builders opt for alternative frame materials, such as steel or titanium.</p>\n<p>Carbon has the advantage of being lighter and stronger, and can be made to be stiffer than an equivalent aluminium frame, so it’s a good choice if zipping uphill and weight are priorities. It does, however, cost more than aluminium.</p>\n<p>While it might not have the exotic feel of carbon, or be as lightweight, an aluminium frame is a good call if you’re new to the sport or on a budget, but it’s hard to argue with the desirability and performance of carbon.</p>\n<h4>Geometry</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist in blue and grey top riding the Saracen Ariel 30 Pro full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Saracen Ariel 30 Pro 12\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Longer and slacker, many modern trail bikes are built for descending.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">Frame geometry</a> probably has the biggest impact on how a mountain bike handles, with even slight adjustments to the wheelbase, head tube angle and reach determining how a bike feels.</p>\n<p>In keeping with their Goldilocks position between XC and enduro bikes, trail bikes have a relatively slack geometry that makes them capable enough to handle most rough descents, while being suitable for all-day epics and plenty of comfortable and efficient climbing.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, trail bikes have a head tube angle of between 64 and 66.5 degrees and seat tube angle of between 73 and 78 degrees.</p>\n<p>Look for slacker head tube angles if you want a bike that will descend better, because a slacker angle helps give the bike a calmer ride by slowing down the steering. It also makes its wheelbase longer, which helps improve stability at high riding speeds.</p>\n<h4>Travel</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fox DPS Performance Elite rear shock\" title=\"Saracen Ariel 30 Pro 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trail bikes come with a variety of different suspension systems.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most commonly, trail bikes have front and rear suspension with between 120mm and 150mm of travel.</p>\n<p>As travel increases, a bike will be better suited to riding downhill and less suitable for climbing, so when considering how much travel to go for on a trail bike think about the type of terrain you’ll spend most of your time riding and your riding style.</p>\n<p>If you ride on rougher, more technical trails, or like to barrel down descents, choosing a trail bike with 140mm or 150mm is advisable.</p>\n<p>Shorter-travel bikes won’t descend quite as well, but they are light and efficient so are a good choice if endurance riding and climbing is more your thing.</p>\n<h4>Wheel size and tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Canyon Spectral 29 CF 7 full suspension mountain bike is equipped with a RockShox Pike Select RC fork\" title=\"Canyon Spectral 29 CF 7 06\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Maxxis tyres and DT Swiss wheels are common choices for off-the-shelf trail bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There used to be a time when mountain bikes simply had 26in wheels. But those days are long gone, and now mountain bikes come with either 27.5in or 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>Both wheel sizes have their <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">advantages and disadvantages</a>. 29in wheels roll over obstacles and hold their momentum more, making them the preference for cross-country and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">best downcountry mountain bikes</a>. Compared to 29in wheels, 27.5in wheels are faster accelerating, stronger and more agile, with handling and placement feeling more natural too.</p>\n<p>Trail bikes come with either of the two sizes and there isn’t really a right or wrong answer to which size wheels you should go for – you might prefer the snappier feel of 27.5in wheels or value the efficiency of 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>One thing to bear in mind when selecting what wheel size to go for is your height. A taller rider will probably benefit from a larger wheel, whereas a shorter rider will benefit from a smaller wheel. Some manufacturers do consider this and provide models with different-size wheels depending on frame size.</p>\n<p>Trail bike tyres tend to be chunkier with a decent amount of tread and are around 2.3 to 2.5in wide. These provide a decent amount of grip and help make trail bikes the versatile machines they are.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">best mountain bike tyres</a> can really change how your bike feels, so it’s worth paying attention to what tyres a trail bike is specced with, but also remember that it’s not too hard to swap tyres out for something more suitable for your riding.</p>\n<h4>Drivetrain</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Privateer 141 SLX XT full suspension mountain bike is equipped with a mixed SLX and XT groupset\" title=\"Privateer 141 SLX XT 08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You might find that trail bikes have a mix of different groupsets, such as Shimano XT and SLX.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Trail bikes tend to have drivetrains with one front chainring. Thanks to wide-ranging 12-speed cassettes (normally between 10 to 52t), only having one front chainring doesn’t limit climbing potential.</p>\n<p>Groupsets such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/shimano-deore-xt-m8100-review/\">Shimano Deore XT M8100</a> are a popular choice on trail bikes. Trail bikes also tend to have easier gearing than speed-focused XC bikes. Front rings are usually between 30- and 34-tooth, while rear cassettes can go up to 52-tooth.</p>\n<p>This gives trail bikes a wide range of gears for enough speed on the flat and to help you get up tough climbs.</p>\n<h4>Brakes</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano Deore 4-pot disc brakes with 180mm rotors\" title=\"Saracen Ariel 30 Pro 08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some trail bikes come with four-piston brakes to provide a load of stopping power.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like most aspects of trail bikes, the brakes strike a balance between stopping power and weight saving.</p>\n<p>Trail bikes will generally come with disc brakes that have two- or four-piston calipers. Four-piston brakes are more powerful and are aimed at downhill riding, where more braking power is needed, but this will of course add weight.</p>\n<p>Rotors on trail bikes are often a mix, with up to 200mm both front and back. The larger the disc rotor, the more powerful the brakes will be, but this also comes with a weight penalty.</p>\n<p>Hydraulic brakes are standard on all full-suspension trail bikes costing £1,000 or above, and often the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\">best mountain bikes under £1,000</a> come with these brakes too.</p>\n<h4>Handlebar</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Kona Process\" title=\"Kona Process\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A wide bar gives extra control and stability, making for easier descending.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Wide mountain bike handlebars are becoming the norm, and provide extra stability, comfort and control.</p>\n<p>Trail bikes follow this trend, many coming with a 760mm or 780mm bar, while some go up to 800mm. Just as smaller-sized trail bikes tend to have smaller 27.5in wheels, they also come with a narrower bar, going down 740mm, to help make the bike a better fit for smaller riders</p>\n<h4>Dropper posts</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"YT Postman seatpost and SDG RADAR MTN saddle\" title=\"YT Jeffsy Blaze 07\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Versatility at the flick of a switch.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">Dropper posts</a> are almost standard on trail bikes.</p>\n<p>They allow you to lower and raise your saddle with the flick of a handlebar-mounted button, giving you extra room to move your weight around on descents and the correct saddle height for efficient pedalling.</p>\n<p>A dropper post is one of the first upgrades you should consider if your trail bike doesn’t have one, because it will open the bike up to a wider range of riding.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0942f23599f59b8c355ae0477123647a2fd3d7cb3005d024d6a99cef2109613e","category":"Cycling"}
