For the most part, users have been impressed with the hardware and the technology introduced by the Vision Pro, but there are questions about the actual function of the device, the intuitiveness of the gesture-based control, the weight and comfort, and VR in general. Users have also been critical of the lack of content for the device. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"The Vision Pro's success, regardless of its price, will ultimately depend on the available content,\" said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president at IDC. \"As Apple expands the product to international markets, it's crucial that local content is also made available.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to produce fewer than 400,000 Vision Pro headsets in 2024 due to the complexity of manufacturing, according to analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. However, Apple is said to be already working on a new version of the ‌‌Apple Vision Pro‌‌ for 2025 that will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/gurman-apple-vision-pro-2-at-least-18-months-away/\">priced more affordably</a>. IDC's Jeronimo predicts that will more than double sales when it arrives in the latter half of 2025.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/\">Apple Vision Pro Unlikely to Hit 500,000 Sales This Year, Says IDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-unlikely-to-hit-500-000-sales-this-year-says-idc.2431121/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88431198f8a043754eb878633b0ef261da6cafa28506253d983b029e9f840f9d","category":"Apple"}
