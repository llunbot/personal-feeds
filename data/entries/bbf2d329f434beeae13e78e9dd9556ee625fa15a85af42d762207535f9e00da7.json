{"title":"European Commission Charges X With Breach of DSA","link":"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_3761","date":1720805028000,"content":"\n<p>I guess the European Commission hasn’t taken off for their months-long summer vacation quite yet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he Commission has issued preliminary findings of non-compliance\n   on three grievances:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, X designs and operates its interface for the “verified\naccounts” with the “Blue checkmark” in a way that does not\ncorrespond to industry practice and <em>deceives users. Since\nanyone can subscribe to obtain such a “verified” status</em>, it\nnegatively affects users’ ability to make free and informed\ndecisions about the authenticity of the accounts and the content\nthey interact with. There is evidence of motivated malicious\nactors abusing the “verified account” to deceive users.</p></li>\n<li><p>Second, X does not comply with the <em>required transparency on\nadvertising</em>, as it does not provide a searchable and reliable\nadvertisement repository, but instead put in place design\nfeatures and access barriers that make the repository unfit for\nits transparency purpose towards users. In particular, the\ndesign does not allow for the required supervision and research\ninto emerging risks brought about by the distribution of\nadvertising online.</p></li>\n<li><p>Third, X fails to <em>provide access to its public data to\nresearchers</em> in line with the conditions set out in the DSA. In\nparticular, X prohibits eligible researchers from <em>independently\naccessing</em> its public data, such as by scraping, as stated in\nits terms of service. In addition, X’s process to <em>grant\neligible researchers access to its application programming\ninterface (API)</em> appears to dissuade researchers from carrying\nout their research projects or leave them with no other choice\nthan to pay disproportionally high fees.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t really have an opinion on the second and third points, but the first one seems daft to me. Here’s how commissioner Thierry Breton is quoted in the EC’s press release:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Back in the day, BlueChecks used to mean trustworthy sources of\ninformation. Now with X, our preliminary view is that they deceive\nusers and infringe the DSA. We also consider that X’s ads\nrepository and conditions for data access by researchers are not\nin line with the DSA transparency requirements. X has now the\nright of defence — but if our view is confirmed we will impose\nfines and require significant changes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Blue checkmarks were indeed used, “back in the day”, to indicate “verified” accounts. But upon purchasing Twitter, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23690079/twitter-legacy-verification-ending-on-420\">Elon Musk eliminated that program</a>. They don’t advertise it as “Verified” any more; <a href=\"https://help.x.com/en/using-x/x-premium\">they just call it “Twitter Premium”</a> and make it very clear that blue checkmarks indicate premium account status. That’s illegal under the DSA?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1811766597620474350\">here’s Elon Musk</a>, replying to Breton’s announcement of this investigation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How we know you’re real? 🧐</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We look forward to a very public battle in court, so that the\npeople of Europe can know the truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And, more intriguingly, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1811783320839008381\">replying to Margrethe Vestager</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The European Commission offered X an illegal secret deal: if we\nquietly censored speech without telling anyone, they would not\nfine us.</p>\n\n<p>The other platforms accepted that deal.</p>\n\n<p>X did not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The weapon the EC wields is their ability to fine companies 10–20 percent of global revenue. Musk is in a unique position to tell them to fuck off. Twitter’s revenue peaked at $5 billion in 2021 — when the company was still publicly-held — and has surely declined since then. A $500 million fine is figuratively nothing to Musk. He’d gladly pay that just for the attention a public fight over this will bring to him personally and X as a platform.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/12/ec-x-dsa\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bbf2d329f434beeae13e78e9dd9556ee625fa15a85af42d762207535f9e00da7","category":"Tech"}
