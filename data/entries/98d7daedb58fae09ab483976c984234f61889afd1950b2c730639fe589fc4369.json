What that means is that your local Yamaha dealer shop in the US will be selling out whatever inventory of ebikes they have in stock – at heavily discounted prices, no less. But there won’t be any more new ebikes coming in. Yamaha USA does say they’ll still honor their extra-long warranties. But it seems the ‘ebikes in motorcycle shops’ business model just wasn’t cutting it in the US. We’ll have to wait and see what this means on a more global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yamaha withdraws from the US retail ebike market</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Yamaha YDX Moro 07, 30th-anniversary ebike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos by MirrorMedia BCA/Yamaha)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend we started hearing that Yamaha Motor Corporation USA – the American parent brand behind everything from Yamaha motorcycles, ATVs, golf carts, boat motors to Yamaha Power Assist Bicycles (<em>aka ebikes</em>) – has been informing their dealers that they are getting out of selling their own ebikes. Reddit’s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Yamahaebikes/comments/1ghecps/yamaha_pulling_out_of_ebikes_us_market/\">r/Yamahaebikes</a> shared an official letter sent out to dealer shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Yamaha YDX Moro 07, 30th-anniversary ebike headtube logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-headtube-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, after 6 years of selling ebikes through some motorcycle and some independent bike shops, including the boom &amp; a post-COVID bust in ebike sales, the numbers just weren’t adding up. It seems Yamaha just couldn’t compete with mix of low-cost online direct sales or more established high-end eMTB sales through traditional bikeshops. So, they’re putting a stop to dealer ebike sales in the US once the current 60%-off, cashback &amp; extended 5-year warranty of their ‘Fan Promotion’ sales clear out all the US ebike inventory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yamaha USA also assures that they’ll keep providing spare parts, service &amp; customer service support flowing to keep everyone who’s bought a Yamaha ebike pedaling through their full 5-year warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Possible global &amp; OEM impacts?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Yamaha YDX Moro 07, 30th-anniversary ebike motor detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yamaha-YDX-Moro-07_30th-anniversary-ebike_photo-by-MirrorMedia-Bike-Connection-Agency_eMTB-motor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as to the broader impacts of this pull-out, we know a bit less. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we expect a similar fate to impact Yamaha ebikes in motorcycle shops more globally? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve asked both our US &amp; European Yamaha ebike contacts. And so far have only heard back from the Americans who couldn’t speak to broader impacts, but could only reiterate that “<em>current customers can rest assured that Yamaha will continue with parts and warranty service</em>” to keep their ebikes going.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/br-ebike-yamaha-2-jpg.webp\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/br-ebike-yamaha-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"the yamaha PW-X3 drive\" /></a><figcaption>The Yamaha PW-X3 drive. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the same ‘ebike vs. moto vs. bike dealer’ argument could be a bigger issue globally. We’d guess that, is unlikely to have any further-reaching direct impact on Yamaha ebike Systems themselves. Yamaha has been manufacturing ebike motors since 1993. They celebrated their 30th anniversary of Power Assist System ebike motors with a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yamaha-bicycles-special-edition-dx-moro-07/\" target=\"_blank\">special edition YDX Moro 0</a>7 last year. And we still see them in the broader OEM ebike motor market as competition to the likes of Bosch and Shimano. It’s true that we see fewer ebike brands directly spec’ing Yamaha motors as we did in the recent past from BH, Ghost, Lapierre &amp; more. But Giant &amp; Liv still prominently use Yamaha SyncDrive motors in their premium eMTBs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h4><em>Full text of Yamaha letter to ebike dealers via <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Yamahaebikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a>:</em></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>YAMAHA MOTOR CORPORATION, U.S.A.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dear Yamaha eBike Dealer,</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We want to thank you for your partnership and for your business in purchasing and retailing Yamaha eBikes, and for proudly representing the Yamaha brand.
