The standard membership comes in at £4.49 per month. This grants you access to the highlights, expert analysis and exclusive content. The premium subscription is a £5.99 per month commitment. Premium subscribers will be able to watch the racing live on the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also year-long plans available for £39.99 and £49.99 respectively. This saves around 30% over a year’s worth of monthly membership payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>‘Help create a sustainable British pro cycling scene</strong>‘</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-1347052059-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>George Wood/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sustainability is at the core of the new Monument Cycling project. Profits from subscription fees are ‘put back into helping the British pro cycling scene’. Importantly, the service hopes that ‘athletes and staff can make a living competing here in the UK’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We fund highlights for the National Road Series entirely from our own pocket to help support riders, teams, and organisers to build a sustainable racing scene in the UK,’ the Monument Cycling website describes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important element to this new phase of domestic racing. The British scene has long been marred by tight wallets and turbulent team timelines. Riders at this level face great difficulties in making cycling a full-time living. With fewer British teams at the UCI ProTeam level since the beginning of the 2010s, sustainability and financial aid will be a big step towards making the domestic scene a more prosperous platform for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully committed to sustainability and sporting inclusivity, Monument Cycling will also organise their own race, the Cambridge Criterium, this August Bank Holiday weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A game changer for British racing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"544\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/guildford-race-970x544.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/guildford-race-970x544.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/guildford-race-300x168.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/guildford-race-768x431.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/guildford-race-750x421.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/guildford-race-1140x640.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/guildford-race.png 1531w\" /><figcaption>Charlotteville Cycling Club</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the pandemic, the domestic scene in the UK has struggled to return to full speed. A decade ago, a healthy calendar of local races and criteriums allowed British teams a chance to race almost every week at the national level. These races were sometimes broadcast onto free-to-air TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the pandemic, however, the sport has suffered large financial cutbacks. The racing calendar has been gutted, and the race broadcasts took a more amateur approach through in-house streaming on YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The domestic scene has been crying out for an existential re-think. The blue-sky thinking behind Monument Cycling TV could be the electric shock needed to help the British scene return to its former glory days.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/monument-cycling-tv-announcement\">Monument Cycling TV launches new streaming service for ‘the best of British bike racing’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6af947f1e2f96a28f14fc3fe0dd4c091a5e6886c6dc08ceae621566e3aa1f0ff","category":"Cycling"}
