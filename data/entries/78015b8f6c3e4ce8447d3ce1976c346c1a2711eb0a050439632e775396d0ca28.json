Run!\" (credit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342\">Microsoft</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Longtime gamers (and/or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/gamegrumps\">Game Grumps fans</a>) likely know that even single-player games can be a lot more fun with a friend hanging out nearby to offer advice, shoot the breeze, or just offer earnest reactions to whatever's happening on screen. Now, Microsoft is promising that its GhatGPT-4o-powered Copilot system will soon offer an imitation of that pro-social experience even for <em>Minecraft</em> players who don't have any human friends available to watch them play.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792625882634281231\">pair</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342\">social media posts</a> Monday, Microsoft highlighted how \"real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot\" can enhance an otherwise solitary <em>Minecraft</em> experience. In the first demo, the disembodied copilot voice tells the player how to craft a sword, walking him through the process of gathering some wood or stone to go with the sticks sitting in his inventory. In another, the AI identifies a zombie in front of the player and gives the (seemingly obvious) advice to run away from the threat and \"make sure it can't reach you\" by digging underground or building a tower of blocks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Real time conversations with your AI companion Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o. <a href=\"https://t.co/Ug7EWv2sah\">pic.twitter.com/Ug7EWv2sah</a></p>\n<p>— Microsoft Copilot (@MSFTCopilot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>These kinds of in-game pointers aren't the most revolutionary use of conversational AI—even a basic in-game tutorial/reference system or online walkthrough could deliver the same basic information, after all. Still, the demonstration stands out for just <em>how</em> that information is delivered to the player through a natural language conversation that doesn't require pausing the gameplay even briefly.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025917#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025917&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78015b8f6c3e4ce8447d3ce1976c346c1a2711eb0a050439632e775396d0ca28","category":"Tech"}
