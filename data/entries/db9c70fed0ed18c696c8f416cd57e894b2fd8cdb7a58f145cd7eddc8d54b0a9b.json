The Link Wrench was laser cut and etched prior, which resulted in slag-covered products and tolerances not as tight as Forager would like. Now, the Link Wrench is CNC milled in-house, from Grade 5 titanium, which allows for even tighter tolerances (your old Link Wrench is still just fine, weâ€™re talking machinist OCD here with tolerances!)</p>\n<p>These wrenches are super handy for tightening 8, 9, or 10 mm nuts down on the trail. Be it fenders, racks, faux-racks/bag supports, and the Dyneema chord can be used as a chain Masterlink tool, even!</p>\n<p>Check out the new CNC milled Link Wrench at <a href=\"https://foragercycles.com/products/the-link-wrench\" target=\"_blank\">Forager Cycles</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/forager-cycles-link-wrenches-are-now-cnc-milled-in-house/\">Forager Cycles Link Wrenches are Now CNC Milled in House</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"db9c70fed0ed18c696c8f416cd57e894b2fd8cdb7a58f145cd7eddc8d54b0a9b","category":"Cycling"}
