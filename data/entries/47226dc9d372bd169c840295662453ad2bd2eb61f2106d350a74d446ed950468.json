Transactions are encrypted and Apple does not have information about what is purchased or the person that made the purchase.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the customer end, using Tap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌ works like any standard ‌Apple Pay‌ transaction. Sellers open up an app on an ‌iPhone‌ XS or later, register a sale, and present an ‌iPhone‌ to the buyer, who can then use a contactless payment method to complete the transaction.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdyen, ANZ Bank, Stripe, Windcave, and Worldline offer Tap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌ in New Zealand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌ launched in February 2022 in the United States, and since then, Apple has been working to expand it to additional countries. The feature is available in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/new-zealand/\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/\">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-new-zealand/\">Tap to Pay on iPhone Now Available in New Zealand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-now-available-in-new-zealand.2443751/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"47226dc9d372bd169c840295662453ad2bd2eb61f2106d350a74d446ed950468","category":"Apple"}
