It’s unclear whether actual Core and Core Ultra systems will be available to buy on that date, but at a bare minimum, the official announcement will pave the way to many laptop announcements at CES in January.</p>\n\n<p>We already know a lot of basic facts about Meteor Lake; it uses a combination of chiplets manufactured by both Intel and TSMC rather than a single monolithic die, and it will mark <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/next-gen-core-and-core-ultra-cpus-lose-an-i-as-intel-shuffles-its-branding/2/\">the retirement</a> of Intel’s “nth-generation” and i3/i5/i7/i9 branding. We also know that it won’t be ready for desktops and that the next round of Core desktop CPUs will be very similar to the 12th- and 13th-generation chips.</p>\n<p>But at Intel's Innovation event this week, the company dove a little deeper into some of Meteor Lake’s advancements, describing more about how the chips would balance E-cores and P-cores and announcing its most substantial integrated GPU upgrade in years. We’ll hit some highlights below, though it’s worth <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/2023-intel-innovation-day-1-livestream-replay.html#gs.5yzg2v\">watching</a> or <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/2023-intel-innovation-day-1-liveblog.html#gs.5yzcm1\">reading</a> the full presentation to find out more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969537#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969537&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"561435bf7f7c825644b8b620ed71c43f209d7a5ea9632ed79101ea4e0d13f8c8","category":"Tech"}
