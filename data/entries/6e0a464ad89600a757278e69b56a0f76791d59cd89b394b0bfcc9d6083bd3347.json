At the time, the treatment was experimental, but it worked: The cells targeted the cancer and eradicated it. Thirteen years later, Whitehead is still cancer-free.</p>\n<p>The modified cells, called <a href=\"https://undark.org/2019/10/23/cart-t-behind-scenes-cancer-cure/\">CAR-T cells</a>, are a form of immunotherapy, where doctors change parts of the immune system into cancer-attacking instruments. About five years after Whitehead’s <a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/news/emily-whitehead-first-pediatric-patient-receive-car-t-cell-therapy-celebrates-cure-10-years\">treatment</a>, the first CAR-T drugs were approved by the FDA and were heralded, along with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0488-6\">immunotherapy</a> more broadly, as one of the most promising modern cancer treatments. Today, there are seven FDA-approved CAR-T therapies, including the one used to treat Whitehead.</p>\n<p>Since then, however, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03084-6\">studies</a> have linked CAR-T to fatal complications due to treatment toxicity, and the treatment has had a harder time addressing certain types of cancers, particularly solid tumors affecting the breast and pancreas, although some small clinical trials have been <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cells#closing-in-on-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors\">starting to show</a> positive results for solid cancers. “After a decade, a decade and a half, we arrive at the point that there are patients who answer, most of the patients still do not answer,” said George Calin, a researcher at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-new-era-in-cancer-therapies-is-at-hand/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-new-era-in-cancer-therapies-is-at-hand/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Claudia López Lloreda, Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6e0a464ad89600a757278e69b56a0f76791d59cd89b394b0bfcc9d6083bd3347","category":"Tech"}
