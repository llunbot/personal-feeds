Variations of the Transformer architecture power language models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/\">GPT-4o</a> (and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a>), audio synthesis models that run Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/\">NotebookLM</a> and OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/when-counting-quickly-openais-new-voice-mode-stops-to-catch-its-breath/\">Advanced Voice Mode</a>, video synthesis models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/\">Sora</a>, and image synthesis models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-crazy-update-midjourney-v6-upgrade-heaps-on-ai-generated-detail/\">Midjourney</a>.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/at-ted-ai-2024-experts-grapple-with-ais-growing-pains/\">TED AI 2024</a> in October, one of those eight researchers, Jakob Uszkoreit, spoke with Ars Technica about the development of transformers, Google's early work on large language models, and his <a href=\"https://inceptive.life/\">new venture</a> in biological computing.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f7d9c20cd105a364c66bc28ec8fa606eaa1a41b8abba90ed86528711d4b7df67","category":"Tech"}
