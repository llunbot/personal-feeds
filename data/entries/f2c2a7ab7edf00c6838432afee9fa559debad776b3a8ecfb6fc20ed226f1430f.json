The new version of ‌Siri‌ apparently touts natural conversation capabilities, as well as increased user personalization.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new features are believed to be available across devices, suggesting that the new version of ‌Siri‌ will retain conversation information from one device to another. It is also said to feature a new \"Apple-specific creational service,\" which might relate to the previously reported Siri-based <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/\">Shortcuts capabilities</a> rumored for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is purportedly working on linkages for the new version of ‌Siri‌ to connect to various external services, likely via an API. Finally, the report suggests that some of Apple's new AI features may differ based on subscription service status, but it is unclear what shape this could take.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA recent forecast from Deepwater Asset Management <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year/\">similarly claimed</a> that Apple will bring generative AI to ‌Siri‌ this year. The Naver blog account has a mixed track record for forecasting Apple's plans, but some of its claims have proven to be significant. For example, in March 2022 it accurately revealed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/iphone-se-rumor-magsafe-battery-life/\">some details</a> about the third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> ahead of Apple launching the model. In October of the same year it also accurately predicted that Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/30/14-16-macbook-pro-next-year/\">delay the release</a> of new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models until early 2023.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/\">Naver</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/\">Apple GPT</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/new-version-of-siri-with-generative-ai/\">New Version of Siri With Generative AI Again Rumored for WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-version-of-siri-with-generative-ai-again-rumored-for-wwdc.2415432/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f2c2a7ab7edf00c6838432afee9fa559debad776b3a8ecfb6fc20ed226f1430f","category":"Apple"}
