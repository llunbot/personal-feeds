While many aero wheels target maximum aerodynamic efficiency, Hunt realizes that aero gravel race wheels must strike a compromise of lightweight, aero efficiency, and versatility. So they set out to design the most aero mid-depth carbon wheelset they could while riding 40mm or 45mm tires over rough off-road tracks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_rims-sections-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_rims-sections-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero optimized off-road racing wheels, fronr- &amp; rear-specific rim sections\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_rims-sections-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_rims-sections-297x158.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_rims-sections-120x64.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_rims-sections-768x410.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their result is a two-pronged approach – a slightly shorter, wider &amp; heavier front wheel to cut into undisturbed airflow and an incrementally taller, narrower &amp; more robust rear wheel to follow behind in turbulent air but supporting more of the rider+bike weight. Both front &amp; rear are now hookless with straighter sides, with wider 4.5mm tubeless-ready beads that are more resistant to pinch flatting due to the larger radius of their edges that spread out forces, even when you bottom-out against a sharp edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Erica-Hinck_carbon-spoke-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Erica-Hinck_carbon-spoke-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero optimized off-road racing wheels, carbon spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Erica-Hinck_carbon-spoke-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Erica-Hinck_carbon-spoke-detail-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Erica-Hinck_carbon-spoke-detail-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Erica-Hinck_carbon-spoke-detail-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Erica-Hinck_carbon-spoke-detail-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their ultimate goal was to best their already “<em>class-leading aerodynamic performance of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hunts-aero-42-limitless-gravel-wheels-are-faster-in-the-wind-tunnel-but-also-off-road/\" target=\"_blank\">42 Limitless Gravel Aero</a></em>” wheels while substantially reducing weight.

But Hunt-sponsored gravel racers demanded lighter wheels to offset the weight of the wide tires they were racing. And that rotating weight was very tangibly felt over long races, with each acceleration, whether out of corners, to close a gap, or just after navigating some technical section. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero optimized off-road racing wheels, dirty race wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_photo-by-Dominique-Powers_after-a-dusty-Unbound-Race-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, Hunt take it another step further. Just like in their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hunt-sub50-limitless-aero-road-wheels-reset-lighter-faster-all-rounder-benchmark/\" target=\"_blank\">Sub50 Limitless</a> aero road wheels, Hunt realized that front- &amp; rear-specific designs could help them increase aerodynamic efficiency while shedding substantial weight. And of course, the Sub50s reinforce the benefits of carbon spokes. The shift to Hunt’s top-tier TaperLock full UD Carbon spokes saved a bunch of weight, but so did that carbon layup refinement in the rims, and lighter hubs, too. Even the steel spoke wheelsets are more than 110g lighter than the previous generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, those carbon spokes “offer 6% greater lateral responsiveness compared to steel spoke equivalents with significantly less weight (2.7g per spoke), allowing the design team to reduce the number of spokes used in the system”. Hunt’s TaperLock carbon spokes still retain conventional nipples, so the wheels are still easy to true and service. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero optimized off-road racing wheels, rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-optimized-off-road-racing-wheels_carbon-spokes-and-alloy-nipples-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>40 Limitless Gravel Aero Disc UD Carbon Spoke:</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>front- &amp;
