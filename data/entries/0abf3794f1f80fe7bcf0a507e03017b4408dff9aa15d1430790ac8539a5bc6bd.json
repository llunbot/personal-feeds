Preliminary support for that kind of translation will be coming to CodeWeavers' CrossOver software this summer, the company<a href=\"https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2023/6/1/unleashing-the-gaming-revolution-crossover-macs-directx-12-support-update\"> announced in a blog post</a> late last week.</p>\n<p>CrossOver is a software package that promises to run Windows apps and games under macOS and Linux without requiring a full virtualized (or emulated) Windows installation. Its developers announced that they were <a href=\"https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/cjsilver/2021/12/22/were-getting-there-crossover-support-for-directx-12\">working on DirectX 12 support</a> in late 2021, and now they have a sample screenshot of <em>Diablo II Resurrected</em> running on an Apple M2 chip. This early DirectX12 support will ship with CrossOver version 23 \"later this summer.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944395#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944395&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0abf3794f1f80fe7bcf0a507e03017b4408dff9aa15d1430790ac8539a5bc6bd","category":"Tech"}
