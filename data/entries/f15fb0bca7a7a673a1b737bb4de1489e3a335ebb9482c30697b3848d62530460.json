{"title":"It's 2009 Again: Apple is Apparently Considering Making a TV","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/17/apple-evaluating-a-tv-set-report/","date":1731850059000,"content":"Between around 2009 and 2011, it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2009/08/20/apple-tv-set-by-2011/\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2011/08/28/multiple-sources-suggest-apple-working-on-television-for-as-early-as-2012/\">rumored</a> that Apple would be releasing a TV, but that obviously never happened. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-TV-4K-hero-221018-feature.jpg\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nNow, a decade-and-a-half later, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says the idea is back on the table.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-17/how-will-president-donald-trump-s-new-tariffs-affect-apple-products-and-prices-m3lnfx64\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman briefly mentioned that Apple has been \"evaluating\" the \"idea of making an Apple-branded TV set.\" He did not provide any further details about the TV, but he said it could be one of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-smart-home-products/\">several new smart home devices</a> that Apple releases if its rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/\">wall-mounted smart home hub</a> is successful.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt sounds like Apple is still in the very early stages of considering a TV, so it is likely years away from launching, if it ever comes to fruition. Nevertheless, it reignites the exciting possibility of Apple competing in the TV-set industry in a more direct way. Currently, the company only sells the Apple TV box that connects to a TV for streaming.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt remains to be seen how Apple would compete with other TV brands in terms of display specifications, features, and pricing. A wide range of TV sets from brands like LG, Samsung, and Vizio already offer AirPlay, HomeKit, and Apple TV+, but an Apple-branded TV could have even deeper integration with the Apple ecosystem of devices. Apple's TV would almost certainly offer a very premium design as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe TV-set industry is known to be very competitive with low profit margins, but perhaps Apple could release a high-end TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSteve Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson that he <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/21/steve-jobs-on-an-apple-television-set-i-finally-cracked-it/\">planned to reinvent the TV</a> before he sadly passed away, saying that he had \"finally cracked it.\" He added that it would have had \"the simplest user interface you could imagine.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2010, however, Apple's then-COO, now-CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2010/02/23/apple-coo-tim-cook-speaks-at-goldman-sachs-conference/\">said</a> the company had \"no interest in being in the TV market.\" Of course, it has been a long time since he made that comment, and things can always change.
