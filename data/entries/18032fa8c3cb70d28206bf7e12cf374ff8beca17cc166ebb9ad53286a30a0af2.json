The Archer Midnight eVTOL aircraft will complete the route in about 10 minutes; according to local resident and Ars Managing Editor Eric Bangeman, that journey by car can take over an hour due to road construction.</p>\n<p>\"Both Archer and United are committed to decarbonizing air travel and leveraging innovative technologies to deliver on the promise of the electrification of the aviation industry,\" said Michael Leskinen, president of United Airlines Ventures. \"Once operational, we're excited to offer our customers a more sustainable, convenient, and cost-effective mode of transportation during their commutes to the airport.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/united-airlines-orders-200-vertical-takeoff-electric-airplanes/\">United placed an order for 200 eVTOL aircraft from Archer</a> back in 2021 at a cost of $1 billion.
