To help prospective owners and participants in the next <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-brompton-world-championships-racing-with-style\" target=\"_blank\">Brompton World Championships</a> navigate the range of options available, this guide explains all of the Brompton folding bike’s main features and the range currently on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based around a robust steel frame in standard form and rolling on diminutive 16-inch wheels, a Brompton can be folded into a package measuring 585mm × 565mm × 270mm in under 10 seconds. It is, as its inventor intended, like having a magic carpet you can unfurl anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite tweaks and upgrades over the years, including electric models, all Bromptons follow a similar pattern to the bike as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/welcome-to-the-fold-behind-the-scenes-at-brompton\" target=\"_blank\">created by founder Andrew Ritchie back in 1975</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now there’s also the 20-inch wheel <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/brompton-g-line\" target=\"_blank\">Brompton G Line</a>. It folds in the same way and looks the same, but it’s larger, has disc brakes and can come with tyres for off-road riding. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Brompton folding bikes: The range explained</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/02211632/brompton_my21_london_gm_26-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"brompton_my21_london_gm_26\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All Bromptons fit into one of the brand’s five lines: A Line, C Line, T Line, P Line and G Line, with the C Line, P Line and G Line all offering electric versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>A Line</strong> is Brompton’s most basic model: a sturdy 3-speed folding bike which has a one-size-fits all concept </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>C Line </strong>range offers more options, and comes in a 2-speed, 3-speed or 6-speed as well as a range of different seatposts, saddles and handlebars </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong><strong>Electric</strong><span> </span>C Line </strong>is what it says on the tin and comes in a 2-speed or 6-speed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>P Line</strong> is a lightweight titanium and steel 4-speed Brompton which comes with or without a roller frame </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Electric P Line</strong> is the electric version of the P Line and Brompton’s lightest electric bike </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>T Line</strong> is Brompton’s lightest bike, made from titanium and offered in a 1-speed and 4-speed </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>G Line</strong> is Brompton’s 20-inch wheel, 8-speed option, with or without a roller frame </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Electric G Line</strong> adds a motor to the 20-inch wheel G Line, as well as a roller frame and 4-speed drive</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brompton’s renewed Bikes </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/brompton-g-line\">G is for Gravel?

The battery is also removable and features a useful USB port for charging your devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While electrical assistance and titanium might be this bike’s headline selling points, the four-speed gearing is also worth mentioning. External rather than hub-based, it’s lighter and quicker to shift. And although you won’t be able to change gear while stationary, its sportier performance will better suit more athletic riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all the other models, the Electric P Line is also available with a roller frame at a weight of 15.9kg for the Urban and around 16.9kg for the Explore. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/brompton-electric-p-line\" target=\"_blank\">Brompton Electric P Line preview</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3><span>Brompton T Line</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223129/brompton-t-line-1-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"brompton-t-line-1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>From £4,250 <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VOUvHJ\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/brompton-titanium\">The lightest Brompton ever</a>, the T Line weighs in at just 7.45kg for the One model, 7.95kg for the Urban model or 8.8kg for the Explore model.

The bike is equipped with new, wider handlebars and pedals and the tyres are wider too, with an option for either 54mm gravel tyres or 50mm slick road tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get the full details on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/brompton-g-line\" target=\"_blank\">Brompton G Line</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read about <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/brompton-g-line-development\" target=\"_blank\">how Brompton developed the G Line</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brompton Electric G Line</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Brompton Electric G Line\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Brompton-Electric-G-Line.jpg 1058w\" /><figcaption>Brompton </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>From £3,499 <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brompton.com%2Fp%2F1346%2Felectric-g-line-with-roller-frame-4-speed\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Electric G Line has the look of Brompton’s other electric bikes, but it’s been re-engineered with a new rear hub motor and new battery in the front-mounted battery pack. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Electric G Line four-speed weighs 16.1kg</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Electric G Line is equipped with a roller frame and has four speed gearing.

It’s suited to smaller riders or average size users after a more aggressive position. If you like a racier position on the bike and aren’t massively tall this is the one to go for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Mid</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The classic option. Not too upright, not too aggressive. Generally good for leisure riding or sedate commuting, it offers a more upright position for short riders or a more aggressive one for taller people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>High</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The high bar provides the straight-back riding style found on traditional Dutch bikes. The go-to option for most very tall riders, anyone of medium height will find it easy on the neck and shoulders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brompton seatposts</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/02212017/brompton_my21_london_gm_61-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"brompton_my21_london_gm_61\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All Bromptons now come fitted with a standard seatpost apart from the G Line, which comes in small, medium and large sizing with appropriate seatposts. For the rest of the range you can buy other seatposts as an accessory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Standard</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard seatpost is for riders with an inside leg of 84cm/33in. It allows riders to get the saddle down as low as possible when folded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Extended</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The extended seatpost should suit riders with a maximum inside leg of 89cm/35in so is for those just a bit taller than the standard seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Telescopic</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Aimed at taller riders with an inside leg of 89-99cm/35in-39in, the telescopic seatpost is for those with the longest of legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Carbon</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbon seatpost is available as both a standard and an extended option. Brompton claims a weight from 0.3kg, shedding over 100g from the standard steel option and 700g from the extended steel seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brompton saddles</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/02212022/brompton_my22_00026-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"brompton_my22_00026\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Brompton saddle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A standard feature for the A Line, the Brompton saddle comes in at 147mm and with an integrated carry handle. It also incorporates a mount for a Brompton rear light and saddle bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Brompton wide saddle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The wide version of the Brompton saddle boasts a larger seated area for added comfort and support (167mm). Like its narrower counterpart it comes with an integrated carry handle and incorporates a mount for a Brompton rear light and saddle bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Brooks B17</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The B17 is made from thick leather and includes copper-pleated rails and hammered-copper rivets. It is Brooks’ flagship model and Brompton says it is ideal for log distance sports touring, trekking and ATB use. It’s available in both male and female versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes in both male and female specific versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Superlight </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The P and T Line bikes come with Superlight and Superlight Carbon saddles, which weigh 280g and 100g respectively, and the Superlight Carbon has a grippy texture on the underside to make it even easier to carry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brompton lights</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/02212025/brompton_my22_00056-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"brompton_my22_00056\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Battery lights</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Brompton offers a range of conventional lights. These are either made by Busch &amp; Müller or created by Brompton to fit directly onto the bike’s rear rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>USB lights</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Bromptons come with USB-rechargeable front lights made by CatEye (shown above) that can be easily removed from their mount above the front wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Dynamo</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This system uses a high-quality Shutter Products SV-8 hub dynamo to offer a reliable fixed lighting solution. This means you’re never at risk of a flat battery, though cost, weight and the efficiency of modern battery lights count against it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span>Brompton tyres</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/schwalbe-marathon-racer-tanwall-tyre-folding-q102598-873x970.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Bromptons come with Schwalbe Marathon Racer tyres – a good thing too as we feel these offer the ideal balance of protection and ride feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Brompton A Line uses 349 × 35c puncture resistant Schwalbe Marathon Race tyres which have a reflective sidewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some riders like fitting lighter and narrower Schwalbe Kojaks. However, given the work such a diminutive tyre has to do, we prefer something more durable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another alternative is to go the opposite way and fit puncture-resistant Schwalbe Marathon Plus tyres. In our experience, these are a pig to get on, which combined with their increased weight means we aren’t fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continental Urban Contact tyres come with the lighter models as they save weight through a Kevlar bead and they also add grip in varying conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The G Line comes fitted with 20-inch tubeless-ready Schwalbe G-One All Round 54mm width tyres and you can also buy it with 50mm Continental slick tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brompton luggage</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/02212028/brompton_luggage-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"brompton_luggage\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The best place to carry weight on the Brompton is via its front carrying block, which is attached directly to the head tube. Once here it won’t adversely affect the steering, and if anything actually makes the bike more stable to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brompton now makes a huge range of different panniers, while brands like Carradice, Ortlieb and even the Cambridge Satchel Company also produce options.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find a variety of Brompton luggage available at </strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fcollections%2Fbrompton-bags\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Condor Cycles</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brompton special editions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-970x648.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-970x648.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-750x501.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/brompton.jpeg 1080w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Brompton produces regular special editions with limited runs and custom paint jobs.
