It's also set up to show which apps have contacted other domains and how recently they've contacted them so you can keep an eye on what apps are doing behind the scenes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApp Privacy Report is available by opening up the Settings app, selecting the Privacy section, and choosing App Privacy Report. From there, you can toggle it on. After you use apps for some time, data will begin showing up in this spot.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe beta adds updates to the Emergency SOS Auto Call feature. You can now press the side button rapidly multiple times to initiate, or hold down the side button and the volume button together. There's a longer eight-second countdown before a call is placed, which is up from the prior three-second countdown.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the second beta, Apple introduced an updated version of Apple's Messages <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/\">Communication Safety feature</a> for kids, and it adds a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-legacy-contact/\">Legacy Contacts option</a> that lets you set a person who can access your Apple content like photos in the event of your death.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also added a new \"Items That Can Track Me\" option in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> app for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/\">scanning for nearby items</a>, and the TV app on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> has a new sidebar to make navigation simpler. In the Mail app, there's also a new option to use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/macos-monterey-12-1-beta-2-hide-my-email/\">Hide My Email feature</a> when composing or replying to an email.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor a full list of features that have been added with each beta, we have dedicated guides for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/everything-new-ios-15-2/\">the initial beta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-beta-2-features/\">the second beta</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/apple-seeds-ios-15-2-public-beta-2/\">Apple Seeds Second Public Betas of iOS and iPadOS 15.2 With Legacy Contacts, Find My Updates and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-public-betas-of-ios-and-ipados-15-2-with-legacy-contacts-find-my-updates-and-more.2322779/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HNh4T-yruro:1S1iwR6b8Wo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HNh4T-yruro:1S1iwR6b8Wo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HNh4T-yruro\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8509a7d39026fa3bf4a1095e21153f0dda5044ec8cecbfdc7f782548f1596938","category":"Apple"}
