Interestingly, Apple is offering double the gift card value specifically for purchases of the 27-inch ‌iMac‌ compared to other Mac models part of the promotion. Amid rumors of an imminent update early next year, Apple may be looking to clear out existing stock of its largest ‌iMac‌, using the higher gift card value as an incentive for customers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs a reminder, ‌Apple Store‌ gift cards can be utilized for several purchases, including products, accessories, music, movies, TV shows, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, and more.
