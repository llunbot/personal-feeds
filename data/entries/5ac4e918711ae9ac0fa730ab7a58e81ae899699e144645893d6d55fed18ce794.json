This is my Ritchey with a Crust Clydesdale cargo fork. I had always loved the look and functionality of the fork and had been searching for a good XL frame to put one on. When I found this Ritchey on Facebook it was perfect. The frame is a perfect fit for me and I love the way it looks with the cargo fork.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/DSC7998-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Sachs 2×9 gripshift still works great, and the LX levers are perfect for one-finger braking! I also just recently added the Doom Bars and it fully completes this build for me. Thanks for looking!</p>\n<p>-Sam Baskin</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/DSC7990-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/DSC8001-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Parts:</strong><br />\nCrust Cargo Fork 1″<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.doombars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Doom Bars</a> 4″ rise and 780mm wide<br />\nCane Creek 40 headset<br />\nSachs 2×9 Gripshift<br />\nDeore LX brake levers<br />\nXT 9 speed rear derailleur<br />\nUltegra front derailleur<br />\nWTB Speed saddle<br />\nTRP Spyre front brake<br />\nDeore LX rear brake<br />\nRandom flat pedals<br />\nESI grips</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
