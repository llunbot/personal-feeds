Fortunately, a new iPad mini is rumored to be released next year, and we have outlined what to expect from the device below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-2021-youtube.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\nApple released the current iPad mini in September 2021, with new features at the time including a larger 8.3-inch display, a USB-C port, a Touch ID power button, the A15 Bionic chip, 5G support on cellular models, a 12-megapixel rear camera with Center Stage support, compatibility with the second-generation Apple Pencil, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Launch Timing</h2>\r<br />\nApple is aiming to begin mass production of the seventh-generation iPad mini at some point <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/\">in the second half of 2024</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, meaning the device would be manufactured in July or later. Apple rarely announces new products in July or August, so the next iPad mini will most likely be unveiled in September or October next year based on the rumored production timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Expected Features</h2>\r<br />\n<ul><li>As part of a routine spec bump, the next iPad mini will likely be equipped with a faster <strong>A16 Bionic chip</strong> at a minimum.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Upgraded front and rear cameras</strong> are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/\">rumored</a> for the new iPad mini.
