Physical access to a device is not required, and the attack can be executed through a malicious site that bypasses Apple's browser protections.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral Apple A-series and M-series chips are affected, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> and later and the A15 and later, which are in the following devices:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>2022 and later Mac notebooks</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2023 and later Mac desktops</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2021 and later <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2021 and later iPhones</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nSLAP and FLOP were disclosed to Apple in May 2024 and September 2024, respectively, and while the attacks have not yet been patched, the researchers who reported the issue were told that Apple plans to address the vulnerabilities in an upcoming security update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple told <em><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-apple-cpu-side-channel-attack-steals-data-from-browsers/\">Bleeping Computer</a></em> that it has not yet patched the flaws. \"We want to thank the researchers for their collaboration as this proof of concept advances our understanding of these types of threats,\" Apple said. \"Based on our analysis, we do not believe this issue poses an immediate risk to our users.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSLAP affects Safari, while FLOP affects Safari and Chrome. Other browsers like Firefox could be affected too, but have not been tested. There is no evidence that SLAP and FLOP have been executed in the wild.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDetails on how SLAP and FLOP work can be <a href=\"https://predictors.fail\">found on the website</a> dedicated to explaining the vulnerabilities.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vulnerabiltiies/\">Vulnerabiltiies</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/apple-web-browser-vulnerabilities/\">Apple to Patch Web Browser Vulnerabilities Affecting Recent Macs, iPads and iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-patch-web-browser-vulnerabilities-affecting-recent-macs-ipads-and-iphones.2448291/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"99aa55e5315af9ee8e52d5c641a832cf5eb861bac2e2974129560290eb2816e4","category":"Apple"}
