{"title":"Willie Mays, Greatest Centerfielder in Baseball History, Dies at 93","link":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/giants/article/willie-mays-dead-obituary-17815215.php","date":1718759943000,"content":"\n<p>John Shea, the San Francisco Chronicle:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Willie Mays, the iconic and endearing “Say Hey Kid” who charmed\ncountless fans with his brilliant athleticism and graceful style\nand was widely considered baseball’s greatest and most\nentertaining player, died Tuesday of heart failure. He was 93.</p>\n\n<p>“My father has passed away peacefully and among loved ones,” Mays\nson, Michael Mays, said. “I want to thank you all from the bottom\nof my broken heart for the unwavering love you have shown him over\nthe years. You have been his life’s blood.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Mays spent most of his 23-year playing career with the Giants, six\nin New York and 15 in San Francisco, making him a cherished\nsuperstar from coast to coast. He hit 660 home runs, made 24\nAll-Star appearances and won 12 Gold Gloves, which weren’t given\nout until Mays’ sixth season.</p>\n\n<p>The consummate five-tool player, Mays was elite at hitting, power\nhitting, defending, throwing and baserunning, and his ability to\nout-think and out-smart the competition served as a valuable\nsixth tool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My dad was a clerk in the Navy, stationed in New York for a stint in the late 1950s, and they’d give free tickets to servicemen to attend ballgames for all three teams in the city: the Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants. At the time, all three clubs had centerfielders destined for the Hall of Fame: Mickey Mantle, Duke Snider, and Mays. My dad has never wavered from his conviction that Willie Mays was the best baseball player he ever saw, hands down. He hit for power and average, ran like the wind, made catches no one else could make, and had a cannon for an arm.</p>\n\n<p>Best ballplayer I’ve seen play was Mays’s godson, Barry Bonds.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/18/willie-mays-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8e69d3e2427df95e702521b779520faa889bff7fac685f626a350a3cbb711762","category":"Tech"}
