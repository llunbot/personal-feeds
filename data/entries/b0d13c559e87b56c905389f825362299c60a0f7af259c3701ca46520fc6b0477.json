In this case, however, it just seems to reflect a quirk of timing which means Apple didn’t have time to load macOS 14.4 on to the new MacBooks before sending them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, don’t panic. And enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218281/new-emoji-ios-17-4-broken-chain-mushroom-lime-right-facing.html\">new emoji</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">Updating macOS on your Mac</a> is a simple process. If you miss the prompts at setup, simply go to System Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> and follow the instructions there.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b0d13c559e87b56c905389f825362299c60a0f7af259c3701ca46520fc6b0477","category":"Apple"}
