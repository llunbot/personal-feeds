The camera begins on a window, and\npulls back, and moves up until we see the skyline of the city, and\nthen it seems to fly through the air, turning as it moves so that\nwe sweep above an endless urban vista. Skyscrapers and bridges and\ntenements and elevated railways crowd each other all the way to\nthe distant horizon, until we realize this is the grandest and\nmost squalid city that ever was. It’s more than a place: It’s the\ndistillation of the idea of City — of the vast, brooding,\nmysterious metropolis spreading in all directions forever,\nconcealing millions of lives and secrets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/warren_beatty_and_dick_tracy_debate_beattys_dick_tracy\">Last’s night thing</a> had me thinking I should rewatch <em>Dick Tracy</em>, which I’m pretty sure I’ve only seen once, in the theater back when I was in high school. Ebert’s review seals the deal.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/27/ebert-review-of-dick-tracy\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f7cc5812805fab33e3f49b04933227bf861bdb69dd250014b94ea1ad891b492c","category":"Tech"}
