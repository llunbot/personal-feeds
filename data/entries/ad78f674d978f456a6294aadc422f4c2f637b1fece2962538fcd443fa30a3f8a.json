This is even more true of the mobile experience, which didn't have a mobile app until 2016, and even then, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1345tha/why_is_the_reddit_app_so_bad/\">not everyone's a fan of it</a>. The site's popularity rose partly thanks to third-party developers filling in the gaps with pre-existing and better mobile apps. Last month, following in the footsteps of Twitter, Reddit suddenly announced it <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/\">wanted to charge</a> apps for API access, but how much? Would it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/twitter-just-realized-it-was-dumb-to-cut-off-automated-public-service-tweets/\">pull a Twitter</a> and price everything out of the market?</p>\n<p>The most popular Reddit app is the iOS app Apollo, which has been running for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/\">eight years now</a> and has millions of downloads. Apollo's developer, Christian Selig, has <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/\">been in meetings</a> with Reddit regarding the cost of the API, and it sounds like the company is using a recent Twitter tactic. Selig says \"50 million requests costs $12,000, a figure far more than I ever could have imagined.\" Twitter, for the record, is charging $42,000 for 50 million tweets. Selig cites the photo site Imgur as a more reasonable pricing scheme, \"I pay Imgur (a site similar to Reddit in user base and media) $166 for the same 50 million API calls.\" Selig estimates it would cost $20 million a year to keep Apollo running.</p>\n<p>Apollo and most other third-party apps use Reddit's data but don't show Reddit's ads, so the proliferation of third-party apps costs Reddit money. It's reasonable to expect some money to change hands here, but how much? Selig links to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/11/reddit-users-are-the-least-valuable-of-any-social-network.html\">a CNBC report</a> from 2019 that estimated Reddit earns 30 cents a year per user and says Reddit's API pricing would work out to about $2.50 per user per <em>month</em> or $30 a year, which aligns with Imgur's pricing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943325#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943325&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ad78f674d978f456a6294aadc422f4c2f637b1fece2962538fcd443fa30a3f8a","category":"Tech"}
