The 3rd-gen AirPods AirPods are a strong possibility for an update, as well as the aging AirPods Max, but not AirPods Pro. Reports have stated that the AirPods Pro won’t get upgrades until next year–the current 2nd-gen model with a USB-C case was released in September 2023, so they’re not even a year old and should stay on shelves for a bit. Or will they?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an X post by Kosutami, the active noise cancelation is going to get better in the AirPods Pro. Kosutami has a history of being accurate with past reports on Apple products. Still, when asked to clarify when the “AirPods Pro is coming,” Kosutami <a href=\"https://x.com/_nico/status/1828332179987873800\">responded</a> only with a vague “Soon.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>The new AirPods Pro is coming—perform with Digital ANC that much better than previous version.</p>— Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1828313529369125020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 27, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2268810/airpods-4-fall-2024-noise-cancellation-budget-model.html\">reported</a> in March that active noise cancelation will expand to at least one non-pro model. If Apple has made changes to its ANC implementation, the company may want to release it with both the non-pro and Pro models at the same time. It’s also possible that the 4th-gen AirPods have the same noise-cancelation as the current AirPods Pro, while Apple improves it on the 3rd-gen AirPods Pro. Either way, we might see an AirPods Pro update at Glowtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple released the 2nd gen AirPods Pro in September 2023, the company improved the ANC, touting “2x more Active Noise Cancelation” than the original AirPods Pro, so we’re not sure how much better the new model would be.
