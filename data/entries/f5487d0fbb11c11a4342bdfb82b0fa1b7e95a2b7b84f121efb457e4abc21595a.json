Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou, which is estimated to manufacture around 80 percent of the world's iPhones, has raised its new hires bonus to a record high of 10,200 yuan (U.S. $1,578).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, Lens Technology has doubled its bonus 5,000 yuan in February to 10,000 yuan in May, while Luxshare Precision's factory in Guangdong has doubled its internal referral bonus from 2,500 yuan in April to 5,000 yuan in May, with a top-up bonus of 3,800 yuan for returning workers who previously left the company.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past three years, Apple has added more new suppliers from mainland China to its vendor list than any other country, but simultaneously the growth of China's labor force has peaked as factory jobs have started to lose their appeal and more workers move out of industrial labor, leading to companies having to lure in workers with more attractive pay packages.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe current aggressive hiring spree seeks to combat increasingly ramped-up production for the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, which are believed to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/iphone-13-release-date-timeframe/\">on track</a> for launch late next month.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/scmp-com/\">scmp.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luxshare/\">Luxshare</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/apple-suppliers-struggling-ahead-of-iphone-13/\">Apple Suppliers Struggling to Hire Enough Workers Ahead of iPhone 13 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-suppliers-struggling-to-hire-enough-workers-ahead-of-iphone-13-launch.2306725/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4EoKc79XSe8:2vVup8NSgo0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4EoKc79XSe8:2vVup8NSgo0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4EoKc79XSe8\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f5487d0fbb11c11a4342bdfb82b0fa1b7e95a2b7b84f121efb457e4abc21595a","category":"Apple"}
