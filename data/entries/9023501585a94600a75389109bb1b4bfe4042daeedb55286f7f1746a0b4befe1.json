On the vast majority of D&amp;B games, you end up wagering money (in the form of gameplay chips) to win virtual tickets that can be traded for trinkets at the rewards counter.</p>\n<p>Now, the massive arcade chain has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240429412806/en/The-Game-Within-The-Game-Lucra-Establishes-B2B-Presence-with-Blockbuster-Dave-and-Buster%E2%80%99s-Deal\">announced</a> that players will soon be able to use the D&amp;B app to directly wager on the results of arcade games through \"real-money contests.\" The arcade giant, which has over 200 locations across North America, is partnering with <a href=\"https://www.lucrasports.com/\">\"gamification layer\" platform Lucra</a> on a system that will let D&amp;B Rewards members \"digitally compete with each other, earn rewards, and unlock exclusive perks while competing with friends at Dave &amp; Buster’s,\" according to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240429412806/en/The-Game-Within-The-Game-Lucra-Establishes-B2B-Presence-with-Blockbuster-Dave-and-Buster%E2%80%99s-Deal\">Tuesday's announcement</a>.</p>\n<p>Neither Lucra nor Dave &amp; Buster's has responded to a request for comment from Ars Technica, so we're still missing extremely basic information, like what games will support app-based wagering, minimum and maximum bet sizes, or what kinds of fees might be involved. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/dave-busters-to-allow-customers-to-bet-on-arcade-games.html\">CNBC's report</a> on the announcement suggests the system will be launching \"in the next few months\" to players 18 and older across 44 states (and specifically mention Skee-Ball and Hot Shots Basketball competitions). <a href=\"https://lucrasports.com/case-studies/dave-and-busters.html\">Lucra's webpage</a> simply says the integration will \"provide... social connectivity and friendly competition,\" suggesting you'll probably face off against friends playing in the same location.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021157#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021157&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9023501585a94600a75389109bb1b4bfe4042daeedb55286f7f1746a0b4befe1","category":"Tech"}
