Regulators said the\ncompany failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the European\nUnion’s highest court that Facebook data shipped across the\nAtlantic was not sufficiently protected from American spy\nagencies.</p>\n\n<p>But it remains unclear if or when Meta will ever need to cordon\noff the data of Facebook users in Europe. Meta said it would\nappeal the decision, setting up a potentially lengthy legal\nprocess.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A billion here, a billion there, and soon enough you’re talking about real money.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/facebook-eu-fine\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"30648286eb44e9b87aa95e001687b1a323bc08ae192cdb2389f6ee40925976ce","category":"Tech"}
