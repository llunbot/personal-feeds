He also\n<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1784561310883344542\">wrote</a> in a post on X a few days later that Tesla\nwould spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and\ninference AI.”</p>\n\n<p>But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside\nthe company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of\nTesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia\nstaffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of\nAI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media\ncompany X, formerly known as Twitter. [...]</p>\n\n<p>By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of\nTesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500\nmillion in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely\nadding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it\nneeds to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The argument against one person being the CEO of multiple companies is generally about distraction/attention — that each CEO gig demands all of one’s available time. But here’s a case where two of Musk’s companies are in direct conflict with each other. Musk seemingly treats all of his companies as subsidiaries of his own personal fiefdom conglomerate, but they aren’t. And unlike X Corp, Tesla Motors is publicly traded.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-06-04/musk-chose-who-got-chips?srnd=undefined\">Matt Levine, in his Money Stuff column</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The extremely obvious answer is that you should not be the CEO and\ncontrolling shareholder of two different companies that compete\nfor the same inputs! There is not a <em>good</em> answer! You can’t,\nlike, put this problem into the Good Governance Machine and have\nit come out clean. The problem is that you have a fiduciary\nobligation to the shareholders of one company to put their\ninterests first, and you have a fiduciary obligation to the\nshareholders of the other company to put their interests first,\nand you cannot do both. This is why one person is not usually the\nCEO of two different companies that compete with each other, and,\nwhen someone is, people get mad at him all the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can’t recall a situation like this when, say, Jack Dorsey was CEO of Twitter and Square, or, going back further, when Steve Jobs was CEO of Apple and Pixar. In those cases it was more like an athlete who played two different sports, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/sports/baseball/shohei-ohtani-bo-jackson.html\">Bo Jackson</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016459.html\">Deion Sanders</a>. Fans of one their teams might argue that they could do even better in that one sport by concentrating on it year-round, but you couldn’t argue that the Kansas City Royals were competing against the Oakland Raiders. With Musk and AI, it’s like he’s playing on several competing teams within the same league.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/04/musk-nvidia-tesla-x\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dd6b09948700c92e5551d94b0257e5ed636354bd949bfc591c77d6906e6c1a48","category":"Tech"}
