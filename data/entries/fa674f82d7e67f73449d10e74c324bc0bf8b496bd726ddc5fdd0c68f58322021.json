This is made possible by a shallow and wide rim that uses a front and rear wheel-specific carbon layup. Compared to its predecessor the new rim carries a 15% increase in front wheel strength, and a 25% increase for the rear wheel. Additionally, the rim shape is engineered to “ankle”, providing adaptive rotation for improved traction and control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Traverse HD Rim</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-floating-HD-e1719945540748.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-floating-HD-e1719945540748.jpeg\" alt=\"Roval Traverse SL and HD i9 Wheelsets floating HD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-floating-HD-e1719945540748.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-floating-HD-e1719945540748-297x110.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-floating-HD-e1719945540748-120x45.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-floating-HD-e1719945540748-768x285.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Roval claims that the Traverse HD is the “strongest carbon trail wheels we have ever tested. Period.” Combining their strongest rim shape and offset spoke drilling, the Traverse HD i9 1/1 makes the new Stumpjumper even more capable if going big on a trail bike is your thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Traverse Wheelset Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>No More Pinch Flats?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead.jpeg\" alt=\"Roval Traverse SL and HD i9 Wheelsets flat bead\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-flat-bead-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The optimized “Flat Top” bead profile of Traverse (US patent pending) wheels claims to significantly reduce pinch flats. It requires an impressive 85% more force to pinch flat when compared to a round bead. Register your wheels within the first 90 days and enjoy the peace of mind that a lifetime warranty offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Air Time</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-BedThread.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-BedThread.jpeg\" alt=\"Roval Traverse SL and HD i9 Wheelsets BedThread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-BedThread.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-BedThread-297x165.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-BedThread-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-BedThread-768x425.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can thank Chuck Teixeira for the genius “Roval ThreadBed Valve”. The ThreadBed Valve is a valve that threads directly to the rim. Thus, eliminating compression nuts, and air loss from rim flex. this makes tire setup easier and reduces sealant clogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Speedy Engagement</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub.jpeg\" alt=\"Roval Traverse SL and HD i9 Wheelsets Industry Nine 1:1 hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-Industry-Nine-11-hub-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>I know this is a front hub…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The i9 1/1 hub provides precise engagement via a dual phases-pawl drive mechanism. This results in 90 points of engagement and 4° engagement via a six-pawl driver and 45-tooth drivering. Perfect for ratcheting through techy sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-bermin.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"783\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-bermin.jpeg\" alt=\"Roval Traverse SL and HD i9 Wheelsets bermin'\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-bermin.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-bermin-297x182.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-bermin-120x73.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Roval-Traverse-SL-and-HD-i9-Wheelsets-bermin-768x470.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Traverse SL II i9 Wheelset</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $600 (ft), $900 (rr)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>INTENDED USE: Trail</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WEIGHT (29): 1,780g (with valves and tape)—809g front, 971g rear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SPOKE COUNT F/R: 28H Front and Rear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HUB: Industry Nine 1/1 6B</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HUB ENGAGEMENT: 45 Teeth / 4 Degrees</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WHEEL SIZES: 29</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifetime warranty on Roval Wheels when registered within the first 90 days of purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2-Year “It Happens” No Fault Crash Replacement – If you damage your Roval product while riding within the first two years of ownership and it’s not covered under warranty, we’ll still replace or repair it.
