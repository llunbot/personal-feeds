Since Nothing's smartphone is targeting roughly the same group of smartphone buyers as the ‌iPhone 16e‌, we thought we'd do a comparison.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16e‌ is priced at $599, which is higher than any other budget smartphone that Apple has released to date, while the <a href=\"https://us.nothing.tech/products/phone-3a-pro\">3a Pro</a> is quite a bit more affordable at $459. The 3a Pro has some bells and whistles you won't get with the ‌iPhone 16e‌ like extra cameras and a larger display, but the Qualcomm chip in the 3a Pro really can't compete with the A18 in the ‌iPhone 16e‌. It's <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/nothing_phone_3a_pro-review-2809p4.php\">not even close</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the ‌iPhone 16e‌ has a 6.1-inch display, the 3a Pro has a larger 6.8-inch display, and it's notably larger and heavier. It has a brighter OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, while the 16e display is limited to 60Hz. In terms of design, the 16e has a classic, understated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> look with a single camera, while the 3a Pro has a large rear camera circle, a stylized mechanical look, and a ring of LED lights at the back that serve as notification alerts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Nothing Phone 3a Pro has an eye-catching design for sure, but it might also be a bit much for some people. There's a single 48-megapixel Wide camera in the ‌iPhone 16e‌, but the 3a Pro has a trio of cameras, including a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel Telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBattery life is about the same between the two, and the 3a Pro has no wireless charging feature while the 16e supports slow Qi-based wireless charging. The 3a Pro does charge faster though, because it supports up to 50W wired charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNothing hasn't gone all in on AI like Apple, but there is a dedicated AI button that opens up the Essential Space, which is an AI-powered hub for notes, ideas, and inspirations. There are no image generation features or custom emoji, but it is a truly useful feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, the major difference between the two is iOS vs. Android, so while the 3a Pro is a solid value with a good feature set, it's probably not going to lure ‌iPhone‌ users out of Apple's ecosystem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat do you think of the Nothing Phone 3a Pro?
