The 32-year-old Australian became the first rider to win both the Olympic and World Championship individual time-trial titles in the same year, beating the Netherlands’ Demi Vollering by 16sec to secure the rainbow bands. Defending champion Chloé Dygert of the United States finished third. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown set the best time at the first intermediate checkpoint by 6sec but fell behind Vollering by almost 9sec at the second check. She emptied the tank over the final stretch of the 29.9km course to finish with a time of 39min 16sec. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Olympics in late July, she dominated the field on the rainy streets of Paris, winning by 1min 31sec ahead of Great Britain’s Anna Henderson. A gold medal and a rainbow jersey is surely the perfect way to go into retirement.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

hours after Brown’s heroics, more history was made in the men’s event. Olympic ITT gold medallist Remco Evenepoel matched Brown’s achievement by also riding to victory at the World Championships, covering the 46.1km course at an average speed of 52.2kmh.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a close call between the Belgian and Italy’s Filippo Ganna. Ganna was the penultimate rider to set off and recorded a new fastest time of 53min 08sec at the finish line, knocking compatriot Edoardo Affini off the hot seat and catching Primož Roglič just before the line. However, Ganna only had a few seconds to enjoy it before Evenepoel – who later revealed he was riding without a power meter – shaved six seconds off his time to claim the rainbow jersey for the second year in a row. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia’s Jay Vine had held the best time at the third intermediate time check before Ganna and Evenepoel passed through, however he arrived at the finish line covered in blood and sporting a ripped skinsuit. The TV cameras didn’t catch the crash that pushed Vine out of medal contention, but he later described it as a ‘silly mistake on a non-technical section’ that was ‘gut wrenching’. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thomas De Gendt retires  </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/20190713TDF0014-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Alex Broadway</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotto-Dstny’s Thomas De Gendt has called time on his career, retiring after Paris-Chauny where he finished 59th and was presented with a trophy from the race to mark the occasion.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 37-year-old Belgian has had a fruitful career with 17 pro victories.
