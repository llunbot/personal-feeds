A few posts on the PixelWatch subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/13wnpdw/this_just_happened/\">have photos</a> of this phenomenon; several commenters say it happened to them, too.</p>\n<p>This certainly seems like something Google should cover under warranty, and with the device being less than a year old, everyone should be under warranty. You also have a strong argument if you contact Google support about a device that has fallen apart. The scary thing is that this will also compromise the device's water resistance, and we doubt Google is covering every instance of water damage. Most reports indicate Google is taking care of the problem, but a few users were initially threatened with a $300 repair fee, which was later waived.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to my excessive sweating (I believe) the glue on the back of my pixel watch dissolved and the back has popped off. <a href=\"https://t.co/ltUQauXC4I\">pic.twitter.com/ltUQauXC4I</a></p>\n<p>â€” SuperSanusi (@supersanusi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/supersanusi/status/1663477737623900165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>When iFixit <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pixel-watch-teardown-shows-off-ugly-insides-gives-strong-first-gen-vibes/\">tore down</a> the Pixel Watch, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/67379/our-teardown-engineers-favorite-pixel-watch-feature-mystery-adhesive\">it noted</a> the back adhesive was a novel \"liquid gasket\" the site had never seen before. The report said, \"The rear glass appears to be held in place by a kind of liquid gasket that seals tightly, but comes open clean. It also peels off the glass with virtually no residue.\" It sounds like Google's fancy glue peels off a little too easily. Poorly adhered back panels were also a recent problem with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/ays2y2/the_charging_contact_on_the_back_of_my_fossil/\">Fossil watches</a>, and in the \"Gen 6\" versions, Fossil <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/08/30/fossil-gen-6/\">acknowledged</a> the problem and said it was fixed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944115#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944115&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b89d1fa8a0dfc411b68272a71b40e300505e63d4c54cf3955754d38d71274d2c","category":"Tech"}
