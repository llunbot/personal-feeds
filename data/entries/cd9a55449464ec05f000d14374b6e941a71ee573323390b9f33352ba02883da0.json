BLM lands are especially popular for mountain biking, climbing, hunting and fishing, and motorized use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Utah-New-Years-2023-2024-105.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Utah-New-Years-2023-2024-105.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Utah-New-Years-2023-2024-105.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Utah-New-Years-2023-2024-105.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Utah-New-Years-2023-2024-105.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Since 2015, visits to BLM lands have increased by 35% (<a href=\"https://americaslands.org/wp-content/uploads/APL-Recreation-Report.pdf?utm_source=1500+CWP+List+Daily+Clips+and+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=822380163a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2023_11_15_10_44&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-822380163a-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D\">source</a>).
