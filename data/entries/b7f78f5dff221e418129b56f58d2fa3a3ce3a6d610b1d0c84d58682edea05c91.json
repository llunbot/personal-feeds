{"title":"[Sponsor] Streaks and Little Streaks","link":"https://streaks.app/","date":1732584492000,"content":"\n<p>Streaks first appeared on Daring Fireball <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/03/streaks\">back in 2016</a>, and since then has won an Apple Design Award and remained one of the most well-known and effective habit-tracking apps.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a once-off purchase, and the latest update has added seasonal themes, just in time for Christmas (and your New Year’s resolutions!).</p>\n\n<p>If you have young children, be sure to also try Little Streaks. It’s a great way to help them focus on routines: meal-time, bed-time, learning to ride, whatever you like! It’s free for one routine, or use code “DARING” for 50% off the first year.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2024/11/streaks_and_little_streaks\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"Daring Fireball Department of Commerce","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b7f78f5dff221e418129b56f58d2fa3a3ce3a6d610b1d0c84d58682edea05c91","category":"Tech"}
