Let’s check out the winners and losers from the past month of pro racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winners</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1705\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Demons quashed. Simon Yates exploded into life on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\">Colle delle Finestre</a> on the final day of May – the climb that he lost the race to Chris Froome on in 2018 – to ride to his first Giro d’Italia title. The man from Bury had been testing the waters with some light accelerations away from Isaac del Toro and Richard Carapaz but launched the attack that would ultimately stick with 37km of the race remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Rome, Yates sealed his second Grand Tour victory by 3min 56sec over Del Toro. It was a Giro for the ages.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Lidl-Trek</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217835163-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lidl-Trek lost team leader Giulio Ciccone early on at the Giro, however Mads Pedersen wore the first <em>maglia rosa</em> and the squad racked up six stage victories along the way. Most of those are thanks to Pedersen with Daan Hoole and Carlos Verona winning one each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was such an impressive feat of points sweeping along the way that Pedersen mathematically secured the <em>ciclamino</em> jersey on Stage 19. The Dane was in such good form that he was dropping Verona on the Finestre.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the finest writing and photography delivered every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-5-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-970x653.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-970x653.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-300x202.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-768x517.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-1536x1035.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-2048x1380.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-750x505.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215729491-1-1140x768.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Close but no cigar was the theme for Wout van Aert going into the Giro. Second and fourth places littered his Classics season. But when the Giro returned to Siena – where he won Strade Bianche in 2020 – he was a different rider. He had shaken the proverbial monkey off his back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert and Del Toro went clear after dropping earlier breakaway companion Egan Bernal. A dramatic fight up Via Santa Caterina ensued with Van Aert coming around Del Toro over the top and keeping his position onto the Piazza del Campo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later on in the race, he delivered a fierce leadout to help teammate Olav Kooij to his victories on Stage 12 and 21, and was the key satellite rider to propel Yates to the overall win after the Finestre.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

If you were told there’d be a UAE Team Emirates XRG rider on the verge of winning the 2025 Giro d’Italia, it’s likely you’d think it be Juan Ayuso. Instead it was 21-year-old Isaac del Toro who stepped into the spotlight and had one of the most stunning rises to a Grand Tour podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the Strade Bianche stage that saw Del Toro get a taste of pink for the first time. After breaking away with Wout van Aert the pair raced up the Via Santa Caterina, with Van Aert taking the lead through the final corners to win the day and Del Toro moving in the pink jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He remained there for almost two weeks, even when it looked as though he was struggling. The third week was always going to be a test given this is new territory for Del Toro as a leader. He began to slip backwards on Stage 16 as Simon Yates and Richard Carapaz clawed back time. Carapaz jumped ahead to shave the deficit from 2min 07sec to just 31sec while Yates went frm 1min 20sec to just 26sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Del Toro bounced back by winning the next stage and extending his lead, but with 13km remaining before the summit of the Colle delle Finestre on Stage 20 both Del Toro and Carapaz watched Yates ride away into the sunset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It raised many questions. Should they have followed? Could they have followed? Whose responsibility was it to chase? After the finish they blamed each other, but young Del Toro seemed the happier of the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Giro d’Italia GC contenders</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216842232-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many riders saw their <em>maglia rosa </em>ambitions fall by the wayside this month. None earlier than Soudal-QuickStep’s Mikel Landa, who crashed out on the opening stage. A few days later and it was the turn of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe’s Jai Hindley, key domestique for Primož Roglič.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giulio Ciccone was the next to go. The Italian crashed on Stage 14, lost 16 minutes and abandoned the next morning. Then Primož Roglič stepped off the bike, forcing Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe to pivot to Giulio Pellizzari and a breakaway win. Perhaps the strangest DNF came from Ayuso, who couldn’t continue after a bee stung him on the eye, adding insult to his injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215912275-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Billy Ceusters/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel’s return to mountain biking didn’t quite go as planned. The Dutchman crashed twice at the MTB XCO World Cup in Nové Město and broke his wrist, casting doubt on his Critérium du Dauphiné and Tour de France participations. He will not travel to La Plagne for Alpecin-Deceuninck’s altitude training camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sprinters at the Tour de France</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-970x637.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-970x637.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-300x197.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-768x504.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-1536x1009.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-2048x1345.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-750x493.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2164628384-1140x749.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Pool/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no normal Champs-Élysées sprint finish at the Tour de France this year. Breaking from tradition, organisers ASO are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Champs-Élysées finale by adding three ascents of the Montmartre climb that featured in the Olympic road races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the final ascent coming just 6km from the finish line it’s likely the main sprinters will be out of contention. Will this be the year we see another breakaway victory? Fingers crossed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-winners-losers-may-2025\">Pro cycling winners and losers in May</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"990b778f4d80e31a5c468886d364a23c5237977e86b902fbfcdb3aa773dadff3","category":"Cycling"}
