{"title":"Ten months after first tease, OpenAI launches Sora video generation publicly","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/","date":1733771184000,"content":"<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/\">released</a> Sora Turbo, a new version of its text-to-video generation model, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers through a <a href=\"https://sora.com/\">dedicated website</a>. The model generates videos up to 20 seconds long at resolutions reaching 1080 p from a text or image prompt.</p>\n<p>Open AI announced that Sora would be available today for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers in the US and many parts of the world but is not yet available in Europe. As of early Monday afternoon, though, even existing Plus subscribers trying to use the tool are being presented with a message that \"sign ups are temporarily unavailable\" thanks to \"heavy traffic.\"</p>\n<p>Out of an abundance of caution, OpenAI is limiting Sora's ability to generate videos of people for the time being. At launch, uploads involving human subjects face restrictions while OpenAI refines its deepfake prevention systems. The platform also blocks content involving CSAM and sexual deepfakes. OpenAI says it maintains an active monitoring system and conducted testing to identify potential misuse scenarios before release.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards and Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3dd2e894e3cb98212bd5652482a020b63a0006798b9b671b7e59c4e8bee8d819","category":"Tech"}
