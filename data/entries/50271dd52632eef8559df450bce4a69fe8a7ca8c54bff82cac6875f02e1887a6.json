{"title":"T-Mobile's 'Ultra Capacity' 5G Now Covers 200 Million People","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/15/t-mobile-ultra-capacity-5g-milestone/","date":1637019200000,"content":"T-Mobile <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobiles-game-changing-ultra-capacity-5g-now-reaches-200-million-people-nationwide\">today announced</a> that its high-speed \"Ultra Capacity 5G\" is now available to 200 million people across the United States, with the carrier hitting the milestone weeks ahead of schedule.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/tmobilelogo.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nUltra Capacity 5G is T-Mobile's higher-speed 5G network that's faster than the Extended Range 5G network that covers 308 million T-Mobile customers. While Extended Range 5G offers LTE-like speeds, Ultra Capacity 5G is more capable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile initially planned to cover 200 million people by the end of 2021, and has met that goal early. As noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783712/t-mobile-5g-ultra-capacity-mmwave-200-million-coverage\">The Verge</a></em>, this is a theoretical maximum based on the coverage that T-Mobile offers. In reality, T-Mobile has just over 100 million subscribers, not all of whom will be able to access the 5G speeds due to location or device limitations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile's Ultra Capacity 5G largely relies on mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum rather than the mmWave 5G spectrum used by other carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon. As T-Mobile explains in the press release announcing the coverage, the company aimed for mid-band spectrum to bring 5G speeds to the maximum number of people, and T-Mobile has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/21/tmobile-sprint-network-merging/\">rolling out the 2.5GHz spectrum</a> since it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/01/t-mobile-sprint-merger-completed/\">acquired Sprint</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFaster mmWave 5G speeds from AT&amp;T and Verizon are largely limited to select areas in major cities, though both carriers have slower sub-6GHz 5G coverage available as well. AT&amp;T and Verizon were planning on rolling out mid-band spectrum starting this year, but their plans have been delayed due to the FAA's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/04/att-verizon-5g-c-band-delayed/\">concerns about aircraft interference</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile's focus on mid-band spectrum is the reason why T-Mobile was the fastest 5G carrier in the United States <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/24/t-mobile-fastest-us-carrier-5g-test/\">in <em>PCMag</em>'s annual test</a>. T-Mobile's wider coverage allowed the carrier to achieve the highest average speeds of 162.3Mb/s, beating out AT&amp;T and Verizon. Verizon had the fastest speeds overall, but its coverage was much more limited due to the current lack of mid-band spectrum and the limited availability of its mmWave speeds. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/15/t-mobile-ultra-capacity-5g-milestone/\">T-Mobile's 'Ultra Capacity' 5G Now Covers 200 Million People</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobiles-ultra-capacity-5g-now-covers-200-million-people.2323534/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ocscz_c7KFo:FiazbjI9rJo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ocscz_c7KFo:FiazbjI9rJo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"50271dd52632eef8559df450bce4a69fe8a7ca8c54bff82cac6875f02e1887a6","category":"Apple"}
