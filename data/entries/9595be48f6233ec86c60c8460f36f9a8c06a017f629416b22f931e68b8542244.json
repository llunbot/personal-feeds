{"title":"Is Apple’s Spending on TV+ Content a ‘Loss’ or a ‘Cost’?","link":"https://deadline.com/2025/03/apple-appletv-annual-streaming-losses-1236345490/","date":1742573887000,"content":"\n<p>Jill Goldsmith, Deadline:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is losing more than $1 billion a year on streamer Apple TV+,\naccording to a report in the Information that cited two people\nfamiliar with the matter. The tech giant has spent over $5 billion\na year on content since launching Apple TV+ in 2019 but trimmed\nthat by about $500 million last year, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year\">the report said</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The headline on Wayne Ma’s report at The Information set the framework: “<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year\">Apple Streaming Losses Top $1 Billion a Year</a>” — the story got picked up widely, and almost everyone who did framed it in terms of <em>losing</em> or a <em>loss</em>. But is it a <em>loss</em> when Apple expected the business to be unprofitable for a decade or more? <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/apple-tv-reportedly-loses-1-billion-a-year-and-thats-okay-for-now/\">From Scharon Harding’s paraphrasing at Ars Technica</a> of Ma’s paywalled report:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple TV+ being Apple’s only service not turning a profit isn’t\n<em>good</em>, but it’s also expected. Like other streaming services,\nApple TV+ wasn’t expected to be profitable until years after its\nlaunch. An Apple TV+ employee that The Information said reviewed\nthe streaming service’s business plan said Apple TV+ is expected\nto lose $15 billion to $20 billion during its first 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>For comparison, Disney’s direct-to-consumer streaming business had\noperating losses <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2025/02/08/disneys-streaming-unit-loses-three-times-more-money-than-disneyland-paris/\">of $11.4 billion</a> between the launch of\nDisney+ in fall 2020 and April 2024. Disney’s streaming business\nbecame profitable for the first time in its fiscal quarter ending\non June 29, 2024.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above two paragraphs of essential context are buried 13 paragraphs down. If Apple expected TV+ to operate in the red, to the tune of $15–20 billion over its first decade, and halfway through that decade (<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/\">TV+ debuted</a> in November 2019) it operated in the red to the tune of $1 billion for the year — doesn’t that mean costs are exactly in line with their expectations?</p>\n\n<p>The insinuation here is that Apple’s pissing this money away and doesn’t know what they’re doing. Maybe they are! But if so it was exactly Eddy Cue and Tim Cook’s strategy to piss this money away. If Apple had expected TV+ to be profitable or break-even in 2024, then a $1 billion operating loss would be a story. But as it stands it’s just a cost. How much did Apple “lose” on electricity bills last year?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9595be48f6233ec86c60c8460f36f9a8c06a017f629416b22f931e68b8542244","category":"Tech"}
