Last month, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/\">reported</a> that Apple was in discussions with Google to integrate its Gemini AI engine into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as part of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>. The main advantages of on-device processing will be quicker response times and superior privacy compared to cloud-based solutions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's marketing strategy for its AI technology will apparently be based around how it can be useful to users' daily lives, rather than its power. Apple's broader AI strategy is expected to be revealed alongside previews of its major software updates at WWDC in June.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/\">Gurman: Apple Working on On-Device LLM for Generative AI Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-working-on-on-device-llm-for-generative-ai-features.2424609/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e6fe06f33bb96906167a59033958c48462b41616bfe4305bb65e23e8235dae99","category":"Apple"}
