It’s a modern-day reprisal of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/coppi-tour-de-france-1949\" target=\"_blank\">Coppi and Bartali</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-anquetil-and-poulidor-go-head-to-head\" target=\"_blank\">Poulidor and Anquetil</a>,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/greg-lemond-closest-tour-de-france-ever\" target=\"_blank\"> LeMond and Fignon</a>. At long last, cycling has a new duo to enter this hall of fame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past four Tours de France, Pogačar and Vingegaard have duelled with one target in mind: the yellow jersey. After his win at the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> has taken a 3-2 lead in Tour de France wins. The race is on to reach the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/from-the-archive-in-conversation-with-eddy-merckx\">history-equalling fifth</a>, and both seem to have the credentials to do so by the end of the 2020s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the dust settles on another three weeks of battling, can we consider this to be the greatest rivalry the sport has ever seen?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Yin and yang</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej pogacar and jonas vingegaard tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T163412.048.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar and Vingegaard are very different personalities. For starters, the two stem from very different corners of Europe – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Vingegaard</a> from the stoic Scandinavian north and Pogačar from the chocolate-box setting of Mittel Europa. Pogačar’s rise can be tracked from the youngster’s Tour de l’Avenir and breakthrough <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> in 2019. Vinegagaard on the other hand was a lesser-known anomaly who made the most of his ad-hoc leadership role at the Tour de France 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In behaviour, the two differ greatly. Pogačar hits back at haters on social media and has a boyish joker demeanour both on and off the bike. Vingegaard is more sedate with his media language. He’s pensive and thoughtful in a way that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/23/cycling-tour-de-france-winner-jonas-vingegaard-fails-to-win-over-public\" target=\"_blank\">some perceive as cold</a>. At the 2024 race, however, this has evolved into something more humanised as he discussed the internet’s watts-per-kilo claims and online forum mysteries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the 2024 race, they have become more outspoken. With the addition of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Roglič </a>and Evenepoel in the media mix zone, the pair have started a well-measured war of words like any great rivals should.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

are their teams: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have entered a Cold War-like arms race to win the <em>maillot jaune</em>. As the squads realise their potential, they have created the perfect backdrop for this competition. Their differences complement each other, even if it has flared up tribal affiliations for better or worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s UAE Team Emirates have built from a mid-table Italian team to a Grand Tour juggernaut in the space of around five years. However, the Emirati-backed team has been met with some fatigue after buying a wealth of A-list names and <em>wunderkinds</em>. With time though, the squad has played around with tactics and formed a strong identity as cycling’s most consistent team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike are a team often ridiculed for tactical decisions, blunt team communications and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/tour-de-france-unchained-netflix-season-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">an outspoken team principal</a>. However, their clinical 2022 Tour de France proved that they are one of <em>the </em>great teams of modern Grand Tours. The Dutch squad has cultivated real talent, raising names like Sepp Kuss and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> to the fore. The latter has become a phenom unmatched by UAE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two teams have employed wildly different strategies over the years and have gone through ebbs and flows with lady luck. This year, luck was certainly against Visma-Lease a Bike, who only last year won all three Grand Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rivalry hasn’t seen team strength skew. There are few weak links in either outfit and they seem fairly balanced on paper. With both team leaders on long-term contracts, the battalions are forming around them with every new signing. Don’t expect to see a carousel of riders in and out, each addition is signed up with the intention of forming a part of the Tour’s two leading squads. Under these circumstances, the teams are only set to become more influential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An ongoing Tour de France story</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej poagacar and jonas vingegaard riding gc at the tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This rivalry has brewed over the past few years due to the constant ding-dong between the two at each of their Tour de France skirmishes. Each year, they grow stronger and raise the stakes ever higher at the <em>Grande Boucle</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So often, cycling rivalries fizzle out on the big stage. Regardless of contexts in the build-up to the race, Pogačar and Vingegaard have an unflappable way of honouring the biggest race in the sport. With no excuses given, the Tour is the main arena of the rivalry and it can be followed through each year’s edition of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all well and good duelling at smaller week-long stage races, but Pogačar and Vingegaard’s perennial Tour clashes have brought a lifeline to a race that has so often been won too easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They both benefit from a hard-wired desire to win. Both build up all year for the Tour with no ifs or buts. Even if they end up facing setbacks beforehand, they’ll still be at the start line of the race. These are the signs of two true champions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tit for tat</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej pogacar jonas vingegaard tour de france 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T165734.504.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When Pogačar goes, so does Vingegaard. This has been the way now for several Tours de France. That’s what the race distils to. When they attack, they are in a world of their own, free from the influence of any GC side characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a constant adrenaline rush surrounding each instalment of finding out who the best rider on two wheels is. The dynamic shifts throughout the season and has made the Tour outcome tough to call. Their similarity in power and capabilities has allowed the rivalry to blossom into one of cycling’s best ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, it has become harder to decide who’s better at climbing or time-trialling – or even fighting for GC for that matter. Since 2021, only 1:03 separates the two after 84 stages of racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tour superiority has shifted between them year-on-year – and sometimes within the same Tour. In 2022, Vingegaard, along with a blazing Jumbo-Visma squad, proved to be the thorn in his Slovenian rival’s side despite a dominant opening week that forecasted another Pogačar whitewash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This alternating balance of power manifested beautifully at the 2023 Tour, which saw a GC seesaw throughout the first and second weeks of the race when only a handful of seconds separated the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then again at the 2024 race, another chapter was written – this one firmly in Pogačar’s favour, though Vingegaard’s early season injury no doube contributed greatly to the relative mismatch. The story is ongoing and it doesn’t look like it’ll fade out in the future, even if <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel </a>desperately wants to make this a love triangle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An unlocked fan tribalism</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T171024.313.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling has become more sharp at the edges than it has been for quite some time. The tribalism is emblematic of any great rivalry. We have returned to the primordial state of sports where we live for a parasocial rivalry between two men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On social media, fans create video edits, run dedicated accounts and live and die by the sword of their GC favourite. In online discourse, UAE fans and Visma fans throw metaphorical fists in the name of their chosen son. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade ago, this never happened for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/chris-froome\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Froome</a> or Alberto Contador. Pogačar and Vingegaard should take this as a compliment. They’ve captured enough imagination for fans to fight tooth and nail in their name. This culture is not too dissimilar from boyband tribalism or football team derbies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps we’ll reflect on these Tours in decades to come and think, ‘I was more of a Pogačar man, myself.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Put some respect on their names</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-970x647.png\" alt=\"pogacar vingegaard tour de france 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-23T105439.325.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Longevity is key to every rivalry’s significance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great Italian rivalry of Coppi and Bartali only manifested at the Tour de France on a couple of occasions. Their rivalry blossomed at the Giro instead. And even there, they only shared the podium twice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulidor and Anquetil only filled the top two places in the Tour on one occasion. Poulidor and Merckx also only finished first and second on one occasion, with Poulidor more commonly filling the third spot on the podium. Other rivalries such as LeMond and Fignon as well as Pantani and Armstrong also only came truly to the fore at single Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison, Pogačar and Vingegaard have filled the top two spots at the past four Tours de France and there is no sign of this slowing down. If we want to show some respect to the two current greats, then we should elevate their names to the same level as the aforementioned double acts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No smoke without fire</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej pogacar and jonas vinegaard tour de france 2024 stage 12\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T172700.904.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, it all seems in place for it to become a rivalry for the ages. There’s little to separate the two after four years of Tour de France battles. It’s open to debate who the greater rider at the Tour de France is – even if <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-monument-ranking\" target=\"_blank\">Pogačar’s exploits elsewhere in the calendar</a> try to distract from this <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-grand-tours-ranked\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Tour debate</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every rivalry has a shelf life, of course. But in the case of Pogačar and Vingegaard, they’re similar in age, stature and team strength, and both appear to have plenty of years ahead of them at the top of the sport. Currently, their Tour de France <em>palmarès </em>seem competitive enough with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the two appear relatively cordial. There’s no malice here – they respect each other greatly. Just cast your minds back to the iconic mid-race handshake at the 2022 Tour. We’re not in an era of trash talk, heightened tension or slashed tyres like we’ve seen before in the sport, although I’m sure some will feel that these missed spats would have added some spice and colour to the rivalry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer my question: no, this is not the sport’s greatest rivalry. But it certainly has the ingredients to challenge for that title in the next few years.  Who knows, maybe this article will need a revisit after the 2028 Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/prize-money-2024-tour-de-france\">Who won the most prize money at the 2024 Tour de France?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fix-king-of-the-mountains-polka-dot-jersey-tour-de-france\">How to fix the Tour de France King of the Mountains classification</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-breakaways\">Is this the end of Tour de France breakaways?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/future-british-tour-de-france-stars\">Who are Britain’s future Tour de France stars?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vingegaard-rivalry\">Is Pogačar vs Vingegaard cycling’s greatest ever rivalry?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b5843d99ea5efc1b08d4ecedc0f3117a20328d0e24118999dfb02a1d69bed95a","category":"Cycling"}
