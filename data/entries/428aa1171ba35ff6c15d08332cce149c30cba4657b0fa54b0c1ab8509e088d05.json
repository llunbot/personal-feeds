These gloves have small micro bristles and lather up with your favorite cleaning solution to provide a fantastic bike-washing experience. Great for gear as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a sharp, precision screwdriver that fits like a key, the <strong>Hozan JIS Screwdriver Set</strong> ($18 from<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A7WAHTU/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\"> Amazon</a>) is a must-have. Great for derailleur adjustments, linear-pull brakes, and opening the battery portal on those holiday kids’ toys. You really haven’t experienced a good screwdriver until you’ve used a JIS screwdriver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most bang for the buck in the multitool world is the <strong>Crank Bros M10 </strong>($18 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F768256%2Fcrankbrothers-m-10-multi-tool&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a>). Ten tools in a folding package that fits in any saddlebag or ride wallet. The Crank Bros M10 is perfect for the new cyclist, and it has all the fittings to adjust a road or mountain bike, plus it’s only 150g!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Telescoping Magnetic Wand</strong> ($9 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DINDG/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>) is a tool everyone should have in their toolbox, no matter what. If your favorite cyclist doesn’t set them straight right now. From finding those tiny screws we all drop to, well, all kinds of stuff. Just get them one. And get yourself one, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Almost) every cyclist loves a good beer while we’re working on our bikes. Heck, sometimes working on our bikes is an excuse to crack open a cold one. We love <strong><a href=\"https://10barrel.com/\">10 Barrel Brewing</a></strong> and the wide variety of year-round and seasonal means you’ll be able to find a 6-pack to suit anyone’s tastes. Your favorite mechanic is gluten-free? If you can find it (they need to expand to the Midwest &amp; East Coast), <a href=\"https://holidailybrewing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Holidaily</a> offers some of the best completely gluten-free beers around. Alcohol-free? In that case, check out the non-alcoholic beers from the <a href=\"https://athleticbrewing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Athletic Brewing Co.</a> (even a gluten-reduced, non-alcoholic option in there too). Whatever the case, your mechanic will appreciate the gesture – even more so if you take into consideration their dietary or lifestyle needs!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Bike Mechanics Under $50</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1629\" height=\"657\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-50-dollars-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Best gifts for bike mechanics under $50\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-50-dollars-copy.jpg 1629w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-50-dollars-copy-297x120.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-50-dollars-copy-800x323.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-50-dollars-copy-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-50-dollars-copy-768x310.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-50-dollars-copy-1536x619.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge is power, and being able to fix your bike is a fantastic feeling. The team at Park Tool is now on the fourth iteration of their <strong>BBB (Big Blue Book of Bike Repair) </strong>($30 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0976553066/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>), and it has everything one needs – the content is highly current and includes the newest electronic and ebike technology alongside all the classic parts and standards. The Park Tool BBB-4 is great if you’ve been fixing bikes for years or weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to keep your bike working safely and efficiently, a torque wrench will <em>probably </em>save you from a cracked handlebar or a loose seatpost. The <strong>CDI 4-8Nm Torque wrench</strong> ($50 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIRD5CG/?ta=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>) is easy to use, comes from the highly regarded CDI tool line, and is super easy to pack in a gear bag or mobile tool kit. The 4-8Nm is easily adjustable and should cover the stem, seat post, and seat binder torque needs. We highly recommend it for the new carbon bike owner!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike mechanics hate to be without tools, wherever they go. That’s why the <strong>Wolf Tooth Components 6-Bit Hex Wrench Multi-tool</strong> ($47.95 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226063%2Fwolf-tooth-components-6-bit-hex-wrench-bike-multi-tool-with-keyring%3Fcolor%3DBLUE\">REI</a>) is one of our favorite bicycle EDC tools. The diminutive tool can clip on your key chain, zipper, or just stuff in your bag or pocket ensuring you’re never without the standard Allen wrenches, torx bits, &amp; screwdrivers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Feedback Sports Flop Stop Handlebar Holder</strong> ($27.50 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffeedback-sports-flop-stop-handlebar-holder\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) is a great addition to anyone’s repair kit. So much better than the bendy things that go over the handlebars, this one is guaranteed to reduce stress and cursing better than almost any other tool they have. Except maybe a beer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Under $100</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"710\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-100-dollars.jpg\" alt=\"Best gifts for bike mechanics under $100\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-100-dollars.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-100-dollars-297x105.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-100-dollars-800x284.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-100-dollars-120x43.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-100-dollars-768x273.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-100-dollars-1536x545.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s cooler than getting your suspension absolutely dialed? Nothing! The<strong> Blackburn Honest Digital Shock Pump </strong>($90 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT8HK2W/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\">Amazon</a>) is right on the money for those looking for an exact value every time they set up to hit the trails. It’s great for the home mechanic and professional alike with a super easy-to-read backlit screen and a uber precise micro-adjust 2-3 PSI air-bleeder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like to bring your tools to the race or ride, one of our favorites is the <strong>Feedback Sports Ride Prep Tool Kit </strong>($97.99 <a href=\"https://www.moosejaw.com/product/feedback-sports-ride-prep-tool-kit_10342159?skuSelect=3640947&amp;ad_id=Google&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=pla&amp;utm_campaign=MJ-Shopping-Clearance&amp;utm_content=MJ-Shopping-Clearance&amp;cm_mmc=PLA-_-Google-_-MJ-Shopping-Clearance%7CMJ-Shopping-Clearance-_-google%7C12228262265%7C115092327577%7C495729794833%7Cpla-296579245909%7Cc%7C9015669%7C3640947&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAo7KqBhDhARIsAKhZ4ugc9FQjF5RXw4IaYIwQbTrbLpfxkFXiqjPTd19ajPqi4GoufIrYEF4aAphOEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">Moosejaw</a>). It comes in a waterproof folding pouch that’s easy to set up in the parking lot or hatch of your vehicle. The Feedback Sports Ride Prep comes with most of the necessary tools to fix a problem in a hurry, and these tools are heavy-duty, so they promise many years of service ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your derailleur hanger bent? That’s usually the first thing a tech will ask when you come to the shop explaining, “my bike isn’t shifting correctly.” The first process of derailleur adjustment is to check the hanger alignment, and a dependable tool for the job is the <strong>Park Tool DAG-2 Derailleur Alignment Tool</strong> ($85 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T6L22E/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>)<strong>.</strong> It’s easy to use, usually in-stock, and, most shops will tell you, nearly indestructible—a must-have for those building a bicycle toolset for a home workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Bike Mechanics Under $150</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1828\" height=\"551\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Best gifts for bike mechanics under $150\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-copy.jpg 1828w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-copy-297x90.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-copy-800x241.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-copy-120x36.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-copy-768x231.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-copy-1536x463.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your favorite bicycle mechanic spends a lot of time hunched over trying to get disc brakes perfectly adjusted, offer them a seat. The <strong>Park Tool STL-2</strong> ($139.95 <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F211183%2Fpark-tool-stl-2-rolling-shop-stool%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">REI</a>) rolling mechanic stool to be exact. The stool is pneumatically adjustable for height, so you can get down low to better see those brakes. And the five wheels make rolling back and forth between the bench and the work stand a breeze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silca makes some of the most remarkable tools and bits for the bike. Their<strong> T Ratchet Torque Set </strong>($125 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F169797%2Fsilca-t-ratchet-ti-torque-kit&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a>) is a compact multitool that has a torque tube attachment so you can make on-the-fly adjustments on your ride without the worry of over-torquing. The whole package comes in a super slick waterproof pouch that folds easily into a jersey or ride wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Bosch 12v screwdriver</strong> ($139 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR2V5PN/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>) is mainly for removing and installing 6-bolt rotors or a super-fast axle swap, but the adjustable torque makes it great anytime you have a lot of bolts to thread in or out… just set it light, then snug things up with a torque wrench to finish the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Amazon Echo Show 8</strong> <strong>3rd gen</strong> ($149 from Amazon) is a nearly perfect workshop companion. Play music with spatial audio while you’re prepping, detailing, and tuning, then check the weather before you head out so you’re sure to have everything you need. But the best part is the screen. Pull up YouTube and find the exact repair video you need to watch, then pause and play hands-free while you follow along! And when you drink that last <a href=\"https://10barrel.com/beer/rock-hop/\">Rock Hop IPA</a>, just tell Alexa to add more to your grocery list!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Under $200</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars.jpg\" alt=\"best holiday gift ideas for a bicycle mechanic under 200 dollars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars-297x81.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars-800x218.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars-120x33.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars-768x209.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-200-dollars-1536x419.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for the gift of community, most local shops offer maintenance classes or <strong>Park Tool School</strong> during the winter months. These classes will teach you the ins and outs of bike repair in the comfort of your local shop. Perfect for the home wrench that has the tools and could use some hands-on instruction. Plus, this is a great way to keep involved in your local bike community and meet new riding buddies, making it one of the best gifts for bike mechanics – or aspiring bike mechanics alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the rider that loves a personal touch, nothing says professional like the<strong> Silca Custom HX One Essential Kit </strong>($150 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F169851%2Fsilca-hx-one-home-essential-kit&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a>).

The <strong>Kendal Ultra Sonic Cleaner</strong> ($198 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J4468J0/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>) is the easiest way to do this, and it has enough space for a chain, cogs, and disassembled derailleur pulleys.

There’s extra storage below for chains, pads, lube, and everything else you need to carry. Plus, the Prepstation Case stacks neatly in a small package for easy storage in the garage.

The <strong>California Air Tools ultra-quiet air compressor </strong>($290 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N528213/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>) is just enough power to seat those tough beads and top off your tires. It’s oil-free, easy to move, and super quiet, an excellent tool for the home mechanic. We have one of these at one of the Bikerumor offices, and it gets a workout on a regular basis – it even survived a lightning strike, while a laptop that was plugged into the same outlet sadly, did not.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1572\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-over-250-dollars-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Best gifts for bike mechanics over $250\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-over-250-dollars-copy.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-over-250-dollars-copy-297x233.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-over-250-dollars-copy-800x629.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-over-250-dollars-copy-120x94.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-over-250-dollars-copy-768x604.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-over-250-dollars-copy-1536x1207.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a stand that will travel with you and doesn’t compromise on sturdiness, the <strong>Feedback Sports Pro Mechanic Repair Stand</strong> ($395 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=7185&amp;ctc=gjspbrspcompetitivecyclistq423&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffeedback-sports-pro-mechanic-bicycle-repair-stand%3Favad%3D293233_a34246831%26SharedId%3D293233_a34246831%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_source%3Dgearjunkie.com%26utm_campaign%3DCustom%2BLink%26utm_term%3DContent\" target=\"_blank\">Competitive Cyclist</a>*) is a great option. Formerly known as the Pro Elite mobile work stand, the newly named Pro Mechanic bicycle repair stand gets a new one-handed metal spinner knob for quickly fine-tuning the tension of the clamp. You’ll still find their red Speed Ratchet button, and a larger tri-knob to tighten the clamp body. There’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/feedback-upgrades-renames-pro-mechanic-lightweight-mobile-bike-repair-stand/\">more to the update</a>, but all you need to know is that this lightweight ultra-packable stand is the perfect repair companion at home, on the race circuit, and in the garage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like to wash your bike (who doesn’t?!), the <strong>Muc Off Pressure Washer </strong>($320 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F179660%2Fmuc-off-bicycle-pressure-washer-bundle&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a>) is the next best thing to having a World Cup wash station at your house. It has just enough pressure (1450psi) to blast off all the dirt and oil without damaging your finish or seals. The bicycle-specific wash tips help with chain, frame, and tire cleaning. The foaming feature is like nothing you’ll see outside of a car wash and is just what the doctor ordered for super muddy cyclocross bike cleanup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s the best way to kick back after a job well done? A beer!  The <strong>Home Kegerator by Square Keg</strong> ($289 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WNKG5TN/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>) will deliver a crisp victory beer after a hard ride – or an emotional support beer after routing cables through a tricky aero frame. Either way, the Home Kegerator is a fun add-on for your home bike shop (as long as your local breweries will fill a growler, they should have no problem filling this).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only home wrench option for those that require the best is the <strong>Abbey Bike Tool Team Issue Toolbox </strong>($1600 from <a href=\"https://www.abbeybiketools.com/collections/best-sellers/products/team-issue-toolbox-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Abbey Bike Tools</a>). This uber-professional level took kit comes with everything you need (case included) to wrench in style. The Abbey Bike Tools Team Issue Toolbox is one of the top tool kits on the market, and any home or professional mechanic would be ecstatic to unwrap this over the holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*<em>Denotes sponsored placement</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-people-who-work-on-bicycles/\">The Best Gifts for Bike Mechanics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"428aa1171ba35ff6c15d08332cce149c30cba4657b0fa54b0c1ab8509e088d05","category":"Cycling"}
