Like many corporate sites, it also linked old blog posts from its home page, including <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240315021936/https://kubient.com/ad-fraud/how-to-create-a-world-free-of-fraud-kubients-secret-sauce/\">a May 2022 post</a> on \"How to create a world free of fraud: Kubient's secret sauce.\"</p>\n<p>These days, Kubient's website cannot be reached, the team is no more, and CEO Paul Roberts is <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ceo-kubient-inc-sentenced-prison-connection-accounting-fraud-scheme\">due to serve one year and one day in prison</a>, having pled guilty Thursday to creating his own small world of fraud.

Kubient and this firm would each bill the other for nearly identical amounts, with Kubient purportedly deploying KAI to find instances of ad fraud in the other company's ad spend.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/ceo-of-ai-ad-tech-firm-pledging-world-free-of-fraud-sentenced-for-fraud/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/ceo-of-ai-ad-tech-firm-pledging-world-free-of-fraud-sentenced-for-fraud/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9b040dba042bc117770ea386193bdeba79ecab96c379d3248d020294ca2e7da","category":"Tech"}
