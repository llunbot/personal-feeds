team-mate, Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, are riding what appears to be a prototype Pinarello mountain bike wrapped in a camouflage paintjob.</p>\n<p>Both riders were spotted riding the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country bike</a> at the Guéret round of the MTB French Cup.</p>\n<p>Pidcock used it for both the XCC (short-track) and XCO races, while Ferrand-Prevot started her season in the women’s XCO event ahead of the opening UCI World Cup race of the season in Nové Město, Czech Republic, on 12-14 May.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we know so far about Pidcock and Ferrand-Prevot’s new cross-country bike.</p>\n<h2>It replaces Tom Pidcock’s BMC Fourstroke</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tom Pidcock rode an unbranded BMC Fourstroke to victory at the Tokyo Olympic Games.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Michael Steele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Pinarello is the bike sponsor of Ineos Grenadiers and hasn’t made a cross-country mountain bike <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-enter-mtb-market-wtih-dogma-xc/\">since it launched the Dogma XC in 2012</a>.</p>\n<p>With no bike to ride contractually, Pidcock has chosen to ride an unbranded BMC Fourstroke for the past two seasons, including for his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tom-pidcock-bmc-fourstroke/\">Tokyo 2021 Olympic win</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pidcock and Pauline Ferrand-Prevot are now riding an unreleased Pinarello cross-country mountain bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>Pinarello presumably wasn’t too happy about this arrangement, with the production of this bike rumoured since last year.</p>\n<p>The new cross-country bike will enable the brand to provide for all of Pidcock’s racing, giving the multi-faceted man every opportunity to win on a Pinarello frame.</p>\n<h2>There’s a top-tube mounted shock and flex-stay suspension</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike uses a flex-stay suspension system.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>The new bike has the rear shock positioned under the top tube, which is the current trend for cross-country bikes because it enables two <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bottle-cages/\">bottle cages</a> to be fitted inside the front triangle.</p>\n<p>Brands such as Specialized have gone as far as developing a new ‘skinny’ shock alongside RockShox to sit within the top tube for the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-epic-world-cup/\">Specialized Epic World Cup</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pidcock and Ferrand-Prevot were spotted on the new bike at the Guéret round of the MTB French Cup.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>Pinarello doesn’t appear to have gone this far, instead using an external top tube mount with a skeletal construction for possible weight savings.</p>\n<p>The bike uses a yoke-style rear linkage, and the lack of pivot bearings in the rear triangle suggests it relies on the flex stays to provide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Flex-stay suspension has been seen before on cross-country bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>This concept has been seen before on cross-country bikes, with Cannondale’s Scalpel providing 100mm of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s not known how much travel Pinarello’s system will provide, but the trend for longer-travel bikes on ever-more technical courses doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2023-orbea-oiz-m-team-review/\">Orbea’s new Oiz </a>features 120mm of rear suspension.</p>\n<p>A mysterious triangle section around the bottom bracket looks similar to the air tank for the automatic dropper post on BMC’s Fourstroke – though the bike is specced with a traditional <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a>.</p>\n<h2>Pinarello is developing an integrated handlebar and stem</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The top of the stem has a mount for a bike computer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike’s integrated handlebar is branded MOST, which is Pinarello’s in-house component label and appears to feature an integrated computer mount on the top of the stem portion.</p>\n<p>While the front of Pidcock and Ferrand-Prevot’s bikes are largely obscured by race numbers, images from the rear of the bike show how the integrated cable routing feeds the cables/hydraulic hoses into the frame from the underside of the stem.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The gear and brake cables appear to enter the handlebars from the front of the stem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>While integrated cable routing makes a bike look cleaner, it also reduces the chance of pulling a cable out when crashing or jostling for places. On the other hand, maintenance is more involved because you need to bleed the brakes every time you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-service-a-headset-and-replace-headset-bearings/\">service or replace a headset bearing</a>.</p>\n<p>The integrated bars are yet to be released and do not feature on Pinarello’s website.</p>\n<h2>SR Suntour’s wireless suspension continues to hide in plain sight</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SR Suntour’s electronic suspension system has been in development for the past two years.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike appears to be using SR Suntour’s prototype electronically controlled suspension system for the suspension fork and rear shock. Pidcock has employed this since the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.</p>\n<p>Little is known about the unreleased system, but it’s likely to be broadly similar to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-flight-attendant/\">RockShox’s Flight Attendant</a>, which actively adjusts the suspension’s settings to firm up the bike for pedalling efficiency and maximises the travel for extra grip on descents.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The fork looks to be an evolution of SR Suntour’s Axon cross-country fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>The fork looks to be an evolution of SR Suntour’s Axon cross-country fork, featuring a carbon crown, with the rear shock appearing to use SR Suntour Edge externals.</p>\n<p>While we don’t know the travel of the fork, the existing SR Suntour Axon comes in 100mm, 110mm and 120mm travel options.</p>\n\n<h2>There’s a new Princeton CarbonWorks wheelset, too</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> These prototypes could be Princeton’s first mountain-bike specific wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>The new bike rolls on a pair of prototype <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in</a> Princeton CarbonWorks wheels, wrapped in Continental RaceKing tyres.</p>\n<p>Princeton CarbonWorks offers a range of road, gravel and disc wheels, used by Ineos Grenadiers since 2021, but this would be the US brand’s first <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-wheels/\">mountain bike wheel</a>.</p>\n<p>The new wheelset features Princeton’s signature variable-depth rim profile that is claimed to reduce weight and add strength without sacrificing aero performance. It’s not known what the internal rim width of these wheels will be.</p>\n<p>Pidcock has been running a tyre with a 2.2in width at the rear, though the frame looks able to handle the more aggressive 2.4in size now increasingly common on the latest XC bikes.</p>\n<h2>It looks like a Pinarello</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike features design cues from other Pinarello bikes</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>The new bike follows Pinarello’s new design language, with a sweeping top tube kink that is similar to the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-x-series/\">new comfort-oriented X-Series endurance bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-nytro-2023/\">Nytro e-road bike</a>, launched in March.</p>\n<p>Beyond aesthetics, we’re not sure what the design feature does on this bike, if anything – but regardless, it marks it out as a Pinarello.</p>\n<h2>When will it be released?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Beneath the camo wrap, the bike looks far away from a production model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>Quite simply, we don’t know. We have asked Pinarello for comment and will update this article if we hear back.</p>\n<p>However, with the World Cup season due to begin in May, and the next Olympic Games around the corner in 2024, a release this summer is likely.</p>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b296cf152b7fc29776c48038b7241017ca83e1ab2c24c6bd0f5c1fb51883ab99","category":"Cycling"}
