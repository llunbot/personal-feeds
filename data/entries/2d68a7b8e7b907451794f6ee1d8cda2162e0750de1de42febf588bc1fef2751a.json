{"title":"Twitter Is Threatening to Sue Meta Over Threads, Meta Executives Threaten to Piss Their Pants Laughing","link":"https://www.semafor.com/article/07/06/2023/twitter-is-threatening-to-sue-meta-over-threads","date":1688695899000,"content":"\n<p>Max Tani, reporting for Semafor:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Wednesday, Instagram parent company Meta introduced Threads, a\ntext-based companion to Instagram that resembles Twitter and other\ntext-based social platforms. Just hours later, a lawyer for\nTwitter, Alex Spiro, sent <a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ifn0l6bs/production/27109f01431939c8177d408d3c9848c3b46632cd.pdf\">a letter</a> to Meta CEO Mark\nZuckerberg accusing the company of engaging in “systematic,\nwillful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets\nand other intellectual property.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good luck with that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Spiro accused Meta of hiring dozens of former Twitter employees\nwho “had and continue to have access to Twitter’s trade secrets\nand other highly confidential information.”</p>\n\n<p>He also alleged that Meta assigned those employees to develop\n“Meta’s copycat ‘Threads’ app with the specific intent that they\nuse Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property in\norder to accelerate the development of Meta’s competing app, in\nviolation of both state and federal law as well as those\nemployees’ ongoing obligations to Twitter.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s comical to think that Meta needed engineers from Twitter to build Threads. Like Twitter is a model of reliability and stability, and Meta’s platforms don’t serve an entire order of magnitude more users. Even more comical:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Andy Stone, Meta’s communications director, told Semafor that\nTwitter’s accusations are baseless. “No one on the Threads\nengineering team is a former Twitter employee — that’s just not a\nthing,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if ex-Twitter employees <em>were</em> working on Threads, Elon Musk fired them. It’s not illegal to hire people fired by a competitor. Would be kind of wacky if it were. This letter is so transparent: Musk is threatened by Threads and jealous of the mountain of media attention it’s getting, so he’s lashing out. Commanding his lawyer to send a silly letter like this feels like a Trump move, no exaggeration.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/twitter-threatens-suit-over-threads\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2d68a7b8e7b907451794f6ee1d8cda2162e0750de1de42febf588bc1fef2751a","category":"Tech"}
