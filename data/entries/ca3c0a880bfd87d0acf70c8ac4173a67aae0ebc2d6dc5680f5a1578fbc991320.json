The report led to hopes that Apple might also use the chip to revive its line of AirPort routers, which were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/apple-officially-discontinues-airport-wireless-router-lineup/\">discontinued in 2018</a>, but those dreams have been dashed by Gurman himself.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Apple-AirPort-Routers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" />\r<br />\nIn his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-22/apple-explores-amazon-ring-doorbell-competitor-with-face-id-airpods-heart-rate\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, the well-connected journalist said that Apple is \"not\" currently working on new AirPort routers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman did offer a glimmer of hope. He said that Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chip is \"so sophisticated\" that it could \"theoretically\" turn a home device like a future Apple TV or HomePod into a wireless access point. However, he did not confirm if Apple will actually follow through with that idea, so keep your expectations low for the time being.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's in-house Wi-Fi chip could still have other benefits for the next Apple TV and HomePod mini models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/2025-apple-tv-rumored-features/\">including Wi-Fi 6E support</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-not-working-on-new-airport-routers/\">Apple 'Not' Working on New AirPort, But Apple TV and HomePod Provide Glimmer of Hope</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-not-working-on-new-airport-but-apple-tv-and-homepod-provide-glimmer-of-hope.2445928/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ca3c0a880bfd87d0acf70c8ac4173a67aae0ebc2d6dc5680f5a1578fbc991320","category":"Apple"}
