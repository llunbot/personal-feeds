This all-new model is Yeti’s first lightweight eMTB, and it fills a gap in the brand’s lineup between its non-electric bikes and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yeti-160e-emtb-the-first-ews-race-ready-e-bike/\">full-power 160e</a>. While it shares some similarities with its full-power sibling, the MTe has slightly less travel and a significantly lower weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 145 mm of rear travel paired with a 160 mm fork and an up-to-date all-around geometry, the MTe looks like a very versatile machine. Add the option to run full 29 or MX wheels and Yeti’s Sixfinity six-bar suspension layout with adjustable leverage ratios, and riders can further customize the ride feel. TQ’s new HPR60 motor provides a pedaling boost with minimal weight penalty, with complete bike weights starting at just over 38 pounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new MTe is currently offered in three build options with prices starting at $9,850 and topping out at an eye-watering $14,300. These bikes certainly don’t come cheap, but hey, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-and-first-rides-the-all-new-yeti-asr-xc-race-bike/\">I’ve ridden non-electric Yeti bikes</a> that cost just as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1332\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27.webp\" alt=\"Side shot of the Yeti MTe lightweight e-bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27-768x511.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_27-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The MTe uses Yeti’s six-bar Sixfinity suspension design. (all photos/Yeti)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yeti MTe Frame Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With 145 mm of rear travel and a 160 mm fork, the MTe slots nicely into the do-it-all trail bike category. That’s enough travel to take on just about any terrain that doesn’t require a full-blown enduro bike. Like the full-power 160e, the MTe eschews Yeti’s Switch Infinity suspension design in favor of the new Sixfinity six-bar configuration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MTe comes in Yeti’s high-end Turq carbon frame only. Yeti says the frame is reinforced with Vectran plies, adding impact resistance, strength, and “DH toughness.” The compact TQ-HPR60 drive unit is barely noticeable in the frame and, along with the slim TQ batteries housed in the downtube, hides its e-bike-ness fairly well. The downtube guard provides frame protection as well as access to cables and the battery compartment. The TQ display is integrated into the top tube of the frame.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11.webp\" alt=\"The TQ display in the top tube of the Yet MTe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_11-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>TQ’s new display integrates nicely into the top tube of the frame.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MTe is sold with 29-inch wheels front and rear, but it is mixed-wheel compatible. Flip chips in the upper seat stay junction preserve the bike’s geometry when switching between rear wheel sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All cables are routed internally with secure cable ports and options to run mechanical or wireless drivetrains. The MTe also has an integrated fender to protect the Sixfinity switch link, along with molded chainstay protection and a custom chainguide. A set of mounts on the downtube can attach a bottle cage or the optional range extender. An additional accessory mount under the top tube offers a spot to mount tools or tubes on the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MTe comes in four frame sizes, S-XL, and is claimed to fit riders between a recommended height range of 5’1” and 6’7”. All builds come in your choice of classic Yeti Turquoise or Midnight (black).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yeti MTe Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO.webp\" alt=\"The Yeti MTe geometry chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-GEO-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeti gave the new MTe a geometry that is mostly in line with modern trends. The 64-degree head tube angle speaks to its all-around intentions, while the 77-degree seat tube angle should prop the rider up nicely above the cranks while climbing. Reach numbers grow from 430 mm to 505 mm across the size range, with a fairly standard 480 mm on the large frame. The one thing that appears a bit out of place is the 449 mm chainstay length across all sizes. While that seems reasonable for the larger frame sizes, it looks pretty long for the smaller frames on paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"the anti-squat graph for the Yeti MTe bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-SQUAT.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"The anti-rise graph for the Yeti MTe bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-ANTI-RISE.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Anti-squat and anti-rise charts.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sixfinity Suspension</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sixfinity suspension layout makes it easier to fit electric bike components on a frame compared to Yeti’s Switch Infinity system. It also allowed Yeti to tune the suspension characteristics to suit the MTe’s weight and power. According to Yeti, “we tune pedaling efficiency at sag to maintain the same parabolic curves seen with Switch Infinity. The curves are then scaled inversely to the MTe’s electric assist.” Based on the anti-squat chart provided, it looks very supportive at sag before dropping off quickly further into the travel. Anti-rise appears to be relatively consistent throughout its travel to “strike the ideal balance between traction and geometry preservation when braking,” according to Yeti.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE.webp\" alt=\"The adjustable leverage rate graph for the Yeti MTe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_YETI_CYCLES_MTe_MEDIA-KIT-SUSPENSION-LEVERAGE-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With 4 lower shock mount positions, riders can adjust the progression of the rear suspension.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Adjustable Leverage Rate</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the 160e, the MTe also has flip chips in the lower shock mount that allow riders to fine-tune the leverage rate/progression of the rear suspension. Two sets of flip chips provide a total of four distinct settings, ranging between 12% and 25% progression. This gives riders the opportunity to adjust the rear suspension progression to their riding style, terrain, or preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>TQ-HPR60 Drive Unit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12.webp\" alt=\"The TQ-HPR60 motor on the Yeti MTe bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_12-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The TQ-HPR60 is lightweight and so small that it’s barely noticeable.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MTe is the very first eMTB released using the brand-new TQ motor. You can learn more about this <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tq-new-light-weight-hpr60-e-bike-motor-yeti-ebike/\">new motor in our recent launch coverage</a>, but here’s the quick rundown. The HPR60 builds off the success of its predecessor, the HPR50, boosting power and torque while maintaining the same low weight and compact form factor. The HPR60 gets a 20% boost in torque up to 60 Nm, along with a 17% increase in peak power to 350 W. It’s still one of the lightest and smallest motors available, helping to keep the weight of the MTe impressively low.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Batteries</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When TQ launched the new HPR60, it included two new battery sizes for a total of three options. This gives bike brands and riders more options to choose from, whether that’s prioritizing the lightest weight or longest range. Yeti uses two different-sized batteries across the three MTe build options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-of-the-line T4 comes with the lightweight 290 Wh battery, helping to keep the claimed weight down to an impressive 38.7 pounds. The T3 and C2 builds come with longer-range and slightly heavier 580 Wh batteries. Riders can also purchase the optional range extender to add 160 Wh of juice for longer rides.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20.webp\" alt=\"removing the battery from the Yeti MTe bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YETI_MTe_Bike_Check_LowRes_20-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The TQ batteries come in three sizes and are removable.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yeti MTe Build Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the MTe comes in a total of three builds, all of which are based around the same Turq carbon fiber frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Yeti MTe C2 Eagle 90 Transmission</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The C2 Eagle 90 build is the entry point to the MTe, but at $9,850, it’s quite far from being budget-friendly.
