We apologize for missing last week, but both Stephen and I were in transit to South Texas for the Starship launch.

Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer and astrophysicist at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the US Space Force data had cataloged two new objects in an orbital plane consistent with the launch from North Korea at the time stated by Pyongyang.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986054#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986054&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"409a0a8df266952d307c81f44e4fc047b578676a50c1db1383a1ecee225d3bfd","category":"Tech"}
