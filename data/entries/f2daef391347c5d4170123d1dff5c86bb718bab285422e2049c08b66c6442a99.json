Among laws that Facebook's terms allegedly conflict with are the First Amendment, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), as well as California’s Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA) and state privacy laws.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037632#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037632&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f2daef391347c5d4170123d1dff5c86bb718bab285422e2049c08b66c6442a99","category":"Tech"}
