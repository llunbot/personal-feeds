Retailing at $69.99 USD, these are a relatively cheap option for rim protection, certainly in comparison to the likes of Rimpact PRO and CushCore PRO. But, are they any good?</p><p>We put them to the test on our local trails in the Tweed Valley, Scotland. Our trails aren’t particularly well endowed with rock gardens, but that’s not to say they’re by any means lacking in square-edged hit potential. To make sure we were giving the insert a thorough testing, tire pressures were dropped way below our usual 21 PSI. Here’s how we got on.</p><h2>Review: Nukeproof ARD</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof ard 27.5&quot; actual weight\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060446/nukeproof-ard-275-insert-actual-weight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The 27.5″ Nukeproof ARD tire insert we tested weighed in at 152g (probably a bit less, didn’t weigh the cable ties). That’s one of the lighter ones we’ve tested so far, at least 100g lighter than <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/12/review-cushcore-pro-inserts-allow-crazy-low-tire-pressures-for-ultimate-grip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CushCore Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/09/16/review-rockstop-mtb-tire-inserts-are-super-easy-to-fit-offer-good-rim-protection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RockStop</a>. Off to a good start. The insert is made up of a single piece of closed cell foam that is shipped as a continuous loop. It is also shipped with the necessary tire insert compatible tubeless valves that allow sealant and air to flow freely, unhindered by the presence of the insert. These weigh 4.5g each.</p><div id=\"attachment_275423\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275423\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof ard cutaway profile against rim\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19151228/nukeproof-ard-cutaway-section-on-rim-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275423\">A cutaway profile of the Nukeproof ARD tire insert sat against a Nukeproof Horizon V2 rim (30mm internal width)</p></div><p>The ARD insert is recommended for rim widths from 19mm up to 35mm.

It is quite firm to touch, though not quite as firm as CushCore Pro or RockStop inserts. Compressing the foam, it rebounds to its original shape fairly quickly, though not immediately; an imprint is visible for a few seconds after the initial compression.</p><h3>Fitting the Nukeproof ARD</h3><p>The Nukeproof ARD tire insert was set up on the rear wheel only, with a Nukeproof Horizon V2 rim (30mm internal width) and a Michelin Wild Enduro Rear. I never look forward to installing a tire insert, though I have to say, this one isn’t as tight a fit as others I’ve tried. As I would with a regular tubeless setup, I initially put one bead on the rim first. I then fit the ARD insert loosely inside the tire, positioning it onto the rim as I worked around it.</p><p>You then fit the second tire bead. This is the key bit. As you push the bead onto the rim, you want to make sure you push the bead underneath the ARD insert so that, when you come to popping the last section of bead onto the rim, there’s enough slack in the tire. Even doing that, I did have to use a tire lever for that last bit, but I’m sure there are plenty of folk out there who would pop it on easily by hand.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"attachment_275280\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275280\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof ard tire insert on dt swiss rim\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060453/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-on-dt-swiss-e1900-alloy-rim-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275280\">Shown here on a DT SWISS E 1900 alloy rim for illustrative purposes only; actually tested on a Nukeproof Horizon V2 rim</p></div><p>The tire insert compatible valves these are supplied with mean you don’t <em>necessarily</em> have to pour sealant into the tire beforehand. You can just inject it through the valve stem after you’ve fitted the tire. Personally, I’d dissuade you from doing that. The ARD insert lacks channels to allow sealant to pass freely from one side of the tire to the other, or from underneath the insert to the space above it.</p><p>I found I had to use a lot more sealant than I would for a regular tubeless setup, and more than I’ve used for setting up other brands’ tire inserts too (though probably not 100g worth). I put this down to the fact that the sealant wasn’t able to flow freely around the tire. You might be able to get around this by pouring a little sealant into the tire before pushing the final portion of bead onto the rim.</p><p>Is the ARD absorbing the sealant? No. The closed cell foam it is made of is non-absorbent. That said, there is always some sealant that is lost to the surface area of the insert. I would argue that the rough surface of the ARD insert likely harbors marginally more sealant than the smooth surface of CushCore.</p><h4>On the Trail</h4><div id=\"attachment_275283\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275283\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions.jpg\" alt=\"nukeproof ard tire insert test conditions\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19060654/nukeproof-ard-tire-insert-test-conditions-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275283\">Credit: Finlay Anderson</p></div><p>I tested the Nukeproof ARD on the rear wheel only, running it on my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/06/15/revel-bikes-mixes-up-some-tang-a-bit-of-red-dirt-for-new-rail-rascal-paint-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revel Rail</a> enduro bike. I rode it for a three week period on my local enduro trails, recently host to the 2021 EWS season finale. These trails aren’t littered with the most challenging features for a tire insert, granted.

It’s not as noticeable as the rattle from the RockStop insert, but it is there, nevertheless. I won’t hold the rattle against it though; every insert I’ve ever ridden has rattled, the quietest being the CushCore Pro, likely because it has the tightest fit.</p><p>At 21 PSI, it was also evident that I probably wasn’t testing the insert to its full potential. To ensure the tire was bottoming out on to the ARD insert more frequently, I dropped the rear tire pressure to 17 PSI. That harsh, sharp feeling you feel through your feet when rim bottoms out on the tire was replaced by more of a dull thud; evidence of the ARD insert absorbing the impact and damping vibration.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"attachment_269075\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-269075\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner.jpg\" alt=\"michelin wild enduro front tire review gum-x3d compound wet riding conditions bermed corner\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23124151/Michelin-Wild-Enduro-review-leaning-bike-wet-trail-corner-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-269075\">Credit: Finlay Anderson</p></div><p>In corners, I felt no evidence of the tire rolling, despite those lower pressures.

It certainly stiffens up the side walls, as you can feel its presence underneath the tire wall when you give it a squeeze.</p><div id=\"attachment_263528\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-263528\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner.jpg\" alt=\"leatt 8.0 dh helmet composite shell\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30124211/leatt-8-carbon-dh-helmet-profit-comfort-liner-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-263528\">Credit: Finlay Anderson</p></div><p>Removing the ARD insert after 3 weeks of use (which likely amounted to around 25 hours of ride time) I inspected it to find no evidence of any damage, either to the V2 Horizon rim or the ARD insert itself. I remained puncture free throughout the test period. Overall, the ARD insert performed well.</p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>Nukeproof ARD inserts are available for 27.5″ and 29″ wheel sizes, retailing at $69.99 USD per pair.
