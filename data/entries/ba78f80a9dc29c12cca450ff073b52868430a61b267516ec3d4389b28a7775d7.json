The Norco DH team rode them all week, and for the finals, The Santa Cruz Syndicate used them for the beginning of the week but not at the final because course conditions had improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photos were hard to come by, hence the weird angles and cropping, but here’s what we can tell so far…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12.jpg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, we thought it might be a more aggressive High Roller II, but after some more thought, this could be a new design altogether. We’ll have to keep an eye out on the pros’ bikes and see where it goes. This prototype’s center blocks are more square, whereas the HRII has wider, rectangular knobs. Here it is for reference:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire.jpg\"><img width=\"2221\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire.jpg\" alt=\"maxxis high roller 2 mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire.jpg 2221w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-297x267.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-800x720.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-120x108.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-768x692.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-1536x1383.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-2048x1844.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Current Maxxis High Roller II Photo: Maxxis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big difference is the leading edge. The Maxxis High Roller II’s center treads are ramped with a long slope, helping it roll quickly. The side knobs are tall and angular, which makes this one a great rear tire when paired with something more aggressive in the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10.jpg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have flat backs on the knobs for good braking traction. This new DH prototype’s side knobs are straighter, with edges running parallel to the rolling direction rather than at slight and alternating angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The center blocks also stay in line, suggesting it could be a new Shorty with each other rather than the High Rollers II alternating wide/small pattern. Both have wide open spacing between the knobs, suggesting this DH prototype is also intended for loose conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11.jpg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no word on specs yet, but we suspect it’ll have the same DoubleDown and Downhill casing options as others in the Maxxis DH line. It’ll likely also get various single, double, 3C MaxxTerra, MaxxGrip, and SuperTacky compound options. <strong><em>Why? </em></strong>Because we could see this pairing really well with the High Roller II as a front/rear combo. That said, the Minion DHR II tire has a similar tread pattern to the High Roller II, so perhaps this one’s intentionally different to help give it its own personality and position in its lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.maxxis.com\" target=\"_blank\">Maxxis.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spotted-maxxis-high-roller-iii-makes-the-dh-rounds/\">Spotted!
