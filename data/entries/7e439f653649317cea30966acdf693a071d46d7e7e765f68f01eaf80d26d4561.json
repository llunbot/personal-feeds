{"title":"Apple Discontinuing Apple Pay Later, Just 8 Months After Rolling Out to Countries Other Than  the U.S.","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/17/apple-pay-later-united-states-ending/","date":1718670688000,"content":"\n<p>Apple, in a statement to 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to\naccess installment loans offered through credit and debit cards,\nas well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay. With the\nintroduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will\nno longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S. Our focus continues to\nbe on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private\npayment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us\nto bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across\nthe globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and\nlenders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This always seemed a like weird offering from Apple. Apple Pay Later did not charge interest, which is great, but it still seemed contrary to the spirit of helping people develop good financial habits.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/17/apple-pay-never\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e439f653649317cea30966acdf693a071d46d7e7e765f68f01eaf80d26d4561","category":"Tech"}
