It is designed to be charged via USB-C, and can be powered up using the same adapter included with the MacBook Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe battery will power the headset for approximately two hours, and it will be able to be swapped out for continuous usage while a second battery charges. Given the short battery life, the presumption is that Apple will offer additional battery packs for sale separately.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's headset is rumored to be called \"Reality One\" or \"Reality Pro\" and is expected to debut at WWDC in June, along with xrOS, Apple's new mixed-reality operating system.
