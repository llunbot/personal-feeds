While social media apps will \"always\" be a focus for Meta, it has been limiting to have a \"brand that is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything we're doing today, let alone in the future,\" he said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808540#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808540&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d83fa0f7b99f7197f4a4e7a446c08797f964f9660582b7b7c543e30d8d0a74d8","category":"Tech"}
