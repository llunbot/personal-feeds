The aging Russian satellite was at an altitude of about 480 km, amidst a fairly congested environment of commercial and government satellites.</p>\n<p>The kinetic blast appears to have sent debris from the satellite across a broad range of altitudes.Â Based upon initial data, a space situational awareness firm named SpaceNav <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceNav2/status/1460801178015571974\">calculated that</a> some of the largest pieces of debris have already reached altitudes from as high as 1,100 km and as low as 300 km above the Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813740#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813740&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"96cb001af7e54bb86287b190cde64883c8a3afd15f665c4742a9f5b33b7701da","category":"Tech"}
