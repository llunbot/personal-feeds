In a tweet today, the leaker said they finally independently confirmed this information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iPhone-15-Pro-Periscope-Mock-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nLast month, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reiterated that the periscope lens will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/iphone-15-pro-max-5-6x-optical-zoom/\">enable up to 5x-6x optical zoom</a> when shooting photos with the rear camera on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, compared to up to 3x on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. When taking a photo, optical zoom does not have any blurriness when zooming in, like digital zoom does.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a periscope lens, light absorbed by the image sensor is bent or \"folded,\" allowing for a greater distance between the camera elements within the compact design of a smartphone. This technology allows for increased optical zoom and is already used by some Android brands like Samsung, Google, and Huawei, with phones like the Pixel 7 Pro and Galaxy S23 Ultra offering between 5x and 10x optical zoom.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will launch the iPhone 15 Pro Max in September. Other upcoming models, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro, are not expected to feature a periscope lens.
