It’s one of the best-known climbs in the world, and a Tour de France institution. If it’s not on your big climb bucket list, chances are that’s because you’ve already been up it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We certainly didn’t waste much time ourselves in heading for its hallowed slopes in the early days of <em>Cyclist</em> magazine. Issue 12 back in 2013 saw our first pilgrimage for a Big Ride on Alpe d’Huez, and we returned three years later for a gravel ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the eight years and more than 100 Big Rides since then, we haven’t been back – until now. Maybe it’s because there are just so many other fantastic places around the world to ride a bike (and subscribers can take their pick by heading to our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/rides\">Cyclist Rides</a> site for our full Big Ride and Classic Climb archive). Whatever the reason, the point is our September 2024 issue sees us make a long-overdue return to the 21 Bends.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpe d'Huez\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/big-ride-sarenne-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alpe d’Huez’s switchbacks as seen from the Route de la Confession.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s no coincidence either, because next month Alpe d’Huez will make its first appearance in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a>, and not just as a summit finish but as the final act of the entire race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the final act of our Big Ride too, but unlike the pros our ride also begins in Alpe d’Huez too, and even features part of the climb mid-way through as well – just in case it’s another 100 issues before we return.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/new-issue-ramsay.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alpe d’Huez’s place in pro cycling history is well established. Belgium’s KOERS Museum, which we visit this month in the first instalment of a new series, is a place all <em>about </em>pro cycling history, featuring a series of exhibits paying tribute to the sport’s past. You’ll find Tour de France bikes dating a full century apart, helmets and jerseys from across the decades, postcards, memorabilia and more… each item a small part of the overall narrative that has shaped this remarkable sport over the years.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/new-issue-koers-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/new-issue-koers-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/new-issue-koers-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/new-issue-koers-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/new-issue-koers-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/new-issue-koers-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/new-issue-koers.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And if you’re looking for a narrative, you’ll enjoy our chat with Scottish former champion Ramsay Mackay.
