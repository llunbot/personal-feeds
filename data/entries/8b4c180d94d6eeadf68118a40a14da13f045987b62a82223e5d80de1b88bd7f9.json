{"title":"Get ready for WWDC with this off-the-wall skit Apple didn’t want you to see","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2359462/wwdc-skit-larry-david-app-approval-unaired.html","date":1717756200000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Way back in 2014, there were rumors that Apple had produced one of its trademark WWDC intro skits that never aired. It involved Larry David, app approval, a “Spicy Godfather” sandwich, racial humor, and Evan Spiegel—and Apple apparently got cold feet and showed a fairly standard video about what developers look like instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it’s kind of amazing Apple even considered showing it to the world considering Larry tells JB Smoove, “No smacks for Blacks,” and there’s a running joke about how indiscriminate the App Store approval process is.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not to say it’s not funny—it’s actually very funny. It’s just not the kind of thing you’d expect to see in a WWDC keynote, and clearly someone at Apple agreed since it’s been in the vault for a decade. It’s not clear how the YouTube account got its hands on the video, but the video is presented in its entirety—a full 10 minutes, which is likely much longer than Apple would have shown. But even if it’s a little lengthy, it’s definitely worth a watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will kick off <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> with a keynote at 10 am on Monday. It is expected to unveil numerous AI features including integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But we doubt Larry David will make an appearance.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8b4c180d94d6eeadf68118a40a14da13f045987b62a82223e5d80de1b88bd7f9","category":"Apple"}
