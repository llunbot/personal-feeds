The team has thus missed an initial deadline to file its paperwork, but it would still be able to apply – as was the case last November – should management succeed in resolving the squad’s financial issues.</p><p>“We are actively engaged with potential partners, and our current partners, as we work to secure our future for 2022,” Ryder said in a statement.</p><p>Less than four months ago, the then-Qhubeka-Assos team announced that it had <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/qhubeka-assos-becomes-qhubeka-nexthash-with-lengthy-new-sponsorship-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">signed a deal with NextHash</a>, a parent company that owns several entities using blockchain technology. NextHash immediately took over as a co-title sponsor. Assos, which had effectively saved the team at the end of 2020 with its sponsorship commitment, remained on as a kit sponsor.</p><p>CyclingTips <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/whats-the-story-behind-nexthash-team-qhubekas-mysterious-new-sponsor/\" target=\"_blank\">reported on various financial irregularities</a> behind NextHash in June.
