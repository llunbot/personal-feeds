The claim comes in a new book titled \"Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk and the Bet of the Century,\" as reviewed by <em><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review\">The Los Angeles Times</a></em>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/06/REC_ASA_CODE2016-20160601-205816-2745.1464846118.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the book, during a 2016 phone call between Musk and Cook that touched on the possibility of Apple purchasing Tesla, Musk told Cook that a purchase of Telsa by Apple could only go forward if he became CEO of the combined company. <blockquote>Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk are talking on the phone. The 2016 unveiling of the make-it-or-break-it Model 3 is coming soon, but Tesla is in serious financial trouble. Cook has an idea: Apple buys Tesla.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMusk is interested, but one condition: “I’m CEO.”\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSure, says Cook. When Apple bought Beats in 2014, it kept on the founders, Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNo, Musk says. Apple. Apple CEO.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n“F— you” Cook says and hangs up.</blockquote>Elon Musk has previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/22/elon-musk-tim-cook-tesla-meeting/\">claimed that he once reached out to Tim Cook</a> to \"discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla.\" Cook, according to Musk, declined to take the meeting. The new book claims that while a meeting never took place, a phone call between the two CEOs did. It is worth noting, however, that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html\">during an interview</a> with <em>The New York Times'</em> Kara Swisher in April, Cook said he had never spoken to Musk but has \"great admiration and respect\" for Tesla.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458\">In a tweet</a>, Elon Musk is denying the contents of the book, calling it both \"false and boring.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> Musk has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112\">shared another tweet</a> explicitly denying that he and Cook have ever spoken or written to each other, reiterating his statements from months ago that he had at one point requested a meeting with Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla but that Cook refused the meeting.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. <br /><br />There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. <br /><br />He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today’s value.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 30, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tesla/\">Tesla</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-wanting-to-become-apple-ceo/\">Elon Musk Reportedly Demanded to Become Apple CEO as Part of Potential Tesla Acquisition [Update: Musk Denies]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elon-musk-reportedly-demanded-to-become-apple-ceo-as-part-of-potential-tesla-acquisition-update-musk-denies.2306001/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=o5J9AaLR5MI:VW9xoajOEzY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=o5J9AaLR5MI:VW9xoajOEzY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/o5J9AaLR5MI\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1cede6a5c8404ab0cc1d8ca6bbb65cd990f6b679ec819bb304b1ccbf58e1dc46","category":"Apple"}
