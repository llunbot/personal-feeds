Inside lives the AZ2 Neural Edge CPU, which uses four cores and, according to Amazon, 22 times as many TOPS (trillions of operations per second) than the last-gen chip. The biggest difference between the AZ2 and AZ1 is the former’s ability to process machine-learning-based speech models “significantly faster,” according to Amazon’s announcement. Computer vision (CV) algorithms can be handled on the device rather than in the cloud, allowing the Echo Show 15 to handle features like visual ID and voice processing with comparatively less latency. And like the AZ1, the AZ2 can handle speech recognition and CV workloads simultaneously.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799066#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799066&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9943c29dfb99ea3cf5cc691984fe949f4593324ea88b75e437e726ebcea159e9","category":"Tech"}
