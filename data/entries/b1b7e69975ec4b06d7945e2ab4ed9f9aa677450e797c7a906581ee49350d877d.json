The update is currently in beta testing and will likely be released later this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iPod-shuffle-MacRumors-YouTube.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nFrom the release notes:<blockquote><strong>Resolved Issues</strong>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFixed an issue where iPod shuffle (3rd and 4th generation) cannot be synced due to an unknown error (-244).</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/27/apple-removes-ipod-nano-ipod-shuffle/\">discontinued the iPod shuffle in 2017</a>, so this is a niche bug fix, but it evokes nostalgia for the miniature music player. The original iPod shuffle launched in 2005 and was the first model without a screen, allowing for a more portable design and a lower $99 starting price with 512MB of storage. A 1GB model was available for $149.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"iPod shuffle is smaller and lighter than a pack of gum and costs less than $100,\" said Apple's former CEO Steve Jobs. \"With most flash-memory music players users must use tiny displays and complicated controls to find their music; with iPod shuffle you just relax and it serves up new combinations of your music every time you listen.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeyond new color options in 2012 and 2015, Apple last updated the iPod shuffle in 2010 with a square design and 2GB of storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nmacOS 13.5 will likely be one of the final updates to macOS Ventura, as Apple prepares to release macOS Sonoma later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613\">@aaronp613</a>)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239\">macOS Ventura</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/12/macos-13-5-fixes-ipod-shuffle-syncing-issue/\">macOS Ventura 13.5 Fixes iPod Shuffle Syncing Issue Years After Device Was Discontinued</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-ventura-13-5-fixes-ipod-shuffle-syncing-issue-years-after-device-was-discontinued.2395709/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b1b7e69975ec4b06d7945e2ab4ed9f9aa677450e797c7a906581ee49350d877d","category":"Apple"}
