From kinematics to anti-squat to compression ratios, there’s a lot of terminology piled on top of designs like VPP, Horst Link, CVA, DW Link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add CBF to that list and you have the suspension design and philosophy of Chris Canfield. He’s my guest today and had been designing full-suspension mountain bikes for almost 25 years.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>We talk about how things work, why multi-linkage bikes work well (as well as why some maybe don’t work as well as others), and we try, really hard, to explain brake jack and why braking forces negatively affect suspension performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after all that, we talk about not one, but <em>TWO</em> new suspension patents he’s working on that are truly wild, and he explains them publicly for the very first time, right here. You can check out his website at <a href=\"https://suspension-formulas.com\" target=\"_blank\">Suspension-Formulas.com</a>, and get the occasional sneak peek at new designs on his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/suspension_formulas/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>This episode sponsored by:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px.png\" alt=\"TPC logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px.png 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-297x62.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-800x168.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-120x25.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-768x161.png 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is the perfect time to upgrade your ride.
