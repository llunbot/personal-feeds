These features are currently available on Chrome for Android, but they’re making their iPhone debut. Here are the new features</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Google Lens: image and text search at the same time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrome on iOS can do a Google search using an image from your photo library. Google has enhanced this feature so users can add words to the visual query in order to perform specific searches. In an example provided by Google, the user can pick a picture of a snowboard to search, but then can refine the search by adding text, such as a color like “purple” and get results of purple snowboards. Google Lens can be accessed by tapping on the camera icon in the Google Search bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Save files to Google Drive and Google Photos</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"chorme ios save to google drive\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chorme-ios-save-to-google-drive.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Chrome for iOS now has the option to save files to Google Drive.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Web content can now be saved to a Google Drive or Google Photos account–you must be signed into a Google account for this to work. When saving a file from Chrome, users can tap a Google Drive option and a new “Saved from Chrome” folder is created, housing your saved files. To save images, press and hold on the image, and a pop-up menu appears with the option to “Save in Google Photos.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2><strong>Tap to see</strong> <strong>a mini-map of an address</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Starting soon,” users will be able to tap an address and view a mini-map of the location, directly in Chrome. Goggle states that this feature is in an experimental phase and will be rolled out gradually to other regions.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shopping Insight deals</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"shopping insights chrome\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shopping-insights-chrome.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Shopping Insights in Chrome for iOS.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When shopping using Chrome, if a Shopping Insight deal is available, a “Good Deal Now” notification appears and users can tap it to get details.  This feature requires users to be signed into Chrome and the “Make Searches and Browsing Better” setting enabled. Shopping Inisghts is available in the U.S., with more regions added “in the coming months.”</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"35b411f1351392e5e1d7cde8406c7545d5b443bfa801ad7ee793a83cb34d16fd","category":"Apple"}
