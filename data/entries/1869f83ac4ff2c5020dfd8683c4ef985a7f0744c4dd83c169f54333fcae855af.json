Only the bravest dare enter, knowing full well that a slight mistake can have massive consequences. Along those lines, we wish Gee Atherton a speedy recovery after a massive crash in practice. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRcun_x1aJ/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\">Gee posted on instagram</a> stating “Injuries are not too bad tho, some fractures to vertebrae and a few skull fractures will mean I’ll have to chill for a few weeks.” These guys are built different. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, that was the worst crash of the week and we saw some incredible riding by all. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bienvenido Agaudo only managed to come in 8th place, but everyone went wild when he sent a <em>massive</em> front flip over the canyon gap. <em>Twice.</em> In his first run, Aguado was so amped he couldn’t even finish his run before being overcome with emotion and celebrating mid-course. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the day belonged to the legendary Cam Zink, who stomped one of the biggest flip step-downs of his life with perfect execution to take home the win. Fast forward to 2:10:00 for the winning run, or take in the whole replay above. Emotions ran high afterward as well, as Kyle Strait sent an iconic suicide no-hander off the drop (2:30:00) after breaking his back at Rampage just a year ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2023 Red Bull Rampage results</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.
