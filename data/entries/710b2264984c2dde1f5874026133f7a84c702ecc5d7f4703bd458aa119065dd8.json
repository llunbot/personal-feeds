{"title":"Flight Tracking in Messages (and Anywhere Data Detectors Work)","link":"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/you-can-track-any-flight-directly-from-your-iphones-text-messages/","date":1720546840000,"content":"\n<p>Nelson Aguilar and Blake Stimac, writing for CNet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That’s right. There’s a hidden flight tracker built right into\niMessage that you probably would have never noticed unless you\nthrew in the right combination of details within a message. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Although the airline name/flight number format highlighted above\nis the best way to go, there are other texting options that will\nlead you to the same result. So let’s say we stick with American\nAirlines 9707, other options that may bring up the flight tracker\ninclude:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>AmericanAirlines9707</code> (no spaces)</li>\n<li><code>AmericanAirlines 9707</code> (only one space)</li>\n<li><code>AA9707</code> (airline name is abbreviated and no space)</li>\n<li><code>AA 9707</code> (abbreviated and space)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a cool feature, but don’t cancel your <a href=\"https://www.flightyapp.com/\">Flighty</a> subscription. It’s maddeningly inconsistent. Even some of CNet’s own suggestions don’t work — neither <code>AmericanAirlines1776</code> nor <code>AmericanAirlines 1776</code> works, but <code>American Airlines 9707</code> does.</p>\n\n<p>The abbreviated names work for the major U.S. airlines — <code>AA123</code> (American), <code>DL123</code> (Delta), and <code>UA123</code> (United) are all recognized. But neither <code>B6123</code> nor <code>JBU123</code> (JetBlue) work, nor <code>F9123</code> or <code>FFT123</code> (Frontier).</p>\n\n<p><code>JetBlue 123</code>, <code>JetBlue Airways 123</code>, and <code>JetBlue Airlines 123</code> work (and even <code>Jet Blue 123</code> works, with the erroneous space), but you need to include “Airlines” for most carriers. None of these work: <code>American 123</code>, <code>Delta 123</code>, <code>United 123</code>, <code>Frontier 123</code>. All of those do work if you include “Airlines” in the name.</p>\n\n<p>CNet attributes this feature to iMessage, going so far as to claim that it doesn’t work for messages sent using SMS, but that’s wrong. It works just fine for SMS messages. In fact, it’s not even a feature specific to the Messages app. It’s a feature from Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/datadetection\">DataDetection framework</a> — the same system-wide feature that recognizes calendar events, postal addresses, URLs, shipment tracking numbers, and more. So you can use this same flight-code trick with, say, Apple Mail. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/07/jetblue-data-detector.png\">It even works with text recognized in screenshots</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/09/flight-tracking-imessage\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"710b2264984c2dde1f5874026133f7a84c702ecc5d7f4703bd458aa119065dd8","category":"Tech"}
