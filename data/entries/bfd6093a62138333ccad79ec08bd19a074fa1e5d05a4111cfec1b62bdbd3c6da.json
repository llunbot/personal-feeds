A senior White House official <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-considers-slashing-china-tariffs-to-de-escalate-trade-war-6f875d69\">told The Wall Street Journal</a> that the tariffs may come \"down to between roughly 50 percent and 65 percent.\" Or perhaps the US may use a tiered approach, charging a 35 percent tax on goods that don't threaten national security, while requiring 100 percent tariffs on imports \"deemed as strategic to America’s interest,\" other insiders told the WSJ.</p>\n<p>For now, Trump is being vague, only confirming that tariffs \"won't be that high\" or \"anywhere near\" 145 percent.
