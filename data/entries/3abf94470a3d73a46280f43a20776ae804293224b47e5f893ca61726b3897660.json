Plus, if you pre-order one now, you’ll save another 20% to make sure you’re not gonna be over-torquing lightweight parts on your bike late this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fix Mfg 224 affordable, easy-to-use torque wrench</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg 224 simple affordable easy-to-use home mechanic torque wrench\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Fix Mfg)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the new Fix Manufacturing 224 Torque Wrench isn’t really anything revolutionary. It’s just an affordable ratcheting bit-based click-type torque wrench. But for owners of bikes with lightweight components (or really any responsible modern bike owner), you really should have a torque wrench at home to make sure you are properly tightening – but not overtightening – most of the bolts on your bike. And the 224 offers a wider range than most, at a more affordable pricepoint than most, and in a neat &amp; easy-to use package.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Proper Torque Settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1350\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg 224 simple affordable easy-to-use home mechanic torque wrench, suspension\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_tighten-suspension-link-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fix’s 224 offers a wide 2-24Nm of torque settings, meaning it’s about 1/3 wider range than most torque wrenches. Sure, most lightweight cockpit components are in the 4-6Nm range. But occasionally, I find a component or suspension torque spec up around 20 that exceeds most compact wrenches, and end up adjusting by feel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, there are still higher torque settings when you get into pedals, cranks &amp; bottom brackets, so this won’t solve every on-bike tightening need. But it looks like a wider than most workable range, especially for lightweight components. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg 224 simple affordable easy-to-use home mechanic torque wrench, contents with bits\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench-and-bits-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fix 224 Torque Wrench features a simple rotating 2-24Nm torque adjustment, but with easier-to-read-than-most setting. Spin the lower handle to align with even torque settings on one side, then odd numbers on the other. Less guesswork whether lines match up under or over your desired torque setting. Then, just tighten away at your bolts ’til it clicks. (<em>Then, dial it back down to zero, when you’re done.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 224 features a “mostly all metal construction” for long-life durability, with a 72T ratcheting head for easy work in tight spaces. The light 150g wrench is 20cm long with an ergonomic-shaped handle for good leverage &amp; grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_loaded-case-inside.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_loaded-case-inside.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg 224 simple affordable easy-to-use home mechanic torque wrench, in case\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_loaded-case-inside.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_loaded-case-inside-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_loaded-case-inside-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_loaded-case-inside-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_loaded-case-inside-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fix 224 Torque Wrench comes in a full metal case with 10 hardened S2 steel 1/4″ hex &amp; torx tool bits, plus a 60mm bit extension. Fix says the 26cm x 6cm x 4.5cm metal case will be the “crown jewel of your workbench”.  But that also means you are less likely to lose that key bit you need most.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fix 224 Torque Wrench – Pricing &amp; limited edition availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2401\" height=\"1351\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg 224 simple affordable easy-to-use home mechanic torque wrench, limited edition\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate.jpg 2401w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_limited-edition-number-plate-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://fixmfg.com/product/224-torque-wrench-set/\" target=\"_blank\">pre-order now</a> through next weekend (<em>after July 4th</em>), Fix Mfg will knock the regular $120 price tag down to $99.95. Plus, the first 300 of their 224 wrenches get their cases individually numbered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fix Manufacturing is also working on an affordable calibration service, so this will be a lifetime tool. Ultimately after tightening around 5000 times, it’s generally recommended to recalibrate a torque wrench. That’s a lot of wrenching for the home mechanic, but maybe 6-12 months for a working mechanic. In either case, Fix hopes to have the recalibration service available for about $20-30 for the 224. So you’ll always be sure of how tight you’re going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://fixmfg.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FixMfg.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fix-mfg-224-torque-wrench-hits-easy-to-use-sweet-spot-light-affordable-in-pre-order/\">Fix Mfg 224 Torque Wrench Hits Easy-To-Use Sweet Spot, Light &amp; Affordable in Pre-Order</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3abf94470a3d73a46280f43a20776ae804293224b47e5f893ca61726b3897660","category":"Cycling"}
