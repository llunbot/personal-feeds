These machines bring the M4 chip series to Apple's Mac lineup for the first time, but each in its own way offers several new features and changes that go beyond processors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-M4-Pro-vs-M4-Max-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we've compiled a recap of all the highlights.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New iMac</h2>\r<br />\nApple on Monday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">announced</a> its latest 24-inch iMac, bringing the M4 chip to the all-in-one desktop computer. The iMac with M4 delivers up to 1.7x faster performance for daily productivity tasks and 2.1x faster speeds for demanding workflows like photo editing and gaming, according to Apple. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-iMac-M4-hero-feature.jpg\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nThe base model now includes 16GB of RAM, double the amount of the previous entry-level configuration, with an option for up to 32GB. For the M4 iMac models with 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, all four of the USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 4 transfer speeds of up to 40Gb/s. The prior-generation M3 iMac with four ports had two Thunderbolt 3 ports and two USB-3 ports. The 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU models only have two ports, but both of those are Thunderbolt 4. All of the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports also support USB 4 and USB 3.1 Gen 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKey features of the new iMac include:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li>New 12MP front camera with Center Stage and Desk View support.</li>\r<br />\n    <li>New color options including green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and blue.</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Optional nano-texture display for further reduced glare (+$200).</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Four Thunderbolt 4 ports on higher-end models (up from two Thunderbolt 3 ports).</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Support for up to an 8K external display at 60Hz with M4 chip with 10-core CPU/GPU.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>The updated iMac is available to order now.
