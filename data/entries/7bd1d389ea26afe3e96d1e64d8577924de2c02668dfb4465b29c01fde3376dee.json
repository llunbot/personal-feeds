Beyond SteamOS, there is Windows, which can <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/3/\">let down ambitious Deck-likes,</a> there is the Nintendo Switch, and there are Android-based devices that are a lot like Android phones. This setup has got at least one company saying, in infomercial tones, that there has <em>got</em> to be a better way.</p>\n<p>That company is Playtron, a new software startup that aims to fix that setup with a Linux-based gaming OS that's tied to no particular game store or platform. Playtron has $10 million, coders from open source projects like ChimeraOS and Heroic Games Launcher, and the former CEO of Cyanogen. With that, it aims to have \"Playtron-native devices shipping worldwide in 2025,\" and to capture the 1 billion \"core casual\" gamers they see as under-served.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Demo of Playtron running on a Lenovo Legion Go, uploaded by Playtron CEO Kirk McMaster. </p></div>\n<p>What devices will Playtron use to serve them? Some of them might be Steam Decks, as you will \"soon be able to install Playtron on your favorite handheld PC,\" according to <a href=\"https://www.playtron.one/\">Playtron's ambitious, somewhat scattershot single-page website</a>. Some might be \"Playtron-powered 5G devices coming soon to markets around the world.\" Really, though, Playtron aims to provide a gaming platform to any device with a CPU and a screen, be it desktop or mobile, ARM or x86, TV or car.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010961#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010961&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7bd1d389ea26afe3e96d1e64d8577924de2c02668dfb4465b29c01fde3376dee","category":"Tech"}
