{"title":"Apple Products Now Include 7-Day Complimentary AppleCare+ in Australia","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/7-days-complimentary-applecare-australia/","date":1633701362000,"content":"Apple this month started including 7-day complimentary AppleCare+ coverage with new products purchased through its stores in Australia, including any new Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods, HomePod mini, and more. The complimentary coverage is automatically included with the purchase of a qualifying new Apple product.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/applecare-complimentary.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe addition was brought to our attention today by MacRumors reader Jack Jacobs, but based on recent updates to the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/au/legal/sales-support/applecare/applecareplus/\">AppleCare+ terms and conditions in Australia</a>, it appears the change was implemented last week, on September 30.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe complimentary AppleCare+ period provides the same coverage as a paid AppleCare+ plan, including coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage, according to the terms and conditions. After the complimentary coverage expires, customers may purchase AppleCare+ as a one-time purchase or on a monthly basis.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's unclear why Apple implemented this change, but it could relate to strong warranty protections under Australian Consumer Law. The complimentary AppleCare+ coverage is not available in the United States or other countries that we checked.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Ordered the new Apple Watch!

Under the new regulations, there is a mandatory four-day pause between the sale of a product and any add-on insurance for that product, so Apple is providing seven days of free AppleCare+ coverage to span that gap.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe regulations apply across a broad range of product categories and are intended to help protect customers against high-pressure sales and poor-value insurance products frequently offered at the time of product purchase.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/7-days-complimentary-applecare-australia/\">Apple Products Now Include 7-Day Complimentary AppleCare+ in Australia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-products-now-include-7-day-complimentary-applecare-in-australia.2316017/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rCU6PgB83nw:GaBZ6vdwU-Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rCU6PgB83nw:GaBZ6vdwU-Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rCU6PgB83nw\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"52691dd12e6ea02496d6bef34d875726a9562785a895c38a2211185c34b10ec3","category":"Apple"}
