Instead of a single commingled set of system and data files, with Apple trying to ensure the integrity and immutability of system files, the company split it into two parts: a system volume and a Data volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two are melded together into a “volume group,” an organizational method added in Catalina. When you boot macOS Catalina or later, the startup volume appears in the Finder as a single entity; behind the scenes, they’re two: “Volume Name” and “Volume Name – Data”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re trying to erase your startup volume completely—say, to sell it to someone or as a trade-in—you can make use of an easily overlooked option in Disk Utility labeled Erase Volume Group.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mac911-erase-volume-group-selected-1.png\" /><figcaption>Select a volume in the volume group within the container before clicking Erase (top) and the Erase Volume Group options appears as a choice (bottom).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To erase your startup volume group, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Boot your Mac into recoveryOS. On an Intel Mac, restart or start up while holding Command-R; with an M1, shut down the Mac, then hold down the power button until “Loading startup options” appears.</li><li>Navigate to macOS Recovery, which may involve selecting a user account and entering its password to unlock the startup volume.</li><li>Click <em>Disk Utility</em> at the bottom of macOS Recovery’s screen.</li><li>Select either of the two volumes in the container for the system (see figure).</li><li>Click <em>Erase</em>.</li><li>Note that while the main volume is filled in and its name can be changed, and there’s a prominent Cancel/Erase set of buttons, look to the lower-left corner for the <em>Erase Volume Group</em> button. Click that. (This option doesn’t appear if you have selected the container or drive on which the volume group appears.)</li><li>Confirm the operation.</li></ol><p>Now both your system and Data volumes are deleted, providing a fresh start for a new owner or new macOS installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
