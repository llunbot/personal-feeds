That’s why we’re pretty stoked about finding the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX24BN3L\" target=\"_blank\">15-inch M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM for $1,449 at Amazon</a>, a $250 discount and the best price we’ve ever seen.

We loved the laptop’s design and weight, the great performance, and the excellent battery life. “The MacBook Air is a great laptop, especially for users who prioritize mobility. Thanks to Apple silicon, it can handle whatever task you need to do, whether it’s as simple as using a word processor while being online with a gazillion Safari tabs open, or a bit more complex with iMovie and GarageBand, or pro-level work with a video production tool or software development,” our review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this is a MacBook Air, one thing you’ll love about this laptop is its weight because it’s only 3.3 pounds. You’ll barely feel it in the bag. The laptop’s battery life is also worth mentioning because you can enjoy the device for up to 18 hours on a single charge. And since this model has 16GB of RAM, it’ll be able to handle anything you throw at it, including the highest-end Apple Intelligence features in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15.1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and order the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX24BN3L\" target=\"_blank\">M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM at Amazon</a> before the deal expires.</p>\n\n\n<span>This M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM is down to its best price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX24BN3L\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3efbcf65ee61dc138a86323170745a8d5aaf8e59a5c3e9f34cca1b71456a38fe","category":"Apple"}
