T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile ONE plan,\" T-Mobile <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next\">said in a press release</a> in January 2017. T-Mobile ONE was priced at $40 per line for a family of four with AutoPay enabled, and T-Mobile made similar pricing promises for other plans, including the Simple Choice Plan, Magenta, Magenta Max, Magenta 55+, and Magenta Amplified options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nT-Mobile raised prices by $2 to $5 per line for the legacy plans, and while there was a price promise, fine print did give the company an out. T-Mobile released an FAQ that said if prices did increase, T-Mobile customers could cancel and get their final bill paid, a policy applicable for accounts activated between January 2017 and April 28, 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lawsuit claims that T-Mobile's FAQ wording is \"contrary to the language\" provided at the time that T-Mobile customers signed up for their legacy plans, and as such, T-Mobile has \"breached its agreement\" with customers and caused them monetary injury.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nT-Mobile is being accused of making false or misleading statements, deceiving customers, and intentionally concealing plans to raise rates. Plaintiffs are seeking class action status for the suit, an injunction preventing T-Mobile from raising prices, restitution for \"all amounts\" T-Mobile earned from its misconduct, refunds for the additional money paid after price increases, and additional damages for injuries suffered.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/t-mobile-price-guarantee-lawsuit/\">T-Mobile Sued for Breaking Lifetime Price Guarantees</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-sued-for-breaking-lifetime-price-guarantees.2432307/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bbc501759f2730c38f440492dfaf3e8d1bf4f6c1925e718861f92c6644112099","category":"Apple"}
