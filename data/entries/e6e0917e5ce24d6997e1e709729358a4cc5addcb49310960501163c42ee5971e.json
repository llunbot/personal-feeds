Run the new 2.4″ wide aggressive 29er Wyrm front &amp; rear for mixed trail conditions – or pair it with a faster-rolling <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hutchinson-kraken-unleashes-fast-new-trail-ready-2-3-xc-mountain-bike-tire/\" target=\"_blank\">Kraken</a> rear for dry hardpack riding, or the more meaty <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hutchinson-griffus-enduro-mtb-tire-launches-their-new-racing-lab-program/\" target=\"_blank\">Griffus</a> for looser trail riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Wyrm downcountry trail MTB all-mountain bike tire, all-new tread design\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_new-trail-tread-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wyrm is an all-new MTB tread design from Hutchinson, the second in their newest downcountry line-up since the XC Kraken recently got a bigger 2.4″ option. But now the Wyrm takes grip to another level with bigger shoulder lugs and a more burly but still fast-rolling center tread design. They call it a happy medium between the Kraken and the Griffus, but it doesn’t really share any lug shaping with either tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Wyrm downcountry trail MTB all-mountain bike tire, tread rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering-800x320.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering-768x307.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_tread-pattern-rendering-1536x614.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it’s an all-new design. Taller chevrons linked in groups of four lugs form the quick-rolling center tread with enough space in between each group to prevent too much mud build-up. Then two box rows of tall shoulder lugs offer plenty of grip for soft cornering, with inline sipes for a bit more deformation over hard objects in the corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Wyrm downcountry trail MTB all-mountain bike tire, construction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_construction-cutaway-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Construction-wise, the new Hutchinson Wyrm shares the same tubeless-ready 66tpi casing and bead-to-bead Hardskin protection as the same size 2.4″ Kraken, paired with 3-compound XC Race Riposte rubber.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Wyrm downcountry trail MTB all-mountain bike tire, 929g actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_929g-actual-weight-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still a relatively low-height tire compared to more aggressive all-mountain tires, and has a round profile for a smooth transition from straight-line rolling into those grippy corners. Having just arrived for us to test at a real 920g &amp; 929g (together with some 845g 2.4″ Krakens), the new Wyrm seems like a tire best suited to dry trail conditions, but with enough shoulder grip for soft &amp; loamy corners. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Wyrm downcountry trail MTB all-mountain bike tire, dirt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_dirt-grip-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, I tend to opt for a more aggressive tire for trail riding, but with dry summer weather taking over – and drought conditions prevailing in central Europe – I’m actually looking forward to how riding a faster downcountry tire will feel on my technical home trails. And paired with a Kraken out back, to see the mix of speed and grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hutchinson Wyrm – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Wyrm downcountry trail MTB all-mountain bike tire, colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hutchinson-Wyrm-downcountry-mountain-bike-tire_color-options-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top Racing Lab version of the new Hutchinson Wyrm downcountry tire – made-in-France – is available now in both tanwall and all-black editions for 76€, at a claimed weight of 950g.
