But an expected corresponding low-frequency gravitational wave background—a kind of \"hum\" comprised of a chorus of gravitational waves, most likely emanating from binary pairs of supermassive black holes—has proven more elusive. Now the <a href=\"http://nanograv.org/\">North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves </a>(NANOGrav) has announced the first evidence of this gravitational wave background. The results and related analyses are described in several new papers published in the The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>\n<p>The collaboration stopped short of claiming outright detection, opting to describe their results instead as strong evidence of the expected gravitational wave background. That said, \"In our statistical analyses, there's a less than 1-in-1,000 chance of nature giving our results without gravitational waves being present,\" NANOGrav chair Stephen Taylor of Vanderbilt University said during a press briefing.</p>\n<p>As previously reported, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/danish-physicists-claim-to-cast-doubt-on-detection-of-gravitational-waves/\">LIGO detects</a> gravitational waves via <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/ligos-gravitational-wave-detection-takes-home-a-nobel/\">laser interferometry</a>, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington, and in Livingston, Louisiana. (A third detector in Italy, <a href=\"http://www.ego-gw.it/virgodescription/pag_4.html\">Advanced VIRGO</a>, came online in 2016.) On September 14, 2015, at 5:51 am ET, both detectors picked up signals within milliseconds of each other for the very first time—direct evidence for two black holes spiraling inward toward each other and merging in a massive collision event that sent powerful shockwaves across spacetime. That <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/holy-shit-scientists-have-confirmed-the-existence-of-g-1755465297\">first direct</a> detection was <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/weve-found-gravitational-waves-now-what-1755125155\">announced</a> on February 11, 2016, spawned headlines worldwide, snagged the 2017 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/ligos-gravitational-wave-detection-takes-home-a-nobel/\">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>, and officially launched a new era of so-called \"multi-messenger\" astronomy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950301#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950301&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b266a8135f54f3f5752c0d0a3a1034af5d60f1910c68b9e0df9736824c84fe8","category":"Tech"}
