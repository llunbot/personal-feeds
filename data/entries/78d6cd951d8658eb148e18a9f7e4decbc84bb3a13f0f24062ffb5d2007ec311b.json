Today’s deal can fix that for very cheap: <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Finsignia-lightning-to-3-5-mm-headphone-adapter-2-pack-white%2F6413140.p%3FskuId%3D6413140&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2313982-1-0-0\">Best Buy is selling a 2-pack of Insignia Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone adapters for just $6</a>, a savings of $11.50 and the best price you’re ever going to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This adapter has one job: One end connects to the Lightning port on your iPhone and the other accepts a 3.5mm jack from your headphones or some other audio device. The cables are braided, so they should stay free from frays and breaks, and since you get two, you can keep one in a bag, use it on another device, or give it to a lucky friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2313982-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter?afid=p238%7Cs8VCCZEQ2-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_616237453587_pgrid_142885899249_pntwk_g_pchan_online_pexid__&amp;cid=aos-us-kwgo-pla-btb--slid---product-MMX62AM/A\">Apple sells a similar adapter for $9</a>, so this deal is quite a bargain. We’re not sure how long stock will remain, so if you want one go grab one now.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"78d6cd951d8658eb148e18a9f7e4decbc84bb3a13f0f24062ffb5d2007ec311b","category":"Apple"}
