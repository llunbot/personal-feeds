Now anyone on the social media platform can use them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPasskeys are both easier to use and more secure than passwords because they let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: With <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, or a device passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple integrated passkeys into iOS in 2022 with the launch of iOS 16, and it is also available in iPadOS 16.1 and later as well as macOS Ventura and later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo set up passkeys in X on ‌iPhone‌, follow these steps:\r<br />\n<ol><li>Log in to the X app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Click <strong>Your account</strong> in the navigation bar.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Select <strong>Settings and privacy</strong>, then click <strong>Security and account access</strong>, then <strong>Security</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Under <strong>Additional password protection</strong>, click <strong>Passkey</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Enter your password when prompted.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Select <strong>Add a passkey</strong> and follow the prompts.</li></ol> <div><blockquote><p>Update: Passkeys is now available as a login option for everyone globally on iOS!
