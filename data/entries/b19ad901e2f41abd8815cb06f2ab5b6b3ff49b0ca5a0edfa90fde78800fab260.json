Zach was able to snag some <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sea-otter-roundup-new-apparel-eyewear-protection-bags-bikepacking-bike-packing/\" target=\"_blank\">pictures of the early samples</a>, and it seems Q36.5 has moved quickly, bringing them to production.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1935\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoe riders\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--1536x1161.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--120x91.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--768x580.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-riders--2048x1548.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Images: Q36.5)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are <em>next-level</em>, race-ready kicks that just made their WorldTour debut (secretly) under the Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team at Strade Bianche—a proper proving ground if there ever was one. It’s only fitting that these super race slippers would officially launch at the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-close-up--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-close-up--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoe close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-close-up--jpeg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-close-up--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-close-up--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-close-up--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-close-up--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Q36.5 shoes are crafted in the Italian Dolomites and shaped by a quest for beautiful design driven by rider feedback. The Unique Pro claims the lowest stack height on the market (see update below), weighing 225g (size 42) and having a total stack height of 4.4 mm. Yeah, you read that right—4.4mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://bontcycling.com/products/vaypor-2023\">The Bont Vaypor </a>has a lower stack height at an insane 3.6mm and a weight of 200g (size 42) </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-all-last--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-all-last--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoe all last\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-all-last--jpeg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-all-last--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-all-last--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-all-last--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-all-last--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Low, Fast, and Tuned</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With this shoe, Q36.5 went full-gas on fit, feel, and feedback. The carbon sole is just 2mm thick, developed in-house using a proprietary layup process that delivers stiffness without bulk. That low stack height should translate to impressive feedback on the pedals and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-insole-.webp\"><img width=\"1472\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-insole-.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoe insole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-insole-.webp 1472w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-insole--297x218.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-insole--120x88.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-insole--768x563.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A cupped heel design and BOA-powered Power Strap lock your foot into the heel cup, minimizing heel slip or midfoot mush during all-out efforts. The updated wider metatarsal zone adds comfort for longer days in the saddle, especially for those with high arches or broader feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-BOA-detail--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-BOA-detail--1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoe BOA detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-BOA-detail--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-BOA-detail--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-BOA-detail--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-BOA-detail--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-logo-on-buckle-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-logo-on-buckle-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoe logo on buckle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-logo-on-buckle-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-logo-on-buckle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-logo-on-buckle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-logo-on-buckle-768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Tongue, All Flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The no-tongue upper is one of the most interesting design cues from previous Q36.5 shoes. Instead, you get a single-piece upper with a ventilated mesh bridge that acts like an air intake for your foot. It improves breathability, eliminates hot spots, and gives the Unique Pro a distinctive look.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-thin-carbon-sole--jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-thin-carbon-sole--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoe thin carbon sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-thin-carbon-sole--jpeg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-thin-carbon-sole--297x205.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-thin-carbon-sole--1536x1063.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-thin-carbon-sole--120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-thin-carbon-sole--768x531.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Handmade in Italy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every pair of Unique Pro shoes is made within 350km of Q36.5’s HQ in Bolzano. They use artisan carbon molding techniques that they claim are more common in aerospace than cycling, and local production keeps the carbon footprint in check, literally and environmentally. With that, you may expect that the Pro Road Shoe won’t be cheap, and you’d be right – these Italian-made beauties are priced at $600 for the pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-white-.webp\"><img width=\"1184\" height=\"1012\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-white-.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-white\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-white-.webp 1184w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-white--297x254.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-white--120x103.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-white--768x656.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-black-.webp\"><img width=\"1270\" height=\"1194\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-black-.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-black-.webp 1270w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-black--297x279.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-black--120x113.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoe-black--768x722.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Specs – Q36.5 Unique Pro Road Shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 225g (size 42)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stack Height:</strong> 4.4mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sizes:</strong> EU 37–48</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Colors:</strong> Black or White</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>$600 / £550</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoes_RD.webp\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoes_RD.webp\" alt=\"Q36.5 Unique Pro Shoes_R&amp;D\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoes_RD.webp 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoes_RD-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoes_RD-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoes_RD-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Q36.5-Unique-Pro-Shoes_RD-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>But Are They Comfortable? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I get it; there’s lots of talk about tech and stack height, but literally none of that matters if the shoe doesn’t fit. We don’t have an answer; we haven’t ridden them yet. Now, if the performance lives up to the promise—and the pedigree, these shoes are on the pointy end of race tech we’ve seen this season. Between the aggressive stance, precision fit, and raw Italian craftsmanship, Q36.5 aims for the top step. Let’s see if the claim meets the performance when we get our review sample. <em>Stay tuned—these are on our radar for review.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check them out at<a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com\" target=\"_blank\"> q36-5.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/q36-5-unique-pro-road-cycling-shoe/\">Q36.5 Launches Pro Road Shoe with the Lowest Stack Height Available</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b19ad901e2f41abd8815cb06f2ab5b6b3ff49b0ca5a0edfa90fde78800fab260","category":"Cycling"}
