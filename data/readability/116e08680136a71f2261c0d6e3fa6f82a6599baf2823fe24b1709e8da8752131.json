Instead of staying inside, my buddy AJ and I decided to book an Amtrak ticket due west from Ann Arbor to Battle Creek Michigan. The plan was we could enjoy an awesome tailwind for about 90 miles without ever having to endure a headwind.&nbsp;The ride itself was much more challenging than expected with swirling cross winds most of the way, so even when drafting, there wasn’t much reprieve. We had to dodge buckets on 3 different occasions and with a 2-hour train delay, instead of the unseasonable warm morning temperatures, we started about 20 degrees colder than expected as the mercury dropped like a rock around 11am. Overall, it was an amazing adventure for a random day in December.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
