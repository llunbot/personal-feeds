Slated for a launch next year, it will seek to turn around recent years' slow tablet sales.</p>\n<p>The information comes from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-27/ipad-pro-2024-magic-keyboard-redesigned-tablet-m3-september-12-event-details-lltgk6fv#xj4y7vzkg\">Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman</a>—as you probably could have guessed by now. Gurman claims to have knowledge of Apple's plans, stating that the new iPad Pro will have everything from a new chip to a new screen technology, a different design, and a revamped keyboard accessory.</p>\n<p>The new chip is obvious—that has been the standard minimum for any new iPad Pro refresh. The current iPad Pro has the M2 chip, and the new one will predictably have the M3 chip. Expect some notable performance gains—not that the M2 was too slow for most people using the iPad Pro already.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963802#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963802&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e5460fcc9a19f12a0647221bd245abcfc64c6cda98c3f1a6d5cd82adbff5ff58","category":"Tech"}
