You see… the new SRAM MTB Pod shifter ergonomics were not a big hit with a lot of racers, MTB brand product managers, and regular ol’ mountain bikers. Sure, their adjustability was great, but it just didn’t feel the same. And after riders learned to love the Rocker paddle that upgraded the original generation of AXS controllers, it was easy to know there could be a better way…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the Pod Rocker!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SRAM AXS Pod Rocker reshifts how wireless mountain bikes shift</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM AXS Pod Rocker fixes bad ergonomics of wireless mountain bike transmission shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-reshifts-how-wireless-mountain-bikes-shift_up-close-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s something we kept noticing on pro XC bikes? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many were still using the old controller with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-eagle-axs-rocker-mod-gives-you-trigger-like-mountain-bike-shifter-paddle/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocker mod</a>, or even something altogether custom like Blips strapped onto their bar.

But now also to reach back with the tip of their index finger to shift both directions, as well. Now, being able to shift from both sides of the Pod, will give riders better ergonomics to take advantage of the original Pod’s angle adjustability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, you can tweak which way the buttons control shifting, dropping, or Flight Attendant modes via the AXS app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SRAM AXS Pod Rocker – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM AXS Pod Rocker fixes ergonomics of T-Type wireless MTB controller, on an ebike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SRAM-AXS-Pod-Rocker-upgrade-you-transmission-shifting_ebike-eMTB-cockpit-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/SRAM)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new left- or right-specific shift ergonomics are available on new Pods.
