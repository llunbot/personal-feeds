The battery mode will be able to cut the power draw of apps and other system features based on device usage, and it will also include a Lock Screen indicator that shows how long it will take an ‌iPhone‌ charge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 19‌'s new battery management tool was designed with the super slim <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a> in mind. Apple's new ultra thin ‌iPhone‌ doesn't have as much space for a battery inside, and some rumors have suggested that the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌'s battery <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/iphone-17-air-battery-life-rumors/\">will not be up to par</a> with the battery life of other <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> models. Apple plans to improve ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ battery life with the AI optimizations, though the feature set will be available for all iPhones that are able to run ‌iOS 19‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with the AI battery mode, several new features coming in ‌iOS 19‌ will be described as \"powered by\" ‌Apple Intelligence‌, with Apple also planning to use that wording for some Apple Watch features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther features coming in ‌iOS 19‌ include a glass-inspired design that looks similar to visionOS, a redesigned Health app with new functionality, updates to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and more. Gurman says that Apple is also \"pushing\" engineers to make sure that the ‌iOS 19‌ update is \"more functional and less glitchy.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdditional details on all the features coming in ‌iOS 19‌ can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">found in our dedicated iOS 19 roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-ai-battery-management/\">iOS 19 Will Include AI Battery Management Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-will-include-ai-battery-management-feature.2456955/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f680f21c8290ad41252ed1ecc5f1bc1bb23947092db6354bc9a44989976dd937","category":"Apple"}
