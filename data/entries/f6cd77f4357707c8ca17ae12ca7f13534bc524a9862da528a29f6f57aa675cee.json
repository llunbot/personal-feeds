{"title":"Gene Hackman Dies at 95","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/movies/gene-hackman-unforgiven-bonnie-clyde.html","date":1740757848000,"content":"\n<p>Loved this remembrance by Manohla Dargis in The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Clint Eastwood needed a performer who could persuasively go\nboot-toe to boot-toe with him in his brutal 1992 western\n<em>Unforgiven</em>, he needed an actor who was his towering equal\nonscreen. Eastwood needed a performer with strange charisma, one\nwho could at once effortlessly draw the audience to his character\nand repulse it without skipping a beat. This actor didn’t need the\naudience’s love, and would never ask for it. He instead needed to\ngo deep and dark, playing a villain of such depravity that he\ninspired the viewer’s own blood lust. Eastwood needed a legend who\ncould send shivers up spines. He needed Gene Hackman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just an unbelievable career, in such a wide variety of films. His roles in <em>The Conversation</em>, <em>The French Connection</em>, and <em>Unforgiven</em> are atop most people’s lists, and I do love each of those movies. But he was so good in everything. What a great Lex Luthor he was in 1978’s <em>Superman</em>. <em>Mississippi Burning</em>, <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>, <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em>, <em>The Birdcage</em>, <em>Hoosiers</em>. By chance, I just re-watched David Mamet’s <em>Heist</em> a few weeks ago. Like so many of Hackman’s movies, that’s another one that repays multiple viewings across decades.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/gene-hackman-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f6cd77f4357707c8ca17ae12ca7f13534bc524a9862da528a29f6f57aa675cee","category":"Tech"}
