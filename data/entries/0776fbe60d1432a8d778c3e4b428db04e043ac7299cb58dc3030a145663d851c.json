Liftoff is set for 8:14 pm ET (01:14 UTC), when 27 engines will roar to life and power the rocket off its launch pad overlooking the Atlantic coastline.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990132#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990132&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0776fbe60d1432a8d778c3e4b428db04e043ac7299cb58dc3030a145663d851c","category":"Tech"}
