Because cyclocross can be dry and hardpacked, grassy and corner-heavy, sand-blown, snowy, and of course, muddy as hell &nbsp;-sometimes all on the same day- there are hundreds of tire options available.</p><p>And even once you’ve chosen a tread, you need to debate the merits of tubular, tubeless, or clincher tires. Luckily, the Bikerumor crew is more than a little cyclocross-obsessed, and here, we’re sharing our favorite tires that have stood up to years of use and abuse.</p><p>We’ve divided this guide into five sections:</p><ul><li><a href=\"#tubulars\">Tubulars</a></li><li><a href=\"#tubeless\">Tubeless Clinchers</a></li><li><a href=\"#gravel\">Gravel ‘Cross-overs</a></li><li><a href=\"#guide\">Buyer’s Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"#faq\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li></ul><p>Most of us are running tubeless tires, and <em>almost</em> every modern clincher cyclocross tire is now tubeless-ready.

Dugast is the first and last name (literally) in cyclocross tires. It’s impossible to talk about CX tires without acknowledging Dugast, which was founded by—you guessed it—André Dugast in the seventies. For many years, Dugast tires were some of the only options available for serious cyclocross racers. The tradition has continued, and we love the <a href=\"https://a-dugastusa.com/products/typhooon-all-around\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Typhoon’s</a>&nbsp;cotton casing for a supple ride capable of winning on World Cup courses as well as your local track. As a nod to the changing times, unlike many cyclocross tires that are only manufactured in 33mm sizes, Dugast added wider options for riders looking for more comfort on their bikes.

Casual racers likely won’t mount a mud tire as their primary tubular tire, but if you live in an area with a lot of mud, using these as your main racing tires or mounting them on a spare wheelset is a smart move.</p><p>Mud tires like this have stronger, deeper treads with plenty of space between the lugs, and we’ve found that the SSC Super Mud sheds it better than any other, thanks to the lightning-shaped lugs that help the mud fly off.

That course is covered with sand dunes and huge swathes of loose, soft sand that require huge amounts of fitness and handling to make it through… and exactly the right tires.</p><p>File treads, like mud tires, are pretty darn specific, but if you race in an area that has a lot of hardpack or sand, like Southern California, they’ll be the fastest option.&nbsp;We love the Dune for its ability to blaze through straight sandy sections, then hit a corner and get just enough traction from the side lugs to make it through without sliding out. The side lugs are just part of the equation, though. The 320 TPI casing, natural rubber tread, and latex tube inside help the tire fold and mold to the shape of the ground as you hit those turns.</p><p>Here’s what’s crazy: It also works great on hardpacked snow and ice. Why? because it puts more rubber on the ground, and the pyramid-shaped nubs grab better than bigger (but fewer) lugs on regular tires.

The triangle lugs are slightly taller, with a bit more spacing between them, and that’s what sets this tire apart for dry, grassy, and sandy courses. They’re low enough to roll fast, but with a bit extra bite to prevent the tire from spinning out on standing climbs and sprints. Small side lugs aren’t terribly aggressive, but they manage to keep us upright on fast corners and off-camber traverses just fine.</p><p>IRC’s cyclocross tires also seem to hold air well (with sealant, of course). Offroaders know that “airing down” their tires helps them float over soft sand, and the same applies here.

You also want to make sure that if you want tubeless tires, your rims are also tubeless ready. And tubulars require tubular-specific wheelsets.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that modern gravel wheels are almost all tubeless ready, but have fairly wide inside bead-to-bead measurements that could cause your 33mm tire to measure as much as 35mm…which could technically disqualify you (if they check).</p><p><strong>Tubeless versus tubular versus clincher.</strong> We go into more detail below, but generally, most top <em>PRO</em> riders run tubular tires (tires that have a tube sewn inside and are glued to your wheels). Some are making the switch to tubeless (which uses a sealant to seal air inside tire, rather than a tube). And of course, clinchers are always an option (with tubes inside), though they require you to run a much higher tire pressure to avoid flatting.</p><p><strong>Tread is based on the type of racing you do</strong>. If you live in sunny southern California, then your races are likely all on hardpack dirt and a set of file treads is optimal. But if you live in a wet muddy area like Oregon, a mud tire might be the best choice. If you have differing race course conditions but can only afford a single set of wheels and tires, opt for an all-arounder. And if you do have the ability to have two sets of cyclocross wheels, we’re fans of having one that generally works for your racing style, like a mud tire, plus an all-arounder so you’re ready for anything.</p><p><strong>Double-check size and style. </strong>Since tire size and width are both important factors, make sure that you’re getting the right style—tubular, tubeless, or clinchers—since many treads come in multiple styles. This gets especially important if you’re shopping a sale, as less popular (i.e. non-tubeless) tires and sizes tend to get discounted more often.</p><p><strong>Determine your budget.</strong> You may notice that on this list, tires range from $120 per tire down to $50, and can get as low as $30 if you look for ultra-budget versions (like Vittoria’s Terreno in a non-tubeless clincher). However, the cheaper you go, the less supple the tire tends to be. This isn’t a big deal if you’re riding in a straight line on the road, but because cyclocross is full of tight, fast turns, you want a tire to be supple and malleable in order to mold and deform as you lean into a corner, in order to have better traction.</p><p>The pricier tires use different materials to make the sidewall less rigid. And of course, tubulars are pricier because they come with a tube installed inside of them, typically are handmade, and are much less popular than generic clinchers or tubeless tires, so you’re paying a premium.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08143516/ConsumateAthleteOct2021jodydwilson-4010-best-cyclocross-tires.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08143516/ConsumateAthleteOct2021jodydwilson-4010-best-cyclocross-tires.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"933\" height=\"1400\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08143516/ConsumateAthleteOct2021jodydwilson-4010-best-cyclocross-tires.jpg 933w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08143516/ConsumateAthleteOct2021jodydwilson-4010-best-cyclocross-tires-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08143516/ConsumateAthleteOct2021jodydwilson-4010-best-cyclocross-tires-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08143516/ConsumateAthleteOct2021jodydwilson-4010-best-cyclocross-tires-80x120.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08143516/ConsumateAthleteOct2021jodydwilson-4010-best-cyclocross-tires-768x1152.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px\"></a></p><h2><a id=\"faq\"></a>Frequently Asked Questions about Cyclocross Tires</h2><p><strong>What are the different types of cyclocross tires?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>File tread:</strong> File treads have a very low tread in the middle with knobs on the sides, and are typically used for hardpack, sand, and snow conditions.</li><li><strong>Mud:</strong> Beefier treads with plenty of space between the lugs define mud tires—they’re designed to allow the mud to ‘shed’ off of the tire as you make your way through, with taller lugs to dig into the muck and create traction.</li><li><strong>All-around:</strong> Typically, these will look similar to a mud tire at a glance, but the treads will be a bit lower and closer together, in order to get better traction offroad and in grass, but not feel squirmy on harder surfaces.</li><li><strong>Gravel:</strong> Low treads, usually tightly packed in the center to roll smoother, with maybe some side lugs for cornering. These will be more like a cyclocross/road tire hybrid.</li></ul><p><strong>What’s the difference between tubeless and tubular?<br></strong>Simply put, tubular tires are tires that have a tube sewn inside and are glued to your wheels. Tubeless tires—what most mountain bikers use—require a sealant inside to seal the tire on and keep the air in, rather than using a tube. And of course, clinchers—tires that require a tube inside to hold air—are a budget alternative.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>What tire width should I run for cyclocross?</strong><br>It depends…are you racing for real? Or just for fun? And does your race promoter care? We’ve seen one guy race a fat bike on a snowy course and win, but it kinda defeated the point of ‘cross, which is suffering.</p><p>Seriously thought, it depends. If your race promoter isn’t checking it and hasn’t stated rules, then tires from 35mm to 40mm will give you more traction and comfort, but the bigger you go, the heavier they get.</p><p>If you’re racing a UCI-sanctioned event, then you’re limited to 33mm wide when mounted to the tire. Remember, some rims will make your tire effectively wider, so mount them early and measure.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173148/usa-cycling-cyclocross-tire-width-rules.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173148/usa-cycling-cyclocross-tire-width-rules.jpg\" alt=\"tire width rules for usa cycling cyclocross races\" width=\"1094\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173148/usa-cycling-cyclocross-tire-width-rules.jpg 1094w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173148/usa-cycling-cyclocross-tire-width-rules-297x75.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173148/usa-cycling-cyclocross-tire-width-rules-800x203.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173148/usa-cycling-cyclocross-tire-width-rules-120x30.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173148/usa-cycling-cyclocross-tire-width-rules-768x194.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1094px) 100vw, 1094px\"></a></p><p>USA Cycling’s rules are different.

Typically, that is around 18 to 33 PSI, depending on your tires (tubular can run the lowest, followed by tubeless), your body weight (the lighter you are, the lower you can safely go), and the course (a lot of small roots or rocks will require higher PSI than a course that’s all grass).</p><p>The goal? To maximize traction by letting the tire deform to the ground quickly and easily. As weird as it sounds, if you feel like you’re just on the edge of peeling the tire off your rim on the hardest corner you make, that’s probably the perfect PSI.</p><p>For muddy conditions, experiment with <em>slightly</em> higher pressure so your tire bites through the muck to hit harder ground underneath. But for snow and sand, go lower so it floats better without sinking down into the ground so much.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173552/extra-tires-for-cyclocross-races-in-the-pits.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173552/extra-tires-for-cyclocross-races-in-the-pits.jpg\" alt=\"person carrying extra wheels and tires to the pits at a cyclocross race\" width=\"1200\" height=\"802\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173552/extra-tires-for-cyclocross-races-in-the-pits.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173552/extra-tires-for-cyclocross-races-in-the-pits-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173552/extra-tires-for-cyclocross-races-in-the-pits-800x535.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173552/extra-tires-for-cyclocross-races-in-the-pits-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14173552/extra-tires-for-cyclocross-races-in-the-pits-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>Can I run mismatched tires?</strong><br>As with mountain biking, you can run mismatched tires, and some pros certainly will in very specific course conditions. We don’t recommend mixing and matching something like a file tread with minimal knobs with a mud tire, but a mud tire in the front and an all-arounder in the rear is certainly a reasonable combination. Ultimately, it’s experience that will help you narrow down specific tire selections per course and weather, so just start with a good all ’rounder and go from there.</p><p><strong>Do I need tubulars?</strong><br>Absolutely not. At the highest level, tubular tires will help you ride smoother and speedier, but you can definitely start racing with clinchers. Heck, cyclocross is such a welcoming sport that you can race it on a mountain bike to get started! Some of us would even argue that with the modern crop of tubeless-ready tires being so good, the marginal gains to be had from tubulars aren’t worth the extra hassle for most riders.</p><p><strong>Can I put tubular tires on any cyclocross wheels?</strong><br>Sadly, no. You need tires that are specifically designed for tubular tires, so often, the wheels that come stock with a cyclocross bike won’t work with tubular tires.</p><p><strong>How do I install tubular tires?</strong><br>If you haven’t installed a tubular tire before and you want to try it on your own rather than taking it to a local bike shop, you’re going to want to watch some how-to videos before taking the plunge, since these pricey tires require a lot of TLC to get them in place. We like this how-to video from ENVE wheels to get you started:</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ux5AvE8uJYU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p><strong>WTF are “open” tubulars?</strong><br>Basically, an open tubular is a kind of fancy way of saying “clincher, but with a nicer, more supple sidewall.” Meaning, it’s got a higher end construction that’s similar to how tubulars are made, except they’re for normal clincher rims. Consider Challenge’s Grifo: The handmade clincher option has a super-poly casing and 300 TPI, while the less expensive vulcanized rubber option only has 120 TPI. It may sound like hype, and they’re expensive, but they actually can make a huge difference in a cyclocross race!</p><p><strong>What’s the deal with cotton sidewalls?</strong><br>Cotton sidewalls are, in a word, supple. While they’re a bit pricier than all-rubber options, they will make your tires feel smoother as you navigate the course.</p><div id=\"attachment_147421\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Challenge-Dune_Team-Edition-cotton-tubulars_damp-sand-side.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-147421\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Challenge-Dune_Team-Edition-cotton-tubulars_damp-sand-side.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Challenge-Dune_Team-Edition-cotton-tubulars_damp-sand-side.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Challenge-Dune_Team-Edition-cotton-tubulars_damp-sand-side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Challenge-Dune_Team-Edition-cotton-tubulars_damp-sand-side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Challenge-Dune_Team-Edition-cotton-tubulars_damp-sand-side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Challenge-Dune_Team-Edition-cotton-tubulars_damp-sand-side-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-147421\">Cotton casing on the Challenge Dune Team Edition</p></div><p><strong>Seriously, why do I want “supple” anything on cyclocross tires?</strong><br>Supple tire casings and sidewalls allow your tires to conform to the ground as you pedal, particularly in corners. If a tire can slightly fold on itself in a corner, you’ll have better traction between the ground and the side treads on your tires. For that reason, we’re excited about the recently released tubeless-ready FMB Slalom/Super Mud Open Tubulars: The potential for such a high-quality supple handmade CX tubeless option sounds great since most tubeless CX tires still rely on stiff vulcanized construction that can’t match the grip at ultra-low pressures of a premium tubular.</p><p><strong>How do I set up tubeless tires?</strong><br>Again, if you’re doing this yourself for the first time, congrats! We’re obviously fans of learning how to do more with your gear. However, don’t try to figure it out without watching a video or two, like this one from Stan’s NoTubes in order to learn a few tips. And make sure that your wheels are actually going to work with tubeless tires—ask your local bike shop for help if you’re struggling!</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUtKp22cf_k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p><strong>Should I go tubular or tubeless for cyclocross?</strong><br>It depends on what you currently have, and what your level of ‘cross commitment is. <em>Some</em> of us still prefer tubular for serious racing, thanks to their supple construction and rideability at lower PSIs for better traction in corners. But most of us have come to appreciate newer tubeless options since it’s easier to swap them out in different conditions or at the end of the season to make your bike more gravel-friendly. We also like tubeless tires for a set of spare wheels that can be swapped out the night before a race to suit conditions, and for trail riding to work on skills.</p><p><strong>What tubeless sealant should I use if it’s freezing?</strong><br>When temperatures start to drop, you’ll want to use cold-weather sealants rather than your standard Stan’s NoTubes.

Given the sometimes harsh conditions, you’re allowed to have a spare bike or extra sets of wheels in a neutral zone in case something breaks or you flat. The pros have entire teams pitted there to keep them running on virtually clean bikes for every lap, and sometimes every half lap! It’s absolutely amazing to witness, check the video above.</p><p>For most of us, having to pit or change a wheel mid-race likely means our “race” is over, but it’s a way to finish out the day without DNF’ing. And you never know what might happen to the folks in front of you, so just finish it out no matter what. Regardless which tires you choose, remember cyclocross is about all-out suffering for 30-60 minutes and then wanting to do it again 10 minutes after you finish. Just go have (type 2) fun!</p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"10d4430c5885afe29cb996f157caea2d2130c3900579507bb2201a7702831f4b","category":"Cycling"}
