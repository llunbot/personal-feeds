{"title":"First Ride Review: New RockShox Reverb AXS Wireless Dropper Post – Travis Engel","link":"https://theradavist.com/review-new-rockshox-reverb-axs/","date":1743674444000,"content":"<p><em>Instead of just introducing a longer Reverb AXS wireless dropper post, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/rockshox/\" target=\"_blank\">RockShox</a> decided to start over. The new air-over-air design is more robust, more serviceable, and less expensive. Plus, it hides a neat trick up its sleeve. Travis spent a few weeks on it, and learned a few things he didn’t expect.</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Last week’s launch of <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-eagle-90-mechanical-transmission-review/\" target=\"_blank\">cable-actuated Transmission</a> proved that SRAM isn’t giving up on mechanical drivetrains. But they have given up on mechanical* dropper posts. RockShox hasn’t produced their hydraulically actuated* Reverb post since about 2023 (though parts and warranties remain). And honestly, I respect their chutzpah. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/oneup-v3-dropper-post-review/\" target=\"_blank\">OneUp</a>, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wolf-tooth-remote-drop-bar-gravel-bike-dropper-lever-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth</a>, and Bike Yoke already make stellar high-end cable-actuated dropper posts. PNW, TranzX and the herd of OEM offerings make fine affordable options. If RockShox wants the Reverb to be bougie, more power to ‘em. I just wish the wireless Reverb posts were a little cheaper and a little longer. Today, I got my wish, and not in a sneaky monkey’s-paw sort of way.</p>\n<h3>RockShox Reverb AXS Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Available in 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, and 250mm lengths</li>\n<li>Available in 30.9, 31.6, and with larger-diameter upper tube and internals in 34.9</li>\n<li>Travel is <em>not</em> internally micro-adjustable</li>\n<li>Air-over-air system</li>\n<li>ActiveRide provides some suspension when saddle is below top-out</li>\n<li>Compatible with any AXS controller, including drop-bar</li>\n<li>Highly user-serviceable</li>\n<li>600 psi shock pump required for to adjust pressure on 30.9 and 31.6 posts</li>\n<li>743 g as tested (30.9 mm diameter, 225 mm travel, with battery, no remote)</li>\n<li>$550 (including battery and charger)</li>\n<li>Remote sold separately for $80</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The previous Reverb AXS lengths ranged from 100 mm to 170 mm. The new one goes from 100 mm all the way up to 250 mm. And although the original Reverb AXS first launched at $860 (including battery, charger, and remote), MSRP was later dropped to $645 (including battery and charger, <i>not</i> including remote). The all-new Reverb AXS goes for $550. Not cheap, but <i>any</i> price drop in 2025 is impressive. The remote costs $80, and you may want to pick up a 600 psi shock pump for $30 to $50. Still, that’s at least $45 less for quite a bit more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The system inside the new Reverb AXS is fundamentally different from the old one. Its guts resemble the “air-over-air” concept found in the gravel-focused <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-rockshox-rudy-xplr-gravel-fork-and-sram-axs-xplr-on-johns-sklar-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Reverb AXS XPLR</a> post. Most traditional droppers are supported by a two-chamber fluid-filled cartridge, and their return force is provided by a separate but concentric air spring. The remote opens a valve in the oil cartridge, allowing fluid to flow from one chamber into another as the post moves. Closing that valve stops the flow, locking the post in place.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-09.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-09.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-09.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-09.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-31.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-31.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-32.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-32.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The air-over-air system is more user-serviceable, and potentially more durable. It works a bit like it sounds. Instead of those two chambers being filled with fluid, they’re filled with very high-pressure air. 600 PSI max on a 30.9 and 31.8 post, or 335 PSI max on the 34.9 post. This accomplishes a few things. For one, it’s very user-serviceable. Most droppers run on a cartridge that you simply replace if it fails. Others have an involved teardown process similar to a damper-cartridge rebuild. The new Reverb AXS “complete service” is still involved, but there’s no bottles of oil, no special tools, and you can go two years between them. A “basic service” is recommended about once a year, and is similar to the seal and bushing refresh you’d do on a traditional post.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-12.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-12.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Another benefit to air-over-air is that there’s no danger of air contamination. In a traditional post, bubbles can form in the fluid-filled chambers and cause a spongy feel when the post is extended. It can either happen slowly over time, or sometimes all at once if you hang or lift the bike by the saddle while the post is compressed. Some droppers have an external valve that allows you to bleed the air from the chamber, or sometimes you can apply a band-aid by compressing the post while the bike is upside-down. But this will never be necessary with an air-over-air system because there’s no oil chamber. As long as the system is holding air, it will be solid. But that brings us to <i>another</i> benefit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“ActiveRide” is a feature that allows for a bit of squish when the saddle rests at any point below full top-out. It’s kind of a natural side-effect of the air-over-air design. Once you lower the post, the air transferred into the second chamber acts as a negative air spring. If you know your suspension terms, a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/shock-value-glossary/#:~:text=pumping%20or%20turning.-,Negative%20air%20spring,-A%20small%20pressurized\">negative air spring</a> is a component in shocks and forks that decreases the breakaway force to create a softer initial feel. When the Reverb AXS is fully extended, there is almost no negative air-spring pressure. But drop it a little, and you get some give.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-25.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-25.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-27.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-27.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Design Features</h3>\n<p>Much more obvious than the air-over-air system is the new battery and control-unit placement. The look is a little polarizing, but I like its more familiar saddle-angle adjustment. Side note: The bolts and nuts are long enough that, when they were loosened to the tips, I could easily remove and install a saddle without disassembling the clamp. Seems that’s always harder than it should be. And shorter riders don’t have to worry about their rear tire flicking their battery off when their suspension bottoms out, which sometimes happened on the original Reverb AXS. A rearward battery orientation isn’t even possible on the new version. The entire saddle-clamp assembly is removable, but it’s keyed so it can only face one way. The control unit is also removable, but it also can’t be rotated.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-04.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-04.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-04.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-04.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-05.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-05.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-03.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-03.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-03.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-03.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The original Reverb AXS put all the business at the top. But now, the only thing up there is the air valve. There’s not much happening at the other end, either. The control unit sends messages via wire down across the bottom of the post, then up to the piston valve inside. There’s actually nothing “mechanical” within that control unit itself. But it sure does take up a lot of space. That’s where shorter riders do lose out a bit. I measured about 60mm of external hardware including the collar and the clamp. It’s better than the original Reverb, which I clocked at 64mm. But the OneUp V3 has only 30 mm of wasted external space.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-28.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-28.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, every year, bike brands are getting better at making seat tubes shorter and insertion depths deeper. But anyone sized below an XXL who truly wants to maximize their drop length would do well to count their millimeters carefully before picking a length. And there’s no internal adjustment to limit the Reverb AXS’s maximum travel. You’ll get what it says on the tin. Mine happened to say 225 mm, which was just right.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Ride Impressions</h3>\n<p>I’ll start at ActiveRide because it’s actually the most subtle feature on the new Reverb AXS. Had I tested it on a hardtail, I may have noticed it more. But on a full-suspension bike, most of that springiness dissolves into the rear shock. Depending on how deep the post is compressed (there’s slightly more “sag” the lower it goes), I got between 10 mm and 15 mm when running 550 psi. In the three weeks I’ve had this post, I only noticed ActiveRide a handful of times. But I always noticed it in the same scenario.</p>\n<p>On extremely technical climbs, I like to drop my saddle a couple inches. I want it out of the way when I stand up, but nearby when it’s more appropriate to sit down. Every bump big enough to have noticeably compressed the post while I was seated was probably big enough to have disrupted my momentum. ActiveRide did limit how much my body got bounced on those climbs, so it definitely helped. But more importantly, it didn’t hurt. That little bit of squish was never unsettling or distracting. And there was <i>maybe</i> 1 mm of it at full extension. The Reverb AXS felt like a normal dropper post. Just electronic.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-33.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-33.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-30.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-30.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>An interesting facet of the multifaceted wireless-versus-mechanical debate is whether the drivetrain or the dropper benefits more from cutting the chord. I say, as always: It depends. On my touring bike, my dropper post is important, but my shifting is <i>more</i> important. That bike does happen to have an AXS dropper, but it was an upgrade that came long after I installed my AXS drivetrain. It doesn’t shred the tek-gnar. It mainly just covers ground. Often quite casually. I like shifting to be <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-dust-up-electronic-bicycle-shifting-is-better/\" target=\"_blank\">as mindless as possible</a>. But on my mountain bike, the most fun moments are long downhills, which don’t involve much shifting. They involve moving my body, moving the bike, and moving the dropper post when I need to sneak in a couple extra cranks. Maybe it’s my injured knees or my advancing age, but I like to sit down whenever I pedal. And on my long, sporadically mellow descents, I pedal a lot. An electronic dropper could make that experience more pleasant, at least in theory.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For those of you who haven’t ever used a wireless dropper, I’d liken it to using a brake lever with an extremely short dead stroke. Everyone has different preferences for brake-lever <em>reach</em>, but I don’t know anyone who likes a lot of <em>dead stroke</em>. That either forces your finger to rest too far from the bar, or puts the peak power point too close to it. And it just delays the action. Dropper levers have a little dead stroke too, and going wireless effectively shortens it to zero.</p>\n<p>It’s the definition of a luxury, but one that can have tangible benefits on the trail. When I use a cable-actuated dropper, I pull my thumb back, push the lever along its slight inward arch, then return my thumb to below the bar. The muscle memory is just as hard-wired into my brain as reaching for my phone and scrolling Instagram. But it’s still a three-part motion. On a wireless post, it’s more of a <i>two-part</i> motion. I pull my thumb back and return it to the bar, but on the way, it gently “flicks” the remote while I compress the saddle or wait for it to rise. It makes dropper activation less of a decision and more of a reflex.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-23.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-23.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-29.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-29.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That introduces a strange, nagging wrinkle when evaluating how quick the Reverb AXS actually is. Dropping the post is no problem. I can only squat so fast anyway. When getting the post down, I give it a 9/10 with regards to speed and eaze. It’d be a 10 if it didn’t take noticeably more force than my OneUp to drop the saddle at full pressure, though my 190-pound ass could barely tell. And lighter-ass riders can lower the pressure if they want less resistance. But evaluating <i>return</i> speed is complicated. The more comfortable I got with that quick thumb action, the more I started assuming that the saddle would raise just as quickly. Instead, I’d sometimes flick the lever and sit down to sneak in some pedals, but I’d find the saddle a few centimeters below where my body expected it to be.</p>\n<p>“A few centimeters” should give you an idea of how minor this issue actually is. The <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tranzx-edp01-wireless-mtb-dropper-post-review/\" target=\"_blank\">TranzX EDP01</a> dropper I reviwed last year would often come up <em>several</em> centimeters short. The Reverb AXS is significantly faster. But still, something weird is happening here. After a couple rides, I worked on getting a bit less careless with my thumb flicks when raising my saddle. I started doing a more positive <i>press</i>, and it got me those centimeters back. It still requires a fraction of the effort of a cable-actuated dropper, but it also requires more thought. I know, I’m not out there deciding how to vote on a local ballot measure. I’m literally just pushing a button. But I wonder if that’s part of the problem.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I did a little home experiment where I pressed and <i>immediately</i> released my OneUp remote, then did the same with my Reverb AXS remote. I wanted to replicate the short, frantic moment of raising my post on a downhill to throw in a couple cranks. And with surprising consistency, my OneUp dropper would extend about 180 mm, while the Reverb AXS would extend about 150 mm. In my brain, each thumbstroke took the same amount of time. And the posts seemed to move at the same speed. So, maybe there’s something else going on here. I wondered if I was getting that extra 30 mm simply because swinging a physical lever will naturally leave the valve open longer than tapping an electronic button. The lever takes more time to actuate, but my mind and thumb are occupied. So, maybe I don’t notice it.  It’s like <a href=\"https://medium.com/caus/the-issue-at-houston-airport-occupied-time-design-542b092b3747\" target=\"_blank\">the story of that Houston airport.</a> Travelers were complaining about long waits to pick up their luggage. So, the airport directed arriving planes to the gates farthest from baggage claim. The walk took an extra six minutes, and the complaints stopped. I couldn’t find solid proof that this isn’t just an urban legend, but it makes sense. Maybe the Reverb AXS isn’t too slow. Maybe it’s too fast.</p>\n<p>So, if I can’t fact-check my anecdotes, I’ll fact-check my speed assessment. I filmed each post extending in slow motion to break down exactly how long they actually took, ignoring what may be happening at the handlebar. At 240 frames per second, my 220 mm OneUp post took 47 frames, and the 125 mm Reverb AXS took 49 frames. Considering the Reverb AXS had an extra 5 mm to travel, they move almost the exact same speed. If any scientists out there want to chime in on my method, feel free. That’s as accurate as I’m going to get. The telemetry equipment I ordered from Switzerland for the data-acquisition wing here at my personal testing campus got held up in customs. But I don’t think it matters. Just know that, if you’re as picky about dropper-post speed as I am, you may need to slightly rewire your brain-thumb connection to get the most of this post.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-18.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-Review-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Is It Worth It?</h3>\n<p>I wrapped up my Eagle 90 cable-actuated Transmission review by soapboxing about the trade-offs we all make when choosing bike components. That applies here too, and not just in my complicated return-speed findings. The Reverb AXS of course puts two batteries on your bike. One of which you’ll have to charge regularly, though the mechanism in the new post is rumored to be less power-hungry than the old one. And then there’s the price. The OneUp V3 I keep using as a benchmark costs <i>half as much</i> as the new Reverb AXS. Now, I’m always ready to make a case for paying double if I think a product offers a universal benefit. Like <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-gx-transmission-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">my $1,100 wireless GX Transmission drivetrain,</a> for example.</p>\n<p>The benefits of the Reverb AXS are more subtle, but some of them can’t be found anywhere else. Air-over-air is potentially the most robust, serviceable, low-maintenance system currently on the market. And if you’ve got an AXS drivetrain, that’s an extra spare battery always on your bike. Then there are the general perks of a wireless dropper. There’s no cable to replace, or to shimmy upward when raising the post to clamp in a repair stand. One less cable is potentially rattling inside your frame, and though <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/headset-cable-routing/\" target=\"_blank\">I don’t like the term “clean cockpit,”</a> there’s one less cable outside it, too. None of these are things that you “need.” But that’s kinda what I like about the new Reverb AXS dropper. Surrounding all of its robust, thoughtful design is a package of pure indulgence.</p>\n<h3>Reverb AXS Dropper Post Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wide range of lengths, including the longest on the market</li>\n<li>Highly user-serviceable</li>\n<li>Zero potential for air-bubble contamination</li>\n<li>Less expensive than its predecessor</li>\n<li>Nearly instant action</li>\n<li>34.9 version is optimized around its larger diameter</li>\n<li>All the advantages of wirelessness</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reverb AXS Dropper Post Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Returning to full extension on long posts requires a deliberate button-press, not just a flick</li>\n<li>Full service on 30.9 and 31.6 posts requires 600 psi pump</li>\n<li>Still kinda expensive</li>\n<li>All the disadvantages of wirelessness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/rockshox\" target=\"_blank\">RockShox</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/review-new-rockshox-reverb-axs/\">First Ride Review: New RockShox Reverb AXS Wireless Dropper Post</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"46231fe55d427ed41c1347dcc417df0533045d4d856ee1fad98c05b9ba85a468","category":"Cycling"}
