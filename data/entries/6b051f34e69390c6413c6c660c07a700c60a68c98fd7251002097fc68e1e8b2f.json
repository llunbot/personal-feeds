A journalist named Dell Cameron then tweeted to encourage the hacker to contact him, then published an interview with Doomed for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/matt-walsh-twitter-hack-doomed/\">Wired</a>. Tweeting out that story—Cameron <a href=\"https://journa.host/@dell/110227515303617932\">confirmed on Mastodon</a>—ultimately got the tech policy reporter permanently suspended from Twitter for violating the social platform’s <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hacked-materials\">policy</a> on distributing hacked materials.</p>\n<p>Now, Walsh is threatening to sue “members of the media who openly solicited stolen information” from his phone, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1648821950561542144\">tweeted</a>. Announcing that The Daily Wire’s team was assisting him with legal counsel, he warned journalists like Cameron that he could afford to hire “very good lawyers.”</p>\n<p>Walsh could not immediately be reached for comment. Cameron declined to comment. Yesterday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1648827525961773062\">Wired tweeted</a> a statement from its managing editor, Hemal Jhaveri.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933486#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933486&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b051f34e69390c6413c6c660c07a700c60a68c98fd7251002097fc68e1e8b2f","category":"Tech"}
