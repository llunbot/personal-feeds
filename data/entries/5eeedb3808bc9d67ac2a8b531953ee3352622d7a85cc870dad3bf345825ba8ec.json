The January 1975 issue of\nPopular Electronics featured an Altair 8800 on the\ncover. The Altair 8800, created by a small electronics\ncompany called MITS, was a groundbreaking personal\ncomputer kit that promised to bring computing power to\nhobbyists. When Paul and I saw that cover, we knew two\nthings: the PC revolution was imminent, and we wanted\nto get in on the ground floor.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, personal computers were practically non-\nexistent. Paul and I knew that creating software that\nlet people program the Altair could revolutionize the\nway people interacted with these machines. So, we\nreached out to Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS, and\ntold him we had a version of the programming language\nBASIC for the chip that the Altair 8800 ran on.</p>\n\n<p>There was just one problem: We didn’t.<br />\nIt was time to get to work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the bottom Gates links to a printout of the original source code for the BASIC interpreter, in extensively commented assembly language.
