From kickstarting its spatial computing era with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2231451/apple-vision-pro-review.html\">Vision Pro</a> to finally embracing AI on its platforms—the firm has laid some solid groundwork that could reshape the tech industry in the coming years. Nevertheless, the iPhone maker still has some tricks up its sleeve. If the rumors turn out to be accurate, Apple will launch several exciting products next year, and we’ve got our eyes set on a few of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HomePad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most thrilling 2025 announcement for smart home enthusiasts will be Apple’s long-rumored HomePod with a display—better known as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePad</a>. The HomePad is rumored to launch late next year as a smart home hub that rivals Nest and similar products. The tablet-like device will likely feature a 6- to 7-inch screen and pack the iPhone 16’s A18, a chip more powerful than anything HomePod runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the HomePad is expected to offer a specialized interface that revolves around smart home controls, its purpose could extend beyond that. After all, the hub will reportedly support Apple Intelligence and next-gen Siri, FaceTime calls, and other features not necessarily related to smart home functions, including Music, Safari, and Notes. More importantly, it could mark the beginning of a new smart home chapter at Apple, as the company is also rumored to be working on a security camera for 2026.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 Plus USB C Charging Port\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iPhone-16-Plus-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone 17 could introduce a model that’s dramatically thinner than the iPhone 16.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Connor Jewiss / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17 Air</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting device that could launch late next year is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 Air</a>. Apple is reportedly developing an ultra-slim smartphone that could dethrone the 6.9mm iPhone 6 as its thinnest ever, along with a new design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opting for a 5mm to 6mm thickness will likely push Apple to make several compromises. For example, the iPhone 17 Air is rumored to have a single rear camera centered on the top rear of the phone. It may also miss out on the Pro variant of the A19 chip and retire the physical SIM card slot globally. In short, the iPhone Plus replacement will likely appeal to those seeking the sleekest aesthetics rather than the best possible performance and specs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even if the iPhone 17 Air isn’t the most technologically advanced compared to the rest of the line, it could act as the foundation for Apple’s future products, particularly foldables. The new design appears to be a way to test the real-world performance and durability of an ultra-thin handset as Apple continues to work on its rumored foldable iPhone, which isn’t due until 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone SE 4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a midrange phone, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a> will be getting a lot of love—and attention—in 2025. Rumored to launch in its usual spring slot, the budget-friendly model looks to finally retire the prehistoric chassis in favor of a more modern one. On the front side, it will reportedly resemble an iPhone 14, boasting a notched edge-to-edge display that drops the physical home button at long last. Other notable improvements could include Face ID support, a sharper rear camera, a USB-C port, and an A18 processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, those opting for SE iPhones had to sacrifice the design and some nice-to-have perks. With the iPhone SE 4 supporting Apple Intelligence and finally adopting a modern enclosure, it won’t feel like a device from the 2010s anymore. And if Apple can keep the price under $499, it’ll be a real winner.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Studio Display\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>A new Studio Display could make an appearance in 2025.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Willis Lai / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Studio Display 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released its first and only <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Studio Display</a> back in 2022. The 27-inch LCD monitor starts at $1,599 and features a humble refresh rate of 60Hz, a stunning 5K pixel resolution, up to 600 nits of brightness, a 12MP ultra-wide webcam, multiple USB-C ports, six speakers, and three microphones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the current Studio Display looks great and works well with Apple’s Mac lineup, its specifications could use a bump. For starters, Apple could give it a mini-LED display similar to the MacBook Pro, with a higher refresh rate, 1,600 nits of max XDR brightness, and a Nano-texture option. The design could also use an update, perhaps with “Liquid Retina” rounded corners and a thinner enclosure like the iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not as certain as the other products on this list, but the latest rumors suggest Apple will launch an update to the 27-inch monitor in the spring alongside the M4 Mac Studio and Mac Pro. It’ll look equally slick next to the new micro Mac mini and the next item on our list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 Ultra Mac Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Mac Pro</a> is no longer powered by an Intel chip, but it’s the only Apple computer that still has its Intel-era design. While all other Macs have been seriously slimmed down since the transition to Apple’s M-series processors, the Mac Pro’s body—despite not needing memory slots for RAM sticks anymore—continues to be relatively bulky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, Apple will reportedly launch an M4 Ultra-powered Mac Pro, boasting up to 32 CPU cores, 80 GPU cores, and 512GB of RAM when maxed out. While the rumors seemingly don’t reference a fresh exterior look, it’ll be around six years since its last facelift. On the other hand, the Mac Pro is generally a niche computer, so Apple could easily get away with just boosting its performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not just an iterative year</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HomePad and iPhone 17 Air will potentially ignite Apple’s push into two new categories: the smart home and foldables. Meanwhile, the iPhone SE 4 will be the first of its kind to offer both impressive specs and a modern exterior for a reasonable price tag. And while the Studio Display and Mac Pro may not be as popular as other Apple products, their potential 2025 successors will feature welcome enhancements that their fans will appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech reviewers and enthusiasts often complain that today’s devices, particularly those coming out of Cupertino, have become too iterative. Vision Pro aside, that was largely the case with 2024’s slate of releases. But 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for Apple.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d1791dbe60b21f5692558b03c537490c748c417a42e2c168c2c564788ece0e00","category":"Apple"}
