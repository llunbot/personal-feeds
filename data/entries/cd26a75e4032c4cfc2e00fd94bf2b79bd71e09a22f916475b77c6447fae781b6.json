Now there’s finally a bigger, wider Ass Savers Win Wing MTB, made just for mountain bikes. And now it will clear up to a 29 x 3″ tire.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Ass Savers started development of the wider MTB version to target adventure riders and bikepackers that wanted to keep themselves and their gear from getting sprayed and covered in mud. Remember, a lot of bikepacking saddle packs are waterproof. But it’s still a pain to get in and out with all your gear, from a muddy bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail.webp\" alt=\"Ass Savers Win Wing MTB fender Review: lightweight, affordable strap-on rear mountain bike tire mud guard protection, on Jeronimo hardtail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_on-Jeronimo-steel-enduro-hardtail-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So ultimately, they saw how many regular mountain bikers also would appreciate a simple, lightweight, durable, and low-cost rear wheel fender. To keep the rider dry and preserve dropper post function. Who services their dropper post like they’re supposed to, anyway! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the wider Ass Savers Win Wing MTB project became strap-on rear fender for all mountain bikers. And that meant it needed more adjustability</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size.webp\" alt=\"Ass Savers Win Wing MTB fender Review: rear mountain bike tire mud guard vs. gravel size \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_mountain-bike-mud-guard-vs-gravel-version-blade-size-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the gravel version, which can already officially clear up to a 700x60mm (29 x 2.3″) tire, the new Win Wing MTB has clearance for up to a 29 x 3″ mountain bike tire.

And you can now adjust the blade angle itself +/-15° for a nice &amp; functional flat installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view.webp\" alt=\"Ass Savers Win Wing MTB fender Review: lightweight, affordable strap-on rear mountain bike tire mud guard protection, side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ass-Savers-Win-Wing-MTB-fender-Review_light-affordable-strap-on-rear-mountain-bike-tire-mud-guard-protection_side-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ass Savers designed the new Win Wing MTB’s Tangential Coverage to sit just above your tire to catch most rear wheel spray where it originates at the tire. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>works best when the wishbone is located at the top of the tire, with just 1cm of clearance between the tire and the fender bracket.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>adjust the legs of the wishbone to align its top directly above the rear axle, then…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>make sure to fold the flat fender blade along all the pre-scored marks to get the proper curved shape, and lastly…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>adjust the fender blade angle to be horizontal or tipped slightly upwards for max ass saving performance</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And don’t worry about getting it stuck in the rear wheel when you pick up trail debris or a bunch of sticky mud. The anti-jam wishbone layout flexes forward, away from the tire if something sticks in your rear wheel.
