an aerodynamic overhaul to its Agree road bike and expanding its off-road offering</p>\n<div>\n      <p> Cube has announced a raft of changes in its 2022 bike range with updates to both its road and off-road selection.</p>\n<p>The German brand revealed that from this year all of its road bikes will have disc brakes, familiar territory considering its origins in mountain bike making.</p>\n<p>There are upgrades across its drop bar collection, overhauling its Agree road bike design and adding gravel and cyclocross options.</p>\n<h3>Aero refined</h3>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a

comes in the Agree C:62 as Cube has given it 'a completely new frame' that has been aerodynamically optimised, apparently saving 10 watts – though the brand doesn't specify at what speed those savings are made.</p>\n<p>There is also the possibility of saving an (yes, one) extra watt by mounting a 'special storage pouch' on the underside of the top tube with the top tier models, the SL and SLT, also coming with fully integrated cables further boosting both aerodynamics and aesthetics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/reviews/9679/cube-agree-c62-slt-review\" target=\"_blank\">Check out Cyclist's review of the

Cube is also introducing two new models to its off-road selection.</p>\n<p>Firstly, there's the Nuroad C:62 SLT, a carbon gravel bike that comes in at the very top of the series, above the C:62 SL, Race and Pro bikes.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9966/cube-bikes-2022-images#8\"><p><span>Image 9 of</span> 15</p><img
