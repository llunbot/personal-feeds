The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Apple Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these ‘events,’ and streams them live online to millions of watchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far in 2025 Apple hasn’t held any events, however, it did launch a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone 16e</a> via press release on February 19, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">new iPad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2595313/ipad-air-2025-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a> via press release on March 4, and a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">Mac Studio</a> on March 5. However, there is an Apple Event coming up very soon, so mark your calendars now! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next Apple Event will take place on June 9 when Apple kicks off it’s Worldwide Developers Conference (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC</a>) with a keynote and shows off new features coming to iOS and macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out about the events and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">Apple’s new product launches</a> coming in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s next event? </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WWDC: Monday June 9, 2025</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has confirmed that the WWDC keynote will take place on Monday, June 9, starting at 10 am PT. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the next Apple event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple keynotes usually start at 10 am PT and this will be the case with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC25 keynote</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That translates to the following times in the countries where most of our readers live:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST), 8 pm (EET/EEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: at 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Next day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: Next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Timings can be slightly different if Apple holds the event during the period of a couple of weeks when the clocks have changed in the U.S. but not elsewhere (in the spring of 2025 that was between March 9 and March 30, but later in 2025 both the U.S. and U.K. will change back on October 26).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes Apple holds events at different times, for example, in October 2023 the event was held in late afternoon in San Francisco, which meant it was midnight in the U.K. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple doesn’t hold an event and instead just issues a press release that usually happens around 8 am PT, 11 am ET and 4 pm GMT/BST.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does an Apple event last?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-September-iPhone-Event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple September Event\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-September-iPhone-Event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1361w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-September-iPhone-Event.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-September-iPhone-Event.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-September-iPhone-Event.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-September-iPhone-Event.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-September-iPhone-Event.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives. WWDC and the September event tend to be longer keynotes; the spring and late-fall events can be slightly shorter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The September 2024 event was 1 hour 38 minutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple usually hold events?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple holds three or four live or live-streamed events throughout the year. During these events, the company unveils its latest products and plans during a keynote address. They are usually held during similar times of the year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>March/April: Spring event (in 2024 this was held in May)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>June: WWDC – the Worldwide Developers Conference (iOS, macOS previews)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>September: Fall event (iPhone and Apple Watch)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October/November: Late-fall event (Macs and iPads)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This event calendar is by no means set in stone, though, with the spring and October events being less regular. Some years, Apple doesn’t hold a spring event at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Apple held three events: one on Tuesday, May 7, at which it launched new iPads, a keynote to kick off WWDC on June 10, and an event on September 9 at which Apple unveiled the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html\">new iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">AirPods 4</a>. In October 2024 there was no event, but Apple did announce new products (iMac, Mac mini and MacBook Pro) via press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 there were three events: WWDC in June, an iPhone event in September, and Apple’s second fall event on October 30 (or after midnight on October 31 if you weren’t in the U.S.). Similarly, in 2022 Apple held three events: a spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. In other years Apple has held four events though.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Apple launched the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro in September 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will launch at the Apple events in 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the events we expect to see in 2025, and what could launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC keynote 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>June 9 (confirmed)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple uses WWDC each year to unveil details of the latest versions of its operating systems, so in 2025 we’ll get a preview of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2766625/ipados-19-release-date-compatilbity-features-beta.html\">iPadOS 19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">macOS 16</a>, watchOS 12, tvOS 19, HomePod software, and an update to Apple’s realityOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple sometimes announces new hardware at WWDC, usually the high end models targeted at power users, so we could see new Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may see the following new products at WWDC 2025:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">M4 Ultra Mac Pro</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">M4 Pro 32-inch iMac Pro</a> (unlikely)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen</a>/HomeHub device (possible)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote on the Monday, developer events and sessions will run throughout the week.

(The only exception in recent memory was in 2020, as a result of Covid-related production issues. That year the iPhone was announced in October, but there was still a September event.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025 we expect that Apple will unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2736768/apple-watch-series-11-everything-we-know-about-the-2025-models.html\">Apple Watch 11</a>, a new Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch SE. We may also see the M5 arrive in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2599594/m5-ipad-pro-specs-features-design-release.html\">iPad Pro</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomeHub device</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the past few Apple September event dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2024: Monday, September 9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Tuesday, September 13</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Wednesday, September 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday, September 14</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, September 15</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Tuesday, September 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Wednesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Apple’s September events read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s September iPhone event: Date, time, and what will launch.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>October event 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no October event in 2024, with Apple making product announcements via press release. Despite the lack of event in 2024 though, Apple has a president of updating certain Macs in the October time frame, so this may be when we see new Macs running M5 chips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Apple has held a second fall event on the following dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2024: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023: Monday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 13 and Tuesday, November 10 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Thursday, October 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: Thursday, October 16</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: Tuesday, October 22</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Tuesday, October 23</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2011: Tuesday, October 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may update certain Macs to M5 chips at this event, including the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2552098/m5-macbook-pro-design-processor-specs-release.html\">M5 MacBook Pro</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Apple’s October events read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">Apple’s October Event: Date, time and what will launch.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spring event 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Went an idea of when Apple will hold it’s spring event in 2026?
