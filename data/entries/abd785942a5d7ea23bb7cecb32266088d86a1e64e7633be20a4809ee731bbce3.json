Typing \"\":: in the search field after swiping over to the App Library will cause the Springboard to reset, dropping you back at the ‌iPhone‌'s Lock Screen. A respring is not a full reset, and it only takes a few seconds for the ‌iPhone‌ to be functional again.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nTyping the same characters into the Settings app search interface will cause the Settings app to crash, but putting it in a Spotlight search doesn't seem to impact anything. The respring seemed to only happen on devices running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> when we tested, but putting those characters into a search interface on a device running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> does result in some odd behavior, such as the characters disappearing and the Settings app crashing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can actually type in just \"\": and any other character to cause the respring to happen, so it's something related to the first three symbols in a four character sequence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCharacter bugs have in the past spread though Messages and have allowed users to crash the iPhones of others, but this is a much more insignificant issue because the ‌iPhone‌ owner needs to manually type (or paste) the characters into a search interface. There does not appear to be a way to affect an ‌iPhone‌ through Messages or another texting platform.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's likely Apple will address the issue with an iOS update in the near future.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/21/iphone-character-bug-respring/\">PSA: There's a New Character Bug That Can Cause iPhones to Crash</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-theres-a-new-character-bug-that-can-cause-iphones-to-crash.2434102/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"abd785942a5d7ea23bb7cecb32266088d86a1e64e7633be20a4809ee731bbce3","category":"Apple"}
