He clearly took his Tour form with him to Tokyo, finishing third behind Richard Carapaz and Wout van Aert at the end of the 234 km race. But he had mixed results from then on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“After the Tour I was very good one day, not at all the next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Pogačar found his form on Italian roads, finishing fifth behind Sonny Colbrelli (Bahrain-Victorious) at the European Championships in Trento last month, before returning this week and riding to third and fourth at the mid-week races Tre Valli Varesine and Milano-Torino, won by Alessandro De Marchi (Israel Start-Up Nation) and Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as Pogačar appeared at the front in Saturday’s Il Lombardia, his first appearance at the race, he looked every bit the Tour de France champion. No one could keep pace on the Passo di Gamba and in 4 km, he’d gained over 30 seconds. The only man who was willing and/or able to go off in pursuit of Pogačar was Fausto Masnada (Deceuninck-QuickStep), one of the few starters who hails from the finish town of Bergamo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1345686280-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) leads Fausto Masnada (Deceuninck-QuickStep) up the Colle Aperto near the finish of Il Lombardia.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“I didn’t think that after my attack I would come and ride alone. Apparently everyone was broken,” Pogačar explained. “When I heard that Masnada was coming, I knew he was coming. He knows these roads very well. I’ve never ridden here before.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar had been alone for 20 km before Masnada caught him, and even then, he didn’t get any help with the pace-setting, Julian Alaphilippe being in the chase group a minute behind his teammate. Even so, Pogačar’s dominance was unaffected and he was able to raise his arms in celebration for his 13th win of the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s crazy. After all the season it’s crazy to finish the season like this. I’m without words,” Pogačar said. “For me every victory is important. Especially this one because I’ve been dreaming to start Lombardia and to race with the best here in Italy for a long time. Now I’m here and I took the victory, it’s just crazy.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/tadej-pogacar-after-the-tour-i-was-very-good-one-day-not-at-all-the-next/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c584ead5a46366093b21858c7ac4fee511a4b7b86dee32e4d5761732a32cc65a","category":"Cycling"}
