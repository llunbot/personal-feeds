{"title":"Apple Phases Out Lightning Port in iPhone Lineup With iPhone 16e Launch","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-phases-out-lightning-port/","date":1739995807000,"content":"With the launch of the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, Apple discontinued the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>, eliminating the last two <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models that were equipped with a Lightning port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/lightning-connector-feature-blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple no longer manufactures any iPhones with a Lightning port, and all models in the ‌iPhone‌ lineup feature USB-C. Apple does still sell refurbished iPhones that use Lightning, but its main website and retail locations only offer iPhones with USB-C connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new 16e has a USB-C port, as do the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models that Apple also sells. Apple started the transition away from Lightning with the ‌iPhone 15‌ launch in 2023, and it has completed the move to USB-C in less than two years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has already overhauled the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> lineup with USB-C, so Lightning is no longer used for any ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, or Mac. Lightning has almost been phased out entirely, but Apple continues to sell the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> and some legacy cables that have Lightning connectors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will need to offer a small selection of Lightning-based accessories for a few years to come, but we are close to the full sunsetting of the Lightning port and connector.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/\">Lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-phases-out-lightning-port/\">Apple Phases Out Lightning Port in iPhone Lineup With iPhone 16e Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-phases-out-lightning-port-in-iphone-lineup-with-iphone-16e-launch.2449744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f20de9b9a1f3852910646d830ea2d03e6b0b952f2513617079d4d611e8873a93","category":"Apple"}
