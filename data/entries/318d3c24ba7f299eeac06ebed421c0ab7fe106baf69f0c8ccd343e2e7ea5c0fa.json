Apple has not yet acknowledged the Beats Studio Pro headphones, but they were spotted in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a> 13.4 update back in May.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/beats-studio-pro.jpg\" alt width=\"1868\" height=\"1051\" />\r<br />\nThe headphones feature an A2924 model number and an ID of BeatsStudioPro1,1. The Beats Studio Pro will be a new version of the Beats Studio3 over-ear headphones, which are several years old at this point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSoftware code suggested that the Beats Studio Pro headphones will be released in collaboration with Samuel Ross of A-Cold-Wall, who <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90910360/beats-design-samuel-ross-apple\">just joined Beats</a> as a \"principal design consultant.\" The design looks to be largely identical to the Beats Studio3 headphones, but Apple will likely add internal improvements to justify the \"Pro\" moniker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe headphones could feature an updated Apple-designed chip and additions like improved Active Noise Cancellation and a Transparency Mode. Apple also plans to add \"Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>\" support, a feature that is not available in the current Studio3 headphones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are expecting the Beats Studio Pro headphones to be released later this summer, and FCC information usually comes out a few weeks to a month ahead of launch.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/beats-studio-pro-fcc-database/\">Apple's Beats Studio Pro Headphones Listed in FCC Database Ahead of Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-beats-studio-pro-headphones-listed-in-fcc-database-ahead-of-launch.2393638/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"318d3c24ba7f299eeac06ebed421c0ab7fe106baf69f0c8ccd343e2e7ea5c0fa","category":"Apple"}
