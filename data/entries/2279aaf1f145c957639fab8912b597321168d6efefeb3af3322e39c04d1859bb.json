This price is nearly double the device's starting price in the United States. The initiative also is part of Apple's broader strategy to diversify its manufacturing footprint beyond China and reduce its reliance on a single region.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnly the 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 15‌ model is being assembled in Brazil. The ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, Pro, and Pro Max models continue to be imported from China. Brazilian customers can identify whether their ‌iPhone 15‌ was assembled locally by checking the model number, with units produced in Brazil carrying the identifier \"BR/A.\" In contrast, imported units are denoted by \"BE/A\" and \"BZ/A.\" <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brazil/\">Brazil</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/apple-begins-assembling-iphone-15-in-brazil/\">Apple Begins Assembling iPhone 15 in Brazil</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-assembling-iphone-15-in-brazil.2421818/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2279aaf1f145c957639fab8912b597321168d6efefeb3af3322e39c04d1859bb","category":"Apple"}
