Image segmentation is a process in computer vision that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each representing a specific object or area of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of image segmentation is to make an image easier to analyze or process. Meta also sees the technology as being useful for understanding webpage content, augmented reality applications, image editing, and aiding scientific study by automatically localizing animals or objects to track on video.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929377#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929377&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af9f565998a05c064a10abb87fa487b4dd06ef1a1d6ed4d57ebe65979d2500c2","category":"Tech"}
