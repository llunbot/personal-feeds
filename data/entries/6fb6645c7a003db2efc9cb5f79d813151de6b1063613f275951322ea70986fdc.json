This is because the cog focuses all the power from the cranks onto one point in the driver.</p>\n<p>To avoid this, Wheels Manufacturing’s design uses a sleeve that slides onto the driver and covers similar to how a standard cassette would. Once this base sleeve is attached, the cog and spacer slide over it and are secured by a lock ring.</p>\n<p>Wheels Manufacturing say this allows pedal force to be evenly distributed across the freehub body stopping your driver from getting chewed up.</p>\n<h2>One of few options</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wheels Manufacturing Solo-XD on bike\" title=\"Wheels Manufacturing Solo-XD on bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Singlespeed setups are favoured for their simplicity and low maintenance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wheels Manufacturing</i></span></div>\n<p>There are many singlespeed conversion kits on the market for Shimano HG-style freehubs but this is one of only very few options for XD and XDR freehubs.</p>\n<p>The Reverse Component’s XD singlespeed uses a similar CNC’d construction offering a 13-tooth and 14-tooth cog size. The cogs are integrated into the conversion kit and cannot be swapped.</p>\n<p>Gusset also offers its XD 1-ER conversion kit. This uses bolt-on cogs available in a range of sizes from 16-tooth to 22-tooth.</p>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"6fb6645c7a003db2efc9cb5f79d813151de6b1063613f275951322ea70986fdc","category":"Cycling"}
