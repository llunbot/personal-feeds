Johnson wondered whether Google had decided to disable AMP in ‌iOS 15‌ due to the prevalence of Safari extensions that feature AMP-blocking features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>It's a bug specific to iOS 15 that we're working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.</p>— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/1445799446139191298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThat Google search results do not include AMP links in the Safari browser on ‌iOS 15‌ is a bug, according to Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan. In a tweet, Sullivan said that Google is working on a fix and that the issue should be resolved soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor those unfamiliar with AMP, it stands for \"Accelerated Mobile Pages\" and it is a feature that's designed to make webpages load faster on mobile devices. AMP pages are cached, allowing them to be presented to users more quickly, but it's something that is not always popular with users because some website features are disabled when AMP is used.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Google does re-implement AMP links, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-safari-extensions/\">iOS 15 Safari extensions</a> like Amplosion are available to redirect AMP links to standard webpages.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/google-amp-bug-ios-15-safari-fix-coming/\">Google to Fix Bug That Disables Safari AMP Search Results on iOS 15 Devices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-to-fix-bug-that-disables-safari-amp-search-results-on-ios-15-devices.2315738/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fwNnTOhbFnw:A1nVyWiIt_Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fwNnTOhbFnw:A1nVyWiIt_Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fwNnTOhbFnw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0051f2d44d122af74288219a34411f73c6697325ba089d4be3bf278fd37906db","category":"Apple"}
