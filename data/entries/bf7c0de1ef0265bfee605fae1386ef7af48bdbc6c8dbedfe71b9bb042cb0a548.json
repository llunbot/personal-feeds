On the back of the cage, the pads also act as strap guides: they hold the included 450mm straps securely in place when unloaded. As opposed to cages with straps threaded through the frame, the Tarsier’s straps wrap around the entire platform, maximizing cage-to-cargo contact for ultimate stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrated Pads</strong> – Soft molded pads provide grip and wear protection for hard sided objects. The pads can be set to different positions to accommodate both large and small diameter water and fuel bottles.</p>\n<p><strong>Strap Guides</strong> – Integrated strap guides keep straps secure to the cage. They allow the straps to fully wrap around the aluminum frame, maximizing the effective cage width.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy Installation</strong> – Three key-slot bolt holes make transitions easy: mounting bolts never need to be fully removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Removable Foot</strong> – With the lower foot uninstalled, the Tarsier is optimized for extra long cargo. With no loose hardware to keep track of, it’s also an ideal minimal setup.</p>\n<p><strong>Strong and Durable Construction</strong> – Machined from 6061-T6 aluminum for a premium, hard-wearing cargo platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Straps included</strong> – Comes with a pair of 450mm straps which are the perfect length for most loads.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/Cargo/Tarsier\" target=\"_blank\">Revelate Designs</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/revelate-tarsier-cargo-cage/\">Revelate Tarsier Cargo Cage</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"bf7c0de1ef0265bfee605fae1386ef7af48bdbc6c8dbedfe71b9bb042cb0a548","category":"Cycling"}
