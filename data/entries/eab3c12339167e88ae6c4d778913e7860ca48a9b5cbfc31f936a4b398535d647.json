Amazon didn't provide a specific release date but said availability would start with the Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21 smart displays.</p>\n<p>Amazon is hoping Alexa+ will be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/as-alexa-flounders-amazon-hopes-homegrown-generative-ai-can-find-it-revenue/\">a lifeline</a> for its fledgling voice assistant business that has failed to turn a profit.

Exacerbating the problem, generative AI chatbots are a new, shinier approach to AI assistants that have quickly outperformed what people could do with today’s Alexa.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eab3c12339167e88ae6c4d778913e7860ca48a9b5cbfc31f936a4b398535d647","category":"Tech"}
