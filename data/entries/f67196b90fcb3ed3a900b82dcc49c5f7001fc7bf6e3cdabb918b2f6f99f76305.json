However, neither Gurman nor Kuo have offered a more specific launch window for the next-gen earbuds. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest rumor comes from user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrontTron/status/1459000065247219718\">@FronTron</a>, who on Friday revised a previous claim made in August that \"AirPods Pro 2\" will be launched by the second quarter of next year \"at least.\" The leaker now predicts Apple's second-generation AirPods Pro will arrive in Q3 2022. The third quarter traditionally encompasses a 92-day window between July 1 and September 30.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile @FronTron has a very limited track record for accurate leaks, the leaker told <em>MacRumors</em> that the tip comes directly from the supply chain and is based on the same source of theirs that correctly predicted AirPods 3 would be released in late 2021. We were unable to verify the latter claim, therefore the new information should be taken with a grain of salt at this point in time. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has said that Apple is aiming to make the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 more compact by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">eliminating the short stem</a> that sticks out from the bottom. Apple is said to be testing a \"more rounded shape that fills more of a user's ear,\" but getting the hardware of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ into a chassis that's reduced in size has proven difficult, so the plan could be scrapped, cautions Gurman.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>MacRumors</em> received <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/airpods-pro-2-photo-rumor/\">alleged images</a> of the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ that contradict the stemless design rumors, but they're from a source without an established track record and we can't verify their accuracy. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGurman and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Debby Wu reported in May that Apple's second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ will include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/airpods-pro-2-with-sensors-and-fitness-coming-2022/\">updated motion sensors with a focus on fitness tracking</a>. Based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/two-features-coming-to-airpods-pro/\">improvements made to the new AirPods 3</a>, other features that are also likely to appear in the second-generation AirPods Pro include an IPX-4 rated water-resistant MagSafe Charging Case, and all-new skin-detect sensors replacing the existing optical sensors.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/12/airpods-pro-2-release-third-quarter-2022/\">Rumor: AirPods Pro 2 to Launch in Third Quarter of 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-airpods-pro-2-to-launch-in-third-quarter-of-2022.2323042/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JZnYYE6bKGM:oZc2Mu6tLMk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JZnYYE6bKGM:oZc2Mu6tLMk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f67196b90fcb3ed3a900b82dcc49c5f7001fc7bf6e3cdabb918b2f6f99f76305","category":"Apple"}
