Farewell, dear switch. You were a real one, and a lightning strike took you from us too soon.</p>\n<p>I picked up this switch <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/04/ubiquitis-8-port-poe-switch-is-a-solid-complement-for-a-home-unifi-setup/\">back in January 2016</a> when I was ramping up my quest to replace my shaky home Wi-Fi with something a little more enterprise-y. The results were, on the whole, positive (you can read about how that quest turned out in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/enterprise-wi-fi-at-home-part-two-reflecting-on-almost-three-years-with-pro-gear/\">this piece right here</a>, which contains much reflection on the consequences—good and bad—of going overboard on home networking), and this little 8-port switch proved to be a major enabler of the design I settled on.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JT3A9018.jpg\"><img alt=\"Happier times—the old US-8-150W right out of the box, when it was brand new.

Note those two SFP slots at right.</a> </p></div>\n<p>Why? Well, it's a nice enough device—having 802.3af/at and Ubiquiti's 24-volt passive PoE option made it universally compatible with just about anything I wanted to hook up to it. But the key feature was the two SFP slots, which technically make this a 10-port switch. I have a detached garage, and I wanted to hook up some PoE-powered security cameras out there, along with an additional wireless access point. The simplest solution would have been to run Ethernet between the house and the garage, but that's not actually a simple solution at all—running Ethernet underground between two buildings can be <a href=\"https://www.truecable.com/blogs/cable-academy/into-the-great-outdoors-running-ethernet-cable-outside\">electrically problematic</a> unless it's done by professionals with professional tools, and I am definitely not a professional. A couple of estimates from local companies told me that trenching conduit between my house and the garage was going to cost several hundred dollars, which was more than I wanted to spend.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977373#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977373&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"07dd998f32f3714a7691d5335ce6c6a56ee04f19a33bf5ada512cde350b09460","category":"Tech"}
