Rather, the situation required the astronauts to quickly take shelter.</p>\n<p>Had there been a collision during the conjunction, the two spacecraft would have been able to detach from the space station and make an emergency return to Earth. Ultimately that was not necessary, and the astronauts reemerged into the space station later Monday. However, as the crew on board the station prepared for their sleep schedule, Mission Control in Houston asked them to keep as many of the hatches onboard the space station closed for the time being, in case of an unexpected collision during subsequent orbits.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813140#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813140&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ccfd0acf8658cd9c624ce2a1ffe4c195a5fa7f7a7bf0a264b27fd71a2845e55e","category":"Tech"}
