Note that the Stand Pro is only for capturing video - it doesn't work with still photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Stand Pro can follow you on camera as you move around a room, offering 360 degrees of panning and 90 degrees of tilting for video calls and recording content. It is compatible with both the front and rear cameras of the ‌iPhone‌ and can be used in either vertical or landscape orientation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Stand Pro requires an ‌iPhone‌ 12 or later with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>, because it uses a magnetic attachment to hold the ‌iPhone‌ in place. Pairing to an ‌iPhone‌ is done through NFC, and then the Stand Pro can be used with any app that needs the camera. It works with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and more, and turning it on and off is as simple as pushing the single button on the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a built-in battery, the Stand Pro can work for up to five hours so it can be used anywhere. When it is plugged in, it can charge a ‌MagSafe‌ ‌iPhone‌ at up to 15W. Belkin includes a five foot USB-C cable and 30W power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is <a href=\"https://www.belkin.com/auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit/P-MMA008.html\">available from Belkin</a> for $180.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/\">Belkin</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/belkin-stand-pro-hands-on/\">Testing Belkin's Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-belkins-auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit.2420228/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0326c254f3e5b3a7f755062bf3f7b362c78f7a99ad1cb02771dbaa3690b16c5a","category":"Apple"}
