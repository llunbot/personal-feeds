{"title":"Meta Releases New AI Assistant Powered by Llama 3 Model","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133808/meta-ai-assistant-llama-3-chatgpt-openai-rival","date":1713488918000,"content":"\n<p>Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ChatGPT kicked off the AI chatbot race. Meta is determined \nto win it. </p>\n\n<p>To that end: the Meta AI assistant, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23891128/meta-ai-assistant-characters-whatsapp-instagram-connect\">introduced last \nSeptember</a>, is now being integrated into the search box of \nInstagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It’s also going to \nstart appearing directly in the main Facebook feed. You can still \nchat with it in the messaging inboxes of Meta’s apps. And for the \nfirst time, it’s now accessible via a standalone website at \n<a href=\"http://meta.ai/\">Meta.ai</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For Meta’s assistant to have any hope of being a real ChatGPT \ncompetitor, the underlying model has to be just as good, if not \nbetter. That’s why Meta is also announcing Llama 3, the next major \nversion of its foundational open-source model. Meta says that \nLlama 3 outperforms competing models of its class on key \nbenchmarks and that it’s better across the board at tasks like \ncoding. Two smaller Llama 3 models are being released today, both \nin the Meta AI assistant and to outside developers, while a much \nlarger, multimodal version is arriving in the coming months. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I keep circling back to the notion that OpenAI has no moat. ChatGPT is certainly the best-known LLM, and perhaps still the best, but I don’t think that’s any more of a long-term competitive advantage than some company in 1986 having “the best C compiler”. What’s needed are ways to bring LLMs to users. To give them purpose, in products. That’s what Meta is doing, by integrating their AI into all of their major products.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/18/meta-ai\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b1b04620090c8b1ad257ba98c10347304a7885ddd6bf895f56f1a4cee3b23443","category":"Tech"}
