They keep a hooked bead, maximizing tire options and allowing you to run it with tubes, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of reynolds BL60 DB aero road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reynolds-60mm-DB-aero-road-wheels-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rims max out at a very broad 34.25mm width about 1/3 of the way down the rim from the tire bead, then curve inward toward the tire with a constant arc. It’s surprisingly distinct from the varied profile of the 46mm models, and Reynolds says it provides excellent crosswind stability, letting you stay in the aero tuck longer and easier, improving overall aerodynamics for a faster overall ride than with wheels that might suffer more from wayward gusts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1235\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset.jpg\" alt=\"reynolds BL60 Pro DB aero road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset-297x183.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset-800x494.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset-120x74.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset-768x474.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Reynolds-BL-60-Pro-DB-Wheelset-1536x948.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-level BL60 (for Black Label) Pro DB and Expert DB models use the same CR6 carbon rim layup for the lightest weights, while a budget-friendly AR60 DB uses a lower-level CR3 carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro model (above) uses their custom Industry Nine Torch Road hubs with Sapim CX Ray spokes (20 front, 24 rear) with alloy nipples to come in at just 1,500g for the set.
