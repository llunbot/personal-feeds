But it looks like the M1 Air may live on, at least for a while—US retailer Walmart made a point of <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/03/15/walmart-brings-the-popular-macbook-air-with-the-m1-chip-to-its-shelves\">announcing today</a> that it would carry and sell the M1 Air in its online store and at “select” retail locations for <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889\">a much-lowered price of $699</a>.</p>\n<p>This is lower than the $999 that Apple was asking for the laptop just a few weeks ago, and it's lower than the $759 that the M1 Air goes for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FGN63LL/A/refurbished-133-inch-macbook-air-apple-m1-chip-with-8%E2%80%91core-cpu-and-7%E2%80%91core-gpu-space-gray?fnode=926e68841654b8692963f48fa3af0ba070874c77faa809931a6262f2a2354513a8b6a73fe27bae735a134621980a50b20831429d6a57f610c471db67be8a8d2c2a7e2b420fec79092cc8db9585866c3f\">in Apple’s refurbished store</a>. These prices are all for the base configuration of the M1 Air, with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage. Walmart offers all three color finishes for the M1 Air—silver, gold, and space gray—but doesn’t directly sell any versions with more RAM or storage.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t the Air config we’d recommend to most enthusiasts—for them, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/review-apples-efficient-m3-macbook-airs-are-just-about-as-good-as-laptops-get/\">an M3 Air</a> or a refurbished M2 model with more RAM and storage come with enough benefits to be worth the extra cost. But it is a surprisingly low price for what remains a solid entry-level laptop, especially given that Walmart doesn’t offer any other Macs in its stores (other Macs on Walmart’s website are available from third-party sellers).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010465#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010465&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"775fffc3aebca9b877ca1561031418254f63ecff04a112ded5e8a61654e58abc","category":"Tech"}
