The latest iOS 18.1 beta does not have the feature enabled at the current time, but it is hidden in the update and Apple could potentially activate it in a future iOS 18.1 beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/hearing-assistance-airpods-1.jpg\" width=\"2360\" height=\"1640\" />\r<br />\nWe were able to access the hidden ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 Hearing Assistance feature set in the fifth iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 betas, and we tested it out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/whats-new-airpods.jpg\" width=\"1142\" height=\"1319\" />\r<br />\nWhen Hearing Assistance launches, users will be prompted to take a hearing test or upload an audiogram from an audiologist. Apple says the results will be used to turn on a hearing aid feature for those with mild to moderate hearing loss, but for all users, it can be used to make sound adjustments to improve music, video, and call clarity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/hearing-assistance-airpods-test.jpg\" width=\"2360\" height=\"1640\" />\r<br />\nThe test takes approximately five minutes to complete, and it prompts users to tap the screen each time they hear a tone. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 are only recommended for mild to moderate hearing loss, and those with more serious hearing loss likely won't be able to use the Hearing Aid feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airpods-hearing-test-tone.jpg\" width=\"2360\" height=\"1640\" />\r<br />\nAfter the hearing test, users will have the option to turn on the Hearing Aid option if it is required. Hearing Aid adjusts the voices and sounds around the user to account for the tones and frequencies that are not able to be heard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/hearing-assistance-hearing-aids.jpg\" width=\"2360\" height=\"1640\" />\r<br />\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-fda-authorization/\">already received FDA authorization</a> for the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid, and it could be rolled out at any time. Apple has said the feature will come out this fall, so it would make sense for it to be introduced in a future iOS 18.1 beta.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/apple-airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-feature/\">Apple Gearing Up to Add Hearing Aid Feature to AirPods Pro 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-gearing-up-to-add-hearing-aid-feature-to-airpods-pro-2.2437861/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"002c130522df2ce57ee33b02c2d359eb60a10df5236f9416a497256c47ef236b","category":"Apple"}
