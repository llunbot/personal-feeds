She even spent around three months on the lam, dodging police as they tried to execute a civil arrest warrant. During her time as a fugitive, police memorably reported that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/woman-with-untreated-tb-is-on-the-lam-took-city-bus-to-casino/\">she took a city bus to go to a casino</a>.</p>\n<p>The woman, identified only as V.N. in court documents, had court orders to get treatment for her tuberculosis infection beginning in January of 2022. She refused to comply as the court renewed the orders on a monthly basis and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/us-woman-headed-to-jail-for-refusing-tb-treatment-for-over-a-year/\">held at least 17 hearings</a> on the matter. The judge in her case issued an arrest warrant in March of 2023, but V.N. evaded law enforcement. She was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/woman-with-untreated-tb-finally-in-custody-held-in-negative-pressure-room/\">finally arrested in June</a> of last year and spent 23 days getting court-ordered treatment behind bars before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/woman-who-went-on-the-lam-with-untreated-tb-is-now-out-of-the-slammer/\">being released with conditions</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038901#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038901&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"947b2f41c30d76c6eff0b69f9822fd33d876d16ae7cac730730dc53f8b3d553e","category":"Tech"}
