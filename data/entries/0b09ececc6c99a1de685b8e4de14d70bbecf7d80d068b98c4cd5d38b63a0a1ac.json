{"title":"Apple Devices May Learn to Ignore ‘Hey Siri’ Command From TV Ads","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/07/apple-tv-ads-hey-siri/","date":1732032051000,"content":"\n<p>Filipe Espósito, writing at 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple introduced the “Hey Siri” command with iOS 8 to let users\neasily interact with the virtual assistant without having to press\nany buttons. However, over the years, this has resulted in Siri\nbeing mistakenly triggered when the command is spoken on a TV ad.\nBut Apple is finally working on a fix for this. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The new AdBlocker framework is linked to ShazamKit, which is the\nAPI for apps to use Shazam — the song identification platform\nacquired by Apple in 2018. At the same time, the framework also\nlinks to the process responsible for managing the “Siri” and “Hey\nSiri” voice commands on Apple devices.</p>\n\n<p>Code suggests that “AdBlocker” will download audio fingerprints\nfrom Apple’s servers and then use the Shazam API to match them\nagainst audio captured by the device’s microphones using the Hey\nSiri API. When certain audios match, the new framework will\ntemporarily disable Siri’s trigger commands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clever clever.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/19/hey-siri-shazam-smarts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0b09ececc6c99a1de685b8e4de14d70bbecf7d80d068b98c4cd5d38b63a0a1ac","category":"Tech"}
