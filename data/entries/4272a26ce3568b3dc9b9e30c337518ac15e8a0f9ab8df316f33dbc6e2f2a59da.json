Given that we haven't tracked that rare sale again, we definitely recommend jumping on this deal if you've been waiting for a deal on the AirPods Pro 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 for $199.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis model of the AirPods Pro can charge via Lightning, Qi, or an Apple Watch charger. We're expecting Apple to introduce a model that adds USB-C charging to the AirPods Pro 2 next week, but it could be a while before those models are discounted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/deals-get-the-airpods-pro-2-2/\">Deals: Get the AirPods Pro 2 for Low Price of $199 ($50 Off)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-get-the-airpods-pro-2-for-low-price-of-199-50-off.2400740/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4272a26ce3568b3dc9b9e30c337518ac15e8a0f9ab8df316f33dbc6e2f2a59da","category":"Apple"}
