The multiplayer-only shooter will now hit stores on November 19, the publisher said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Citing the complications of developing games in a work-from-home environment during a global pandemic—by now a familiar challenge for the countless game makers that have had to delay other high-profile 2021 games—DICE assured fans that the team is working on finishing touches rather than dealing with any kind of development trouble. The developer also reiterated that there would be updates later this month regarding <em>2042</em>'s open beta. In other words, this is pandemic business as usual.</p>\n\n<p>After <em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s reveal during EA's June E3 news blitz, the publisher announced that the game will feature three modes, none of which are battle royale-related. \"All-Out Warfare,\" the traditional <em>BF</em> deathmatch mode, is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/battlefield-2042-will-host-128-player-combat-on-pc-next-gen-consoles-oct-22/\">finally upgrading to 128 players</a> on current-gen consoles and PC. \"Battlefield Portal\" is a mashup game that lets players customize matches with elements of <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, <em>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</em>, and <em>Battlefield 3</em> inside <em>2042</em> maps. \"Hazard Zone\" is an alleged squad-based mode that EA has thus far been mum on. Today's announcement didn't specify whether all three modes would launch with the game.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795959#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795959&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b433776f619bd673bd9449f75ce2093bf99207b57245dd9cc59026677cfc35c","category":"Tech"}
