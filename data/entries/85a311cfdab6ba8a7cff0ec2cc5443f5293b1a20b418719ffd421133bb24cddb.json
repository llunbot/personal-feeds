In the U.S., prices start at $1,099, down from $1,299 brand new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the usual accessories are included in the box with refurbished Macs. For the iMac, this includes a Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, USB-C power adapter, USB-C cable, and power cord. Apple's refurbished products come in a more plain white box.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says it puts refurbished Macs through \"full functionality testing\" and a \"thorough cleaning process and inspection,\" and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple.
