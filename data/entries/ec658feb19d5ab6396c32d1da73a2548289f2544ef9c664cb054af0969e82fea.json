AMD expects both bugs to be fixed later this month.</p>\n<p>The first issue AMD has identified increases L3 cache latency by up to three times, affecting apps that rely on fast memory performance. AMD says that most affected apps will slow down by between 3 and 5 percent but that some \"games commonly used for eSports\" could see dips of between 10 and 15 percent. AMD says that a Windows update will fix this issue later this month, so as long as you're checking for and installing Windows updates regularly, you won't need to do anything special to resolve the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The second bug is related to an AMD processor feature that tries to use your fastest individual CPU cores when running lightly threaded tasks rather than treating all cores the same. AMD doesn't put a number on this one but says the problem \"may be more detectable\" in processors with eight or more cores and a 65 W or higher TDP. This would include most 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000-series Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9 desktop CPUs and APUs. AMD says that a \"software update,\" not a Windows update, will be released to fix the problem later in October, so you may need to install new AMD chipset drivers or some other software to get the fix.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801973#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801973&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ec658feb19d5ab6396c32d1da73a2548289f2544ef9c664cb054af0969e82fea","category":"Tech"}
