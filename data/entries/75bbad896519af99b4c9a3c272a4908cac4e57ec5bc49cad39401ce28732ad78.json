It can also be accessed <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/station/discovery-station/ra.q-GAI6IDA1ZmYwZGUyZjI2ZTcwOGMxYWJiNzBmZjc1N2FhOTVm\">through this link</a> for those who do not yet see it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-music-discovery.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/07/apple-music-debuts-new-algorithmic-discovery-station-radio\">AppleInsider</a></em>, the radio station appears to play songs of a similar style to songs that are in your personal library and that you have listened to and liked in the past, but it chooses songs you don't have in playlists or your library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no documentation on the Discovery Station as of yet, so full details on how the algorithm works to suggest music are unknown. Apple may promote the Discovery Station at some point in the future, but from our testing, it looks like a good way to discover music that is suited to your individual taste.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-music-discovery-station/\">Apple Music Gains New Algorithmic 'Discovery Station'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-gains-new-algorithmic-discovery-station.2398016/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"75bbad896519af99b4c9a3c272a4908cac4e57ec5bc49cad39401ce28732ad78","category":"Apple"}
