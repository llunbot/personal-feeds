One vulnerability allows the attacker access to low-privileged OS resources, where code can be executed or sensitive data can be read. A second vulnerability elevates that code execution or file access to OS resources reserved for password storage or other sensitive operations. The value of so-called local privilege escalation vulnerabilities, accordingly, has increased in recent years.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Windows</h2>\n<p>The Windows vulnerability <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonasLyk/status/1417205166172950531\">came to light</a> by accident on Monday when a researcher observed what he believed was a coding regression in a beta version of the upcoming Windows 11. The researcher found that the contents of the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-sam\">security account manager</a>—the database that stores user accounts and security descriptors for users on the local computer—could be read by users with limited system privileges.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781750#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781750&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e83d4a3ae848d03f6dba23ac45fff5074f9622678a1e7058793755f82a76c4dc","category":"Tech"}
