Compared to its 32GB and 64GB companions, the 16GB model was only offered in a single silver color and lacked a rear camera or loop.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple followed up the fifth-generation ‌iPod touch‌ with the sixth-generation in the summer of 2015. Compared to the previous generation, the newer model featured improved performance and the removal of the wrist strap. Since the seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ released in 2019, Apple has not yet updated its iconic product.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple classifies products that have been discontinued for at least seven years as \"obsolete,\" meaning that they cannot receive any hardware service from Apple or its service providers.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">vintage and obsolete</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/16gb-ipod-touch-obsolete/\">Apple Obsoletes 16GB Fifth-Generation iPod touch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-obsoletes-16gb-fifth-generation-ipod-touch.2310250/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MyOAc4DkDDg:_cDUTjg60pc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MyOAc4DkDDg:_cDUTjg60pc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MyOAc4DkDDg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"20ce40cc1678094735334abe02876e4974c4dd441787efbddd830ae97c494ea4","category":"Apple"}
