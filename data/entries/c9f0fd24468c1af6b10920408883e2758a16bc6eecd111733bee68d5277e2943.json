It's also suitable for use with the mini-LED display of the new MacBook Pro models and all manner of iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThose who were hoping to get a Polishing Cloth with their MacBook Pros and who have not already ordered may be out of luck, as initial supplies have sold out. If ordered today, the Polishing Cloth will not arrive until November 18 to November 24, which is quite a long wait for a piece of cloth.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/apple-polishing-cloth-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172\">support document</a> on cleaning Apple products recommends a soft, lint-free cloth and minimal wiping. Cleaners should not be used, but if a deep cleaning is required, a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol solution can be used to moisten the cloth.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/10/apple-pro-display-xdr-cleaning-cloth/\">shipping a similar Polishing Cloth</a> with the nano-texture Pro Display XDR since its launch. Based on the instructions provided with that cloth, the new cloth can be hand washed with dish soap and water should it become dirty.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs of now, the Polishing Cloth is not available in Apple's retail stores, though retail locations could potentially begin offering stock next week when the MacBook Pro models launch.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/polishing-cloth/\">Polishing Cloth</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-polishing-cloth-sold-out-november/\">Apple's New $19 Polishing Cloth is Sold Out Until Late November</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-19-polishing-cloth-is-sold-out-until-late-november.2318047/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=K8EOOhdLOQ0:t_bHdEAsyB0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=K8EOOhdLOQ0:t_bHdEAsyB0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/K8EOOhdLOQ0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c9f0fd24468c1af6b10920408883e2758a16bc6eecd111733bee68d5277e2943","category":"Apple"}
