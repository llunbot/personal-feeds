The ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ is available in a white color, and it appears to be covered with a silicone coating. Based on images of the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, the accessory has an 11.13Wh battery, which will offer a partial charge for Apple's iPhones. For comparison, the ‌iPhone 12‌ has a 10.78Wh battery, but Qi charging is inefficient, resulting in power loss.   \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile on the go, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ can charge an ‌iPhone‌ at 5W, but plugged in, it can be charged at up to 15W. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ and the ‌iPhone‌ can be charged at the same time. Apple says that a Lightning cable can be plugged into the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ for up to 15W of wireless charging, and with a 20W charger, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ and the ‌iPhone‌ will charge even faster. Apple recommends a 20W or higher USB-C Power Adapter and USB-C to Lightning Cable for charging the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ can also be charged through the ‌iPhone‌ if the ‌iPhone‌ is plugged into a power source. Apple suggests users might want to charge this way if the ‌iPhone‌ needs to connect to another device while charging, such as wired <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> or transferring photos to a Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174\">a support document</a> for the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌, Apple says that iOS 14.7 or later is required to use the accessory. Charging status can be viewed on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> or in the Today View with the Batteries widget. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Apple, the ‌iPhone‌ might get slightly warm when it charges. To extend battery lifespan, if it's too warm, the software might limit charging above 80 percent, with the ‌iPhone‌ resuming charging when it cools down. A charge management feature helps to maintain battery health when the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ is connected to power for prolonged periods of time, and with Optimized Battery Charging turned on, users will see a notification on the Lock Screen letting them know when the ‌iPhone‌ is fully charged. Tapping on the notification and choosing \"Charge Now\" will force a charge. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThose who use a Leather ‌iPhone‌ case with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> should be aware that the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ may show imprints from compression of the leather, which Apple says is normal. For anyone concerned about the imprints, Apple suggests using a non-leather case. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ is priced at $99 and will begin delivering to customers on July 19.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-launches-99-magsafe-battery-pack/\">Apple Launches $99 MagSafe Battery Pack</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-99-magsafe-battery-pack.2304134/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gBpXI5yoP0I:cTpsZLphdcE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gBpXI5yoP0I:cTpsZLphdcE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gBpXI5yoP0I\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2df18c1c41f2486eaa383310b94cb6da7edca0c39b13e87443590c7b6ce4bba0","category":"Apple"}
