Which means you can get it with these new ALPHA solid pulley discs, or their traditional 5-spoke machined alloy wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1300\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01.jpg\" alt=\"ceramicspeed OSPW RS alpha solid wheels pulley cage for road and gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01-297x193.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01-800x520.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01-120x78.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01-768x499.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-01-1536x998.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALPHA discs have their patent-pending ADR active debris remover design, which uses small angled grooves surrounding the bearing covers to send water and grit flying away from the bearings as they spin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALPHA discs also use an alloy wheel with composite teeth. Those teeth are 5x more durable than the machined alloy ones on their original models, are quieter, and cause less wear on your chain. CeramicSpeed says they haven’t actually tested for reduced chain wear, but they do note that the teeth last much longer and, you know, you’re not running metal on metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1232\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02.jpg\" alt=\"ceramicspeed OSPW RS alpha solid wheels poster\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02-297x203.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02-800x548.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02-120x82.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02-768x526.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ceramicspeed-OSPW-RS-solid-wheel-pulley-cage-road-gravel-02-1536x1051.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting March 26, they’ll be available for all SRAM and Shimano 12-speed road and gravel derailleurs. They have 13/19 (upper lower) tooth counts for Shimano, and 15/19 tooth counts for SRAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also new is a Lifetime warranty on it, which they say is possible because the new design is so strong and durable. MSRP €579 ($669) with the solid Alpha Disc, and €529 ($599) with the alloy pulleys, which are available in a range of anodized colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ceramicspeed.com\" target=\"_blank\">CeramicSpeed.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ceramicspeed-ospw-rs/\">CeramicSpeed OSPW-RS Brings Solid ALPHA Pulley Discs to Road &amp; Gravel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"21df984a7e6305937ae00aa0a92595ba9be0ce7b3afa697c5af22be3b54346eb","category":"Cycling"}
