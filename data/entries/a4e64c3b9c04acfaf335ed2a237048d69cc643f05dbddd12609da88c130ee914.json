Amazon and Meta were both down 9%. Nike is down over 13%. From CNBC’s corresponding story on just <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html\">how the White House computed the “tariff” rates</a> it claims for various countries:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade\ndeficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates\nfor individual countries.</p>\n\n<p>Such methodology doesn’t necessarily align with the conventional\napproach for calculating tariffs and implies the U.S. would have\nlooked at only the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in\nservices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Such methodology doesn’t necessarily align with the conventional approach” is an overlong euphemism for “The president literally doesn’t understand what tariffs are.” James Surowiecki was seemingly <a href=\"https://x.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1907559189234196942\">the first person to figure out the White House’s nonsensical formula</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just figured out where these fake tariff rates come from. They\ndidn’t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as\nthey say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our\ntrade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s\nexports to us.</p>\n\n<p>So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its\nexports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64%, which Trump claims\nis the tariff rate Indonesia charges us. What extraordinary\nnonsense this is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don’t rack your brain trying to make sense out of the nonsensical.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a4e64c3b9c04acfaf335ed2a237048d69cc643f05dbddd12609da88c130ee914","category":"Tech"}
