{"title":"PSA: Your new iPhone 15 needs an update and a Polishing Cloth","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2079782/iphone-15-transfer-stuck-on-apple-logo-titanium-discoloration.html","date":1695657090000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2078885/new-iphone-15-do-these-things-first.html\">iPhone 15 officially arrives today</a> and people all around the world will be eager to get up and running as soon as possible. But there are a couple of things you should know if you’re one of the happy early adopters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has issued two support documents that address potential issues with the iPhone 15. The first could come into play almost immediately: Apple yesterday pushed out an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2079324/ios-17-update-iphone-15-bug-fixes-security-updates.html\">iOS 17.0.2</a> update that specifically addresses “bug fixes and security updates” in the iPhone 15. It’s not pre-installed on the first batch of iPhones, so your new iPhone will need an update before you can use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not sure what the update specifically fixes, but it appears to be somewhat major. In a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213933&amp;xcust=1-1-2079782-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">new support document</a> titled, “If your new iPhone gets stuck on the Apple logo when you transfer from your previous device,” Apple supplies reset instructions that specifically mention the iPhone 15, so more than a few people are expected to experience such a problem. We assume the stuck logo and update are related, so if you’re prompted to update your iPhone during setup, don’t skip it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other support document is less serious but just as concerning for people who bought an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. In <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123&amp;xcust=1-1-2079782-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">an article about cleaning your iPhone</a>, Apple notes that the iPhone 15 Pro models may need a little extra attention: “For iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the oil from your skin might temporarily alter the color of the outside band. Wiping your iPhone with a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth will restore the original look.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you were constantly wiping off fingerprints from your stainless steel iPhone, it seems like the iPhone 15 Pro’s new titanium sides will be just as frustrating. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MM6F3AM-A-Polishing-Cloth/dp/B09JQRJ15H?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple sells a solution for just $19</a>. </p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e0246cf490f3eba0e6f756394af8a936ac79260b51ecb5424f6295c033297bbd","category":"Apple"}
