PC-to-Mac mode follows PC-to-iPad mode, which was introduced in October. Thanks to the updated software, any old Mac or ‌iPad‌ can now be used as a secondary display with either a PC or a Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with PC-to-Mac mode, the update introduces support for 4K and 5K resolutions. Computers that have a 4K or 5K display can be used as a secondary display at their full resolution, with the USB-C Luna Display required for this functionality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThere's also a new Teleprompter Mode for the PC, Office Mode for PC users, and Magic Keyboard Support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> owners. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad can now be used with an ‌iPad‌ when using Luna Display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe USB-C Luna Display that works interchangeably with Macs and PCs can be <a href=\"https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/\">purchased for $129.99</a>, though there is a discount for the next two days that drops the price to $97.50. The discount will show up when the Luna Display is added to the cart for purchase.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luna-display/\">Luna Display</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/01/luna-display-pc-to-mac-mode/\">Luna Display Gains PC-to-Mac Mode, 5K Support and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/luna-display-gains-pc-to-mac-mode-5k-support-and-more.2325796/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GAfP4yUYfDA:1Io6eozgvyY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GAfP4yUYfDA:1Io6eozgvyY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f04ea8420645f34234509211a76ac55f94c1a95226eb4dd48ec57775de18d48","category":"Apple"}
