This emergent gravity idea might hold the key to rewriting one of the fundamental forces of nature—and it could explain the mysterious nature of dark matter.</p>\n<p>But in the years since its original proposal, it has not held up well to either experiment or further theoretical inquiry. Emergent gravity may not be a right answer. But it is a clever one, and it's still worth considering, as it may hold the seeds of a greater understanding.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/emergent-gravity-may-be-a-dead-idea-but-its-not-a-bad-one/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/emergent-gravity-may-be-a-dead-idea-but-its-not-a-bad-one/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Paul Sutter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"269c8bf0841db759822c8d2020942154d86bce77fd6a46701176cf8eec2d8d8e","category":"Tech"}
