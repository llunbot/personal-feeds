It not only looks good, but thanks to Apple revealing that it uses 100% recycled gold plating and tin soldering in the printed circuit boards, plus 100% recycled cobalt in the MagSafe connector and 90% recycled steel in the battery tray, the 15-inch MacBook Air is also better for the environment than many of its rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>15.3-inch Liquid Retina display</li><li>500 nits </li><li>Supports up to 1 billion colors</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, one of the main selling points of new MacBook Air is the 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display. This marks the largest MacBook Air we’ve seen so far, and with over 500 nits of brightness and support for up to 1 billion colors, it should deliver a very pleasing experience for users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the same mystery PC as with its dimension claims, Apple states that the panel is twice the resolution and 25% brighter than the Windows-based device.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Colors schemes of the new 15-inch MacBook Air \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-colours.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>M2 chip</li><li>Up to 24GB fast unified memory</li><li>18 hour battery life</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of the new Air is Apple’s M2 chip, which boasts an 8-core CPU (4x performance, 4x efficiency), plus a 10-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine for blazing fast speeds that have already impressed us on the 13-inch MacBook Air M2. There’s support for up to 24GB of fast unified memory, with the M2 capable of delivering 100GB/s of memory bandwidth so you’ll get the most out of those GBs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been holding onto an older Air and are considering upgrading, then the fact that Apple says its new model is 12x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air might be the thing that tips the balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the fact that Apple says the M2 chip allows for better energy efficiency, with the new 15-inch MacBook Air having a battery life of up to 18 hours, even with that bright, large and crisp display.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Factsheet about the new 15-inch MacBook Air \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15-MacBook-Air-FACTSHEET.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sound and vision</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1080p FaceTIme HD camera</li><li>Six-speaker array</li><li>Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Air gets the upgraded 1080p FaceTime HD camera that appeared on the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480214/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-pro-review.html\">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, as well as the six-speaker array (two tweeters and two pairs of force-cancelling woofers) that also appeared on the latter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s support for Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio, so while the device might be thin, the sound should have a bit more body on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price and availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple made the 15-inch MacBook Air available immediately after the announcement, with prices starting at $1,299/£1,389, plus it also adjusted the other Air models so that the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 now starts at $1,099/£1,149 and the M1 model stays in the lineup at $999/£999.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9bd65c53948d9c35d8b399e184a842159e1a96dbe1106181b3aa7fea1fe12568","category":"Apple"}
