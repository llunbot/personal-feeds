But Apple has now terminated that Swedish developer account in a move Epic <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account\">says</a> is a \"serious violation of the DMA [that] shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices.\"</p>\n<h2>No competing App Store for you</h2>\n<p>Epic is referring there to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/eu-to-regulate-gatekeepers-in-crackdown-on-google-apple-amazon-facebook/\">the Digital Markets Act</a>, the European regulation that has forced Apple to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/\">officially allow sideloaded apps on European iOS devices</a> for the first time. Since Apple announced its DMA compliance plans in January, though, many third-party developers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/big-tech-is-extremely-unimpressed-by-apples-eu-app-store-changes/\">have loudly complained</a> about the stringent terms Apple is imposing on companies that want to establish alternative App Stores on iOS devices. Epic Games was among those public complainants, with CEO Tim Sweeney <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1750589570880516402\">publicly calling</a> Apple's policies \"a devious new instance of Malicious Compliance\" full of \"hot garbage.\"</p>\n<p>Epic said Apple denied its request for a DMA consultation that could have helped streamline its plans to return to iOS. Despite this, in February Epic signaled a willingness to jump through Apple's hoops, using a newly approved developer account for Epic Games Sweden AB as a way to \"start developing the Epic Games Store on iOS soon\" ahead of a planned 2024 launch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008396#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008396&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b4933b71ce7e73e3f0c08a6129f0d949214542b06cee7591c66e35e3cb9fef6","category":"Tech"}
