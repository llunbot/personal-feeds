Apple says the feature is intended for individuals aged 22 years or older who have been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe AFib History feature received FDA clearance in the United States just prior to its announcement by Apple, after being validated in a clinical study. The MDDT program under which the feature was <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/178230/download?attachment\">approved</a> today is the FDA's method of qualifying tools that medical device sponsors can choose to use in the development and evaluation of medical devices.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the FDA, the Atrial Fibrillation History feature is:\r<br />\n<ul><li>The first digital health technology qualified under the MDDT program, providing a non-invasive way to check estimates of atrial fibrillation (AFib) burden within clinical studies.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Designed to be used as a biomarker test to help evaluate estimates of AFib burden as a secondary effectiveness endpoint within clinical studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of cardiac ablation devices to treat.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Designed to be used throughout the clinical study, both before and after cardiac ablation devices, to monitor a study participantâ€™s weekly estimate of AFib burden.</li></ul><em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.myhealthyapple.com/fda-qualifies-afib-history-mddt/\">MyHealthyApple.com</a>.)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fda/\">FDA</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/apple-watch-afib-history-evaluate-medical-devices/\">Apple Watch AFib History Feature Qualified by FDA to Evaluate Medical Devices</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-afib-history-feature-qualified-by-fda-to-evaluate-medical-devices.2425302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"89f93c303c25e45f2097d11522c5f66febf581a42073cad334eaff14b18c49c0","category":"Apple"}
