Here’s what I found on day 1.</p>\n<h2>Aryen Egretta RD Sprint T-70</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505912-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>I had never seen anything quite like this, and I’m assuming most of you haven’t either.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505910-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption>Hopefully, they will work on their welding.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<p>But there is a purpose behind the design of the Egretta RD Sprint T-70, an Aryen representative told me. This bike was made for the Japanese market, where space in apartments is at a premium. Aryen wanted a bike similarly fast to a road bike, so it added in a massive 70-tooth chainring to account for the compact wheels.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505908-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption><span>That’s a big chainring.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The frame has been overbuilt to make it super stiff to create a more road bike like feel. But for all the unusual design features, the thing that almost caught me most off guard was the downtube shifter.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505911-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption>You don’t see downtube shifters much these days.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<h2>Hidden cable lock</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505775-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>I wouldn’t trust my bike out of sight with this cable lock for very long, but the product is super convenient, and far better than nothing. Pop by the cafe and pull this Yung Great International, Co. lock out of your handlebars, and you have a quick, convenient, always on hand option for locking your bike when your attention turns to contemplating the important question in life: cappuccino or cortado?</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505777-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<h2>BTP woven bartape</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505820-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>I can’t say a woven material is up there on my shortlist of best things to make bartape out of, but it sure does make for nice looking designs. Dealing with the stench that sweat build up will bring? Not so nice.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505822-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505821-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<h2>Whoever decided to secure cable cutters with fishing wire</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505784-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>And award-winning ones from the Taipei Cycle d&amp;i awards competition at that.</p>\n<p>I mean, you can’t just expect me to see cable in front of a cable cutter and not cut it, can you?</p>\n<p>Oh, you can?</p>\n<p>Luckily Taiwan is a very honest place.</p>\n<h2>Tomdeer Ghost TG2 adjustable temple sunglasses</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8256-1340x1005.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"1005\" /></figure>\n<p>Well designed sunglasses should probably just fit correctly without needing to adjust temple arms. But nevertheless, Tomdeer introduces extra control over the fit of the Ghost TG2 with these adjustable temple sunglasses.</p>\n<h2>Tino reusable zip ties</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505667-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>This one feels so obvious, yet here I am, using regular zip ties like a sucker. I’ll be adding some of these reusable zip ties to my toolbox and saving the annoyance that comes with cutting them off when no longer needed.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505668-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>Check back to <em>CyclingTips </em>all week for daily coverage from the Taipei Cycle Show 2023.</p>","author":"Will Tracy","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"86ad3955a465b6e8e80748b90d04b3ea7f072c961479bb7032d89695b4efaea7","category":"Cycling"}
