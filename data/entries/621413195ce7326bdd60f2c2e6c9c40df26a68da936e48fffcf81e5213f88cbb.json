Apple went on to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/27/apple-removes-ipod-nano-ipod-shuffle/\">discontinue the iPod nano and iPod shuffle</a> entirely in 2017.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple considers a device to be \"obsolete\" once seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Once a device is obsolete, it is no longer eligible for repair at an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider, with the only exception being MacBook battery replacements for up to a 10-year period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also added the iPhone 6 to its obsolete products list today. Apple had already classified the larger iPhone 6 Plus as obsolete <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/apple-says-iphone-6-plus-is-now-obsolete/\">in April</a>, but the smaller iPhone 6 had remained available through resellers in select countries for longer, so it only became obsolete now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast, Apple added the 2017 model of the 12-inch MacBook and the sixth-generation iPad to its vintage products list today. Apple considers a device to be \"vintage\" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple might offer to repair a vintage product, but only if parts remain available.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/obsolete-ipods/\">Apple Says Final iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle Models Are Now Obsolete</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-final-ipod-nano-and-ipod-shuffle-models-are-now-obsolete.2439535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"621413195ce7326bdd60f2c2e6c9c40df26a68da936e48fffcf81e5213f88cbb","category":"Apple"}
