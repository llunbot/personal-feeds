Instead, the report speculates that the device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However,\r<br />\nall three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems quite possible too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumored features for the fourth-generation iPhone SE include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The device is expected to be similar to the base iPhone 14, although reports said it would have only a single rear camera, and it might share the iPhone 16's rear-panel manufacturing process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe recently published an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-4/\">iPhone SE 4 rumor recap</a> with all potential features and other details.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-se-4-october-production-report/\">iPhone SE 4 Production Will Reportedly Begin Ramping Up in October</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-production-will-reportedly-begin-ramping-up-in-october.2432077/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"da382a35489ebff90593ad71891062b1e057d00bc0110ec843bfaad4b50181cf","category":"Apple"}
