{"title":"‘Goodbye to Apple’s Smart Keyboard Folio’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/24151209/ipad-pro-smart-keyboard-folio-review-discontinued","date":1715293828000,"content":"\n<p>Chris Welch, The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then there was the fact that the folio keyboard was so damn light.\nIt kept the iPad Pro <em>feeling</em> like an iPad in my bag. That has\nnever, ever been the case with a Magic Keyboard attached. When it\ngoes on, you’ve entered MacBook weight territory. I’m not saying\nthere’s any problem with that, but with the Smart Keyboard Folio,\nthere was something special about toting around such a powerful\ncombo that always stayed so airy on my back.</p>\n\n<p>At best, Apple is being somewhat stubborn in assuming that every\niPad Pro buyer wants the tablet to feel like a laptop (and be a\nsimilar weight to one) whenever a keyboard is attached, which is\nwhat the Magic Keyboard gets you. If you want to view it with\nmore pessimism, the company is intentionally doing away with what\nwas a compelling, more affordable accessory — one that was easy\nto take anywhere — in hopes that more people will cave and fork\nover $300 for the only first-party keyboard that’s available for\nthe new Pro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suspect if it had been more popular, Apple would have made new ones for the new iPads. But I know Welch is not alone in his affinity for it. The textile-covered keyboard was far from ideal for typing feel, but the whole point of the Smart Keyboard Folio was to be a “good enough” keyboard when you need it — and the nature of that sort of keyboard made it perfect for use in a kitchen, with wet or dirty fingers. It was a keyboard cover you could just leave on your iPad all the time — and the Magic Keyboard isn’t that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/09/welch-smart-keyboard-folio\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"880ae9728baa27a52f4446e68963232997412c88ac2bd4be6a5c912a70bf858a","category":"Tech"}
