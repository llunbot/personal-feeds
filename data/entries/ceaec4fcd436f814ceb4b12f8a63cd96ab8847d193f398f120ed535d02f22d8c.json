Create an entirely new image based on a description, suggested concepts, and even a person from your Photos library. You can easily adjust the style and make changes to match a Messages thread, your Freeform board, or a slide in Keynote.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how Apple describes Genmoji:<blockquote>Make a brand-new Genmoji right in the keyboard to match any conversation. Provide a description to see a preview, and adjust your description until it's perfect. You can even pick someone from your Photos library and create a Genmoji that looks like them.</blockquote>\r<br />\n<h3>ChatGPT Integration With Siri</h3>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg\" width=\"1825\" height=\"1027\" />\r<br />\nApple said that ChatGPT will be available through Siri <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/ios-18-chatgpt-later-this-year/\">before the end of the year</a>, so this integration will likely go live with iOS 18.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith user permission, Siri will be able to show ChatGPT answers directly in response to questions and other prompts. ChatGPT will also be an option for Apple's system-wide Writing Tools feature, allowing users to generate text and images. Apple said ChatGPT will be powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-4o model on its platforms.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone, iPad, and Mac users will be able to use ChatGPT for free, without creating an account, and ChatGPT Plus subscribers will be able to connect their accounts to access paid features on these devices. Apple said OpenAI will not store ChatGPT requests made from its devices, and  it said users' IP addresses will be obscured.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 18.4</h2>\r<br />\n<h3>Siri: Personal Context, On-Screen Awareness, and Deeper Per-App Controls</h3>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.png\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman on Thursday <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1834404457649766568\">reiterated</a> that Siri's ability to provide more personalized and contextual responses will not be available until March. He previously said that Siri's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/\">available as part of iOS 18.4</a>, which is expected to be released to the public in March.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Apple Intelligence in Even More Countries</h3>\r<br />\nApple said Apple Intelligence will gain support for additional languages — such as Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish — next year. This timeframe suggests these languages will be added in iOS 18.4. Another possibility is iOS 18.3, but that update is likely to be a minor one that is released shortly after the U.S. holiday season.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/apple-intelligence-features-timing/\">Apple Intelligence Features Expected to Roll Out in This Order Between iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-features-expected-to-roll-out-in-this-order-between-ios-18-1-and-ios-18-4.2436225/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ceaec4fcd436f814ceb4b12f8a63cd96ab8847d193f398f120ed535d02f22d8c","category":"Apple"}
