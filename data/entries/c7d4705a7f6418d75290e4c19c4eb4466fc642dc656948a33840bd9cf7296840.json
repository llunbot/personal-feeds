Today’s one of those days—Amazon is cutting the price of every model of AirPods it sells, from the older second-gen model to the high-end AirPods Max and even the wired EarPods:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHWDR12/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Pro (2nd-gen)</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHWDR12/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$200 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings: </strong>$49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2nd-gen AirPods Pro have the same design as their predecessor, but they’re all-new on the inside, with 2X better noise cancellation, longer battery life, and a new Adaptive Transparency mode that automatically blocks out harmful noises. You’ll also get all of the new features coming in iOS 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods (3rd-gen, Lightning case)</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$149 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings: </strong>$20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s 3rd-gen AirPods bring several upgrades over the 2nd-gen model, including personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, sweat and water resistance, adaptive EQ, and most importantly, longer battery life. They also have a slightly refined design with touch controls. <em>Note: This model has a wired charging case and needs to be plugged in with a Lightning cable to charge.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods (2nd-gen)</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$99 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings: </strong>$30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s older AirPods are missing several of the features found in the 3rd-gen model, but they’re still fantastic earbuds, especially when you can get them for under $100. You’ll get over 24 hours of listening, “Hey Siri” support, and simple touch and tap controls</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Max</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$450 (Space Gray); </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$480 (all other colors) at Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings: </strong>$99/$69</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earbuds aren’t for everyone, which is why Apple makes AirPods Max. Apple’s highest-end headphones have a striking design featuring magnetic ear cups and a soft mesh headband available in five colors. With an Apple-designed dynamic driver and the H1 chip, you’ll get incredible sound, noise cancelation, Spatial Audio, and 20 hours of battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0GB8CC/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">EarPods</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0GB8CC/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$17 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Savings: </strong>$12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, these aren’t actually AirPods, but if you don’t want wireless buds, Apple still makes its old-fashioned EarPods that made the iPod so famous. They’re simple yet functional, and at just $17 you don’t need to be paranoid if you lose them.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c7d4705a7f6418d75290e4c19c4eb4466fc642dc656948a33840bd9cf7296840","category":"Apple"}
