But to date, once you've bypassed those requirement checks, there have been few consequences to running Windows 11 on old hardware. Unsupported or not, Windows 11 would run on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-whether-your-pc-is-supported-or-not/\">pretty much any 64-bit PC that could boot Windows 10</a>—we've run it on PCs as old as a Windows XP-era Core 2 Duo desktop.</p>\n<p>That's apparently changing a bit in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/microsoft-starts-testing-windows-11-24h2-as-this-years-big-update-takes-shape/\">Windows 11's 24H2 update</a>, which Microsoft began testing earlier this month. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBobPony/status/1756771051634135277\">posts</a> from a user named Bob Pony on X, formerly Twitter, the latest Windows 11 builds refuse to boot on older processors that don't support a relatively obscure instruction called \"POPCNT.\" Short for \"population count,\" it's used for \"counting the number of bits in a machine word,\" according to <a href=\"https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2019/09/08/popcount/\">an explainer</a> by programmer Vaibhav Sagar.</p>\n<p>It's unclear why POPCNT has become the load-bearing CPU instruction for a whole bunch of Windows components, but it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBobPony/status/1756771051634135277/photo/1\">looks like</a> the Windows kernel, the system's USB and network drivers, and other core system files now require the instruction as of Windows 11 24H2.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002974#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002974&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9d92b879bdddc316c8f0898d31e179aae2106d905fb2631b05f6084edf4dd88f","category":"Tech"}
