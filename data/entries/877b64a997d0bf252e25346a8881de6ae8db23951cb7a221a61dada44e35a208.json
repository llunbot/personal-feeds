Here’s a sampling of what we have already done:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/scholarship/\"><strong>AWS AI &amp; ML Scholarship Program</strong></a> – This program has awarded $28 million in scholarships to approximately 6000 students.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/educators/\"><strong>Machine Learning University</strong></a> – MLU offers a free program helping community colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) teach data management, artificial intelligence, and machine learning concepts. The program is designed to address opportunity gaps by supporting students who are historically underserved and underrepresented in technology disciplines.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/\"><strong>Amazon Future Engineer</strong></a> – Since 2021, up to $46 million in scholarships has been awarded to 1150 students through this program. In the past year, more than 2.1 million students received over 17 million hours of STEM education, literacy, and career exploration courses through this and other Amazon philanthropic education programs in the United States. I was able to speak to one such session last year and it was an amazing experience:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/26/afe_jeff_2024_1.png\" width=\"892\" height=\"670\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-to-help-29-million-people-around-the-world-grow-their-tech-skills-with-free-cloud-computing-skills-training-by-2025\"><strong>Free Cloud Training</strong></a> – In late 2020 we set a goal of helping 29 million people grow their tech skills with free cloud computing training by 2025. We worked hard and met that target a year ahead of time!</p> \n<p><span><strong>There’s More To Do</strong></span><br /> Despite all of this work and progress, there’s still more to be done. The future is definitely not evenly distributed: over half a billion students cannot be reached by digital learning today.</p> \n<p>We believe that Generative AI can amplify the good work that socially-minded edtech organizations, non-profits, and governments are already doing. Our goal is to empower them to build new and innovative digital learning systems that can amplify their work and allow them to reach a bigger audience.</p> \n<p>With the launch of the AWS Education Equity Initiative, we want to help pave the way for the next generation of technology pioneers as they build powerful tools, train foundation models at scale, and create AI-powered teaching assistants.</p> \n<p>We are committing up to $100 million in cloud technology and comprehensive technical advising over the next five years. The awardees will have access to the portfolio of AWS services and technical expertise so that they can build and scale learning management systems, mobile apps, chatbots, and other digital learning tools. As part of the application process, applicants will be asked to demonstrate how their proposed solution will benefit students from underserved and underrepresented communities.</p> \n<p>As I mentioned earlier, our partners are already doing a lot of great work in this area. For example:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://code.org/\"><strong> Code.org</strong></a> has already used AWS to scale their free computer science curriculum to millions of students in more than 100 countries. With this initiative, they will expand their use of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> to provide an automated assessment of student projects, freeing up educator time that can be use for individual instruction and tailored learning.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://rocketlearning.org/\"><strong>Rocket Learning</strong></a> focuses on early childhood education in India. They will use Amazon Q in QuickSight to enhance learning outcomes for more than three million children.</p> \n<p>I’m super excited about this initiative and look forward to seeing how it will help to create and educate the next generation of technology pioneers!</p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>","author":"Jeff Barr","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"877b64a997d0bf252e25346a8881de6ae8db23951cb7a221a61dada44e35a208","category":"Tech"}
