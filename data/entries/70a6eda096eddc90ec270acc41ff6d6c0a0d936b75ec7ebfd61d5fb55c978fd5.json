This third generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">power meter</a> builds on the functionality offered by its previous generation Precision Pro meter, but as with its single-sided Precision 3+ power meter, launched last year, it now incorporates Apple Find My tech. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s available pre-installed on Shimano Ultegra and Dura-Ace cranksets, priced from £949.99. 4iiii also offers factory installation on your own crankset, priced at £529.99, with a range of other Shimano road, gravel and MTB options to follow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Precision 3+ Pro will also come pre-installed on the Specialized <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Tarmac

of Apple Find My means that Apple technology users can now keep tabs on where their bike is when it’s out of sight (e.g. in the hands of airline baggage handlers) by activating the optional built-in Find My beacon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other functionality offered by the Precision 3+ Pro power meter ports over from its predecessors. That includes 4iiii’s 3D measurement, which 4iiii’s Director of Innovation &amp; Advanced Engineering, Mike Mercer, says gives you better metrics of your pedal stroke, with a claimed +/- 1 per cent accuracy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>4iiii fits three strain gauges in its power meters, which allows it to measure not just straight downwards force on your cranks as you pedal, but also twisting force and the axial bend at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Mercer says that you need to capture all three to get an accurate view of power output and a more complete assessment of pedalling dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand has also increased the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-guide-cadence\" target=\"_blank\">cadence </a>range over which the power meter operates, so that it can accurately measure power output at anything between 30rpm and 170rpm. Claimed power output measurement range is between 0 and 4,000 watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Precision 3+ Pro power meter measures both left and right leg power, you can assess left/right balance as well as torque effectiveness and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pedal-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">pedalling smoothness</a> as you ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Long battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-PRO-2-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>4iiii</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another neat feature is the automatic terrain selection, which works out the terrain over which you’re riding and your cadence. The meter switches between using accelerometers and gyroscopes to assess power output. 4iiii says that the latter are more accurate on rougher terrain and at high cadence, but are significantly more power hungry, so switching helps to conserve battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems to have achieved this very effectively, as 4iiii claims battery life of up to 550 hours for the new power meter, which is powered by just two CR2032 coin cells, one in the left crank power meter pod, the other mounted on the right side crankset spider. The Precision 3+ power meter pairs up with your head unit using either BLE or ANT+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Find My is incorporated in the left side power meter only. 4iiii points out that the Find My beacon tech means that the electronics don’t go into a deep sleep. There’s the option to turn Apple Find My off if you do want to conserve battery life at the expense of being able to track your power meter (and hopefully your bike too) when it’s out of sight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like 4iiii’s other power meters, the new Precision 3+ Pro is very compact and lightweight with a claimed weight of just 29g for the dual-sided meter as against 8g for the single-sided Precision 3+. It’s IPx7 rated for waterproofing and 4iiii says that the new compact design will increase the range of bikes with which it is compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Installation options and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/4iiii-PRECISION-3-Powermeter-with-Apple-Find-My-V2-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>4iiii</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a range of prices for the pre-installed 4iiii Precision 3+ Pro power meter depending on the Shimano crankset that it’s attached to. At launch it will be offered pre-installed on Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 and Ultegra R8100 12-speed cranksets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with 4iiii’s other power meters, there’s also the option for a factory install on your own crankset, which allows you to add a power meter to cranks from SRAM, Cannondale and FSA, as well as a wider range of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-shimano-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano</a> groupsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>4iiii says that the bulk of its business comes from Shimano units though, which is why this is the only platform on which it offers its power meters pre-installed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its power meters also come pre-installed on bikes from a number of brands, including Specialized, Canyon and Orbea, with 4iiii saying that its OEM partnerships are set to grow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Precision 3+ Pro power meter though will be available at launch pre-installed exclusively on the Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8 and S-Works Aethos. Some lower spec Tarmac and Aethos models as well as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-roubaix-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Roubaix </a>will be delivered fitted with the single-sided Precision 3+ power meter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to buy the power meter to fit to your own bike, you can buy the Precision 3+ Pro preinstalled on a Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 crankset for £1,224.99 / $1,224.99 or Ultegra R8100 for £949.99 / $949.99 directly from 4iiii and from local retailers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A factory install for a dual-sided meter is priced at £529.99 / $529.99. 4iiii also offers a drive-side only factory install for $329.99. 4iiii says that it will extend its factory installs from 12-speed Dura-Ace and Ultegra to 11-speed models, as well as Shimano XT, XTR, GRX 1×11 and GRX 1×12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 4iiii Precision 3+ Pro sits alongside the left side-only Precision 3+ power meter, which was launched in 2023 and is priced from £334.99 / $334.99 pre-installed on a Shimano 105 crank or £329.99 / $329.99 for a factory install on your own left side crank. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is performed locally in the UK, the Netherlands and Spain rather than requiring shipment to 4iiii in Canada, a capability which 4iiii will be extending to the dual sided meter this spring. The addition of the extra 3+ tech is also available as a £34.99 / $29.99 upgrade to an existing Precision 3 power meter.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/4iiii-precision-3-plus-pro-power-meter\">New 4iiii Precision 3+ Pro dual-sided power meter weighs 29g and includes Apple Find My tech</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"70a6eda096eddc90ec270acc41ff6d6c0a0d936b75ec7ebfd61d5fb55c978fd5","category":"Cycling"}
