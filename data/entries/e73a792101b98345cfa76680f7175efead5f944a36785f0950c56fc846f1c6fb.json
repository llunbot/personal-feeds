Pu has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/iphone-15-pro-price-increase-rumor/\">previously suggested price increases</a> for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, but this is the first time he has singled out the Pro Max as costing more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu doesn't specify why, but apart from a larger battery and display, the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-15-pro-max-periscope-rumored-again/\">widely expected</a> to feature one major difference compared to the 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ – a periscope lens. Both Pro models will include telephoto lens technology as part of their three-camera array, but the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max is likely to exclusively feature a periscope lens that will enable 5x to 6x optical zoom, a notable improvement over the 3x zoom on the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nA periscope lens system generally uses a primary lens to capture a photo, with an angled mirror or prism reflecting the light 90 degrees toward a second lens that then sends it to the image sensor. The image sensor and secondary lens are positioned sideways inside the smartphone to extend focal length, and that takes up valuable surface area.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his latest note, Pu also said he expects the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> series to enter mass production in August, which would be in line with previous years when Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup has been announced in September. Pu believes Apple will mass produce around 84 million units for the second half of 2023, with the two Pro models likely to be the most popular devices in the lineup in the first few months after launch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four ‌iPhone 15‌ models are rumored to feature a USB-C port, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, and a slightly more curved frame, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/01/iphone-15-pro-expected-features/\">12 additional features and changes</a> are rumored for the Pro models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/\">iPhone 15 Pro Max Predicted to Be More Expensive Than Previous Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-max-predicted-to-be-more-expensive-than-previous-model.2395190/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e73a792101b98345cfa76680f7175efead5f944a36785f0950c56fc846f1c6fb","category":"Apple"}
