These were to be new spacesuits that would allow astronauts to both perform spacewalks outside the International Space Station as well as walk on the Moon as part of the Artemis program.</p>\n<p>Now, that plan appears to be in trouble, with one of the spacesuit providers—Collins Aerospace—expected to back out, Ars has learned. It's a blow for NASA, because the space agency really needs modern spacesuits.</p>\n<p>NASA's Apollo-era suits have long been retired. The current suits used for spacewalks in low-Earth orbit are four decades old. \"These new capabilities will allow us to continue on the ISS and allows us to do the Artemis program and continue on to Mars,\" said the director of Johnson Space Center, Vanessa Wyche, during a celebratory news conference in Houston <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/nasa-announces-a-new-plan-to-buy-private-spacesuits-to-make-lunar-landing-date/\">two years ago</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033392#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e1c5f95c8b1f29bfcc1eeec725382a5dd7c4801e2a6157ae803b348bcb90ee4","category":"Tech"}
