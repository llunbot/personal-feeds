In addition, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-iphone-15-pro-iphone-13/\">discontinued the iPhone 13</a> this week, and that device has a Lightning port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/lightning-connector-feature-purple.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe list of Apple devices and accessories that are still sold with the 12-year-old Lightning port or connector continues to shrink, and it is now as follows:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE</li>\r<br />\n<li>Magic Keyboard (Mac)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Magic Mouse</li>\r<br />\n<li>Magic Trackpad\r<br />\n</li><li>First-generation Apple Pencil</li></ul>A new iPhone SE with a USB-C port is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/05/when-to-expect-iphone-se-4/\">rumored to launch next year</a>, while the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus should be discontinued next September.
