He sponsored DF to share his story of how listening to podcasts has largely replaced Wikipedia as an informal learning resource for him, personally. </p>\n\n<p>Fang has used Listen Notes to help himself listen to about 5,000 podcast episodes in the past 4 years. (!) In his blog post, he explains his own idiosyncratic methods for podcast discovery and consumption.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to jumpstart your own podcast project, <a href=\"https://listennotes.com/api\">try the Listen Notes podcast API</a>, or if you want to find all podcast interviews of a person, just search for their name on <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/?s=df\">listennotes.com</a>. Just a website, really well done.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/18/listen-notes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2ee50f93a613c985cb8d8270151d3fabd8eff5c2279d1fa48614a1e58b1b5735","category":"Tech"}
