With just 110mm rear travel and a 130mm fork, the geometry is an interesting mix aimed keeping it spritely in no matter which way the trail is headed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 29er Yowie has been put through its paces under Eric Porter in the Utah mountains, logging about 1,000 hours of ride time on it with another tester getting about 1,000 more up in the Pacific Northwest. Which is partly why it’s taken so long for the Yowie to come out, but the idea was born from Eric’s time spent coaching his kids’ NICA league.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of kids (because, you know, it’s Utah’s Wasatch Crest area) had longer travel bikes designed for the amazing lift-served trails near Park City. Which is too much for XC racing, but it’s hard to commit to a pure XC race bike when so many big trails are literally out your back door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the Yowie was designed to have just enough travel to keep it fun and playful on many of them, but efficient enough for racing, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of diamondback yowie short travel mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-1.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps that XC racing itself has gotten more aggressive, with “downcountry” almost becoming the new “cross country”, and riders looking for bikes that can tackle big rock gardens and mountain resorts. So, the Yowie’s 130mm fork paired with a 110mm rear end makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of diamondback yowie short travel mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-3.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a 29er, so it rolls fast for XC and epic marathon rides, with a 67º head angle sitting squarely at the XC end of the spectrum, and a steeper 75º seat angle and 435mm chainstays put the rider in a good pedaling position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of diamondback yowie short travel mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-4.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their Level Link suspension keeps the lower link in line with the chain throughout its travel, and the upper link is parallel to that at the sag point, keeping it supple over the small stuff while minimizing the impact of pedaling forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of diamondback yowie short travel mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-diamondback-yowie-short-travel-mountain-bike-2.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll come in carbon and alloy models ranging from $3,100 to $5,550, shipping this summer.
