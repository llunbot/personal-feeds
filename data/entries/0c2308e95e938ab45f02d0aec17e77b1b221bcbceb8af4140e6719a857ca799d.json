{"title":"Twitter API Pricing Prompts WordPress to Drop Automated Twitter Posting","link":"https://jetpack.com/blog/the-end-of-twitter-auto-sharing/","date":1682977374000,"content":"\n<p>From the official blog of Jetpack, an official WordPress plugin from Automattic</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922\">Twitter decided</a>, on short notice, to dramatically change\nthe terms and pricing of the Twitter API. We have attempted to\nwork with Twitter in good faith to negotiate new terms, but we\nhave not been able to reach an agreement. As a result, the Twitter\nconnection on Jetpack Social will cease to work, and your blog\nposts will no longer be auto-shared to Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>You will still be able to share your posts to Twitter manually by\npasting the post link into the body of your tweet.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, you can still auto-share your posts to Tumblr,\nFacebook, and Linkedin. In the near future, we are adding the\nability to auto-share to Instagram and Mastodon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Twitter’s new API pricing is exorbitant, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-elon-musk-paid-enterprise-api-access-pricing\">starting at $42,000/month for 50 million tweets</a>. I get the feeling that there are a lot of “enterprise” Twitter API users whom Elon Musk believed would definitely pay these prices, who instead are saying “<em>We are definitely</em> not <em>paying these prices</em>.” Musk thinks Twitter is indispensable. Doesn’t seem like anyone else does.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/01/twitter-apis-wordpress\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0c2308e95e938ab45f02d0aec17e77b1b221bcbceb8af4140e6719a857ca799d","category":"Tech"}
