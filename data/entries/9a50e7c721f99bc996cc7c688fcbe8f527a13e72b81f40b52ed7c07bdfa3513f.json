Not all butts are made the same, and an ill-fitting saddle can lead to some serious discomfort. That being said, the choices of saddles that female cyclists have had to pick from, have historically been limited compared to men’s or unisex models. This is especially true for those who push the limits and ride/race all out.

It also has a lifted rear profile and a 32mm wide cut-out.
