The project aims to reduce the psychological burden on operators suffering from harassment and has been in development for three years. Softbank plans to launch it by March 2026, but the idea is receiving mixed reactions online.</p>\n\n<p>According to a report from the Japanese news site <a href=\"https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15300914\">The Asahi Shimbun</a>, SoftBank's project relies on an AI model to alter the tone and pitch of a customer's voice in real-time during a phone call. SoftBank's developers, led by employee Toshiyuki Nakatani, trained the system using a dataset of over 10,000 voice samples, which were performed by 10 Japanese actors expressing more than 100 phrases with various emotions, including yelling and accusatory tones.</p>\n<p>Voice cloning and synthesis technology has made massive strides in the past three years. We've previously covered <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/\">technology from Microsoft</a> that can clone a voice with a three-second audio sample and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/make-a-bathroom-sound-like-a-pro-audio-booth-with-adobes-free-ai-tool/\">audio-processing technology</a> from Adobe that cleans up audio by re-synthesizing a person's voice, so SoftBank's technology is well within the realm of plausibility.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032137#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032137&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6951f1c1f99514ab51d0cb417a4ec88eb7f0a2357be5121eab0cb1569b59c314","category":"Tech"}
