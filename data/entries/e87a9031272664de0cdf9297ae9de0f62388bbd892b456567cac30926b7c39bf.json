Another was a 69-year-old woman who was hospitalized for liver failure after drinking the water for years. She died in the hospital on November 11, 2020.</p>\n<p>They are among around a hundred people who say they have suffered acute liver toxicity and failure from the water and have filed lawsuits against Real Water, according to attorney Will Kemp. In an interview Friday, Kemp told Ars he represents a little over 60 of the plaintiffs, including the seven in the case that received a jury verdict this week. It was the first case to go to trial.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974240#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974240&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e87a9031272664de0cdf9297ae9de0f62388bbd892b456567cac30926b7c39bf","category":"Tech"}
