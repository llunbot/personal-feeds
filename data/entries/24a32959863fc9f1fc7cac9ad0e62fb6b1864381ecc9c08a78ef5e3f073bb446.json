I got a chance to go through their fitting process at their booth at the 2023 <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/Sea-Otter-Classic\" target=\"_blank\">Sea Otter Classic</a>.</p>\n<p>Kav invited me to check out their updated helmet called the Kav Portola: Kaze as well as their new range of 3D-printed color options. I also went through the sizing process where they took a range of measurements for what will ultimately become a helmet custom-made for my head.</p>\n<p>Their Color Exploration Program is expected to launch later this year. Stay tuned for a full review of the Portola: Kaze helmet, which the brand says offers better ventilation, adjustable straps, and a new sweat management system <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2022/06/kav-sports-portola-helmet-review/\" target=\"_blank\">James Huang recommended in our review of the Kav Portola helmet</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kav-Kazehelmet_colorways-2.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Kav-Kazehelmet_colorways-2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kav-Kazehelmet_colorways-2.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kav-Kazehelmet_colorways-2.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Walk to Kav’s booth at the Sea Otter Classic and you’re greeted by the company’s new color customization program.

I’ll be able to put that to the test in the hot and humid central Texas summer once I get one in.

And while it doesn’t look as inviting as a set of pads in a standard helmet, the Portola Kaze felt very comfortable, even if the one I tried wasn’t custom-designed for my head. <span>(Photo: Alvin Holbrook/CyclingTips)</span></figcaption></figure></figure>\n<figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kavhelmet_3dprintdetail.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Kav Portola Kaze helmet detail. \" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kavhelmet_3dprintdetail.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kavhelmet_3dprintdetail.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Kav’s helmets use a honeycomb-like structure that the brand says absorbs energy in an impact. The concept isn’t dissimilar to Smith’s Koroyd usage or Lazer’s Kineticore designs that eschew an independent slip plane like MIPS for sheer material deformation. <span>(Photo: Alvin Holbrook/CyclingTips)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kavhelmet_back-side-angle.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Kavhelmet_back-side-angle\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kavhelmet_back-side-angle.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kavhelmet_back-side-angle.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>Layer lines that are more or less an inevitable part of the printing process because of the sheer number of layers necessary to build a vast majority of 3D-printed products.

Measurements taken included head circumference, length, width, brow width, and a few others.
