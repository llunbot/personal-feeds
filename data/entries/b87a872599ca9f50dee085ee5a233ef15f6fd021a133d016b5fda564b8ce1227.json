{"title":"First iPhone 16e Benchmark Reveals Impact of Reduced GPU Core Count","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-geekbench-binned-a18-chip/","date":1740135108000,"content":"The first Geekbench score for Apple's new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> has surfaced, revealing the performance impact of Apple's decision to use a binned version of the A18 chip with fewer GPU cores compared to the standard iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAccording to Geekbench 6 Metal benchmark results spotted by <em><a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/iphone-16e-geekbench-8gb-ram/\">MySmartPrice</a></em>, the iPhone 16e scored 24,188 points in graphics testing, which is around 15% lower than the more expensive iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. This performance difference is likely due to Apple's use of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">chip-binned A18 chip</a>. Chip binning is a common industry practice where chips with disabled or non-functional components are repurposed for lower-tier products. This approach helps manufacturers maximize yield and reduce waste while offering products at different price points.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn this case, the A18 chip in the iPhone 16e features a 4-core GPU configuration, compared to the 5-core GPU found in the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. However, as the Geekbench test shows, the 6-core CPU count remains unchanged.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite the reduced GPU performance, the iPhone 16e is expected to maintain strong overall performance, especially for its $599 starting price point. The Geekbench test also corroborates our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-has-8gb-of-ram/\">previous finding</a> that the iPhone 16e has 8GB of RAM, which is a minimum requirement of Apple Intelligence. The device tested was running iOS 18.3.1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Geekbench-gpu-benchmark.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"849\" />\r<br />\nOf course, further benchmark results and real-world testing will be needed to fully assess the impact of the reduced GPU core count on everyday tasks and gaming performance. Apple will be accepting pre-orders for the iPhone 16e starting today at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and the device launches on Friday, February 28 in 59 countries and regions.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mysmartprice-com/\">MySmartPrice</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-geekbench-binned-a18-chip/\">First iPhone 16e Benchmark Reveals Impact of Reduced GPU Core Count</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-iphone-16e-benchmark-reveals-impact-of-reduced-gpu-core-count.2449864/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b87a872599ca9f50dee085ee5a233ef15f6fd021a133d016b5fda564b8ce1227","category":"Apple"}
