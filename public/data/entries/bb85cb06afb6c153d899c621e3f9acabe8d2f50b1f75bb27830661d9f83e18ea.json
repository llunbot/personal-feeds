(credit: Andrew Cunningham)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Arguably one of the best business laptops on the market, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/review-latest-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-is-a-good-performer-with-iffy-battery-life/\">Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10</a> is now discounted by 50 percent. The Gen 10 version of Lenovo's laptop retains the slim and ultraportable laptop design of prior generations but comes with Intel's 12th Gen mobile Core processors. One downside is the battery. While the Gen 10 model delivers meaningful performance improvements with Intel's silicon, it is hampered by a significant reduction in battery life compared to the prior Gen 9 model, as we noted in our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/review-latest-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-is-a-good-performer-with-iffy-battery-life/3/\">review</a>.</p>\n<p>The ThinkPad also offers durability boosts like a spill-resistant keyboard, MIL-SPEC 810H certification, and upgradeable and repairable internal components.
