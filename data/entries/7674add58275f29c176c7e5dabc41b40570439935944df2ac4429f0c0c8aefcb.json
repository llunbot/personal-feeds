While that is true, there are still many brands focused on creating quality machines that are still attainable. Brands like State Bicycle Co.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need proof? Check out the new 2025 Carbon All-Road. There have been some significant upgrades in versatility, performance, and design, all while keeping the price impressively low. The new 2025 Carbon All-Road looks ready to set a new precedent in the gravel/adventure space while keeping State Bicycle’s high-value ethos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic.webp\" alt=\"2025 State Carbon All-Road first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-first-pic-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / State Bicycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>State says that the new Carbon All-Road has improved in every aspect when compared to the OG, and that it’s faster, more capable, and more fun to ride. The new one includes UDH compatibility, T47 bottom bracket, and clearance for 700 x 2.2″ tires. It sports integrated frame storage and completely redesigned geometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot.webp\" alt=\"2025 State Carbon All-Road lean dusty merlot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-lean-dusty-merlot-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s chock-full of component upgrades, with wider gearing, wider rims, and much better brakes. It looks to have the same spec upgrades as the 4130 All-Road that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-state-bicycles-affordable-updated-4130-all-road-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">I reviewed</a> a little while ago. Also, All State complete, geared bikes come with the ability to upgrade to SRAM and ENVE build kits, again at impressive prices. The new Carbon All-Road comes in two colors, Dusty Merlot, and White.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get into the weeds…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Frame Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage.webp\" alt=\"2025 State Carbon All-Road frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-State-Carbon-All-Road-frame-storage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of great features that have been added to the All Road, but the most interesting may be the Downtube Storage Box. Not only is there integrated storage now, but the design integrates a Fidlock magnetic closure system. We haven’t tried it out ourselves, but the idea of an easy to open/close door with a magnetic latch sounds pretty appealing. The only question mark is with the latch located above the water bottle cage mount, would you be able to access it easily with a bottle in the cage?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Universal Derailleur Hanger (UDH) Compatibility</strong>: <em>Ready for the latest drivetrain standards, ensuring easy maintenance and upgradeability.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>“Best of Both Worlds” Internally Routed Cables</strong>:<em> A cleaner aesthetic with better protection from the elements, yet still allowing for easy accessibility with an externally routed cockpit. </em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Downtube Storage Box</strong>: <em>This feature utilizes a Fidlock magnetic closure system. The bike includes neoprene storage cases for an inner tube and other ride essentials.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tire Clearance: </strong>700c x 2.2” or 650b x 2.4” </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Front Derailleur Delete with Aero Plate</strong>: <em>A sleek molded cover provides a clean, aerodynamic look when using a 1x drivetrain, eliminating clutter and reducing weight.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More Mounting Points</strong>: <em>Additional mounts on the underside of the downtube, top tube, and fork provide even more storage and adventure potential. </em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Race Geometry</strong>: <em>A shorter head tube and aggressive geometry make this bike lightning-fast while stable enough for endurance adventures</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>T47 Bottom Bracket</strong>: <em>This oversized threaded bottom bracket provides increased stiffness for improved power transfer and pedaling efficiency. The threaded design makes maintenance easier and eliminates creaking issues common in press-fit bottom brackets.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Carbon All-Road Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
