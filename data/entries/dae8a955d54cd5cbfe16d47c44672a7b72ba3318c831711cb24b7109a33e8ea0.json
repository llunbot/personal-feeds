They\nare not saying you are <em>allowed</em> to get vaccinated, they are\nsaying you <em>should</em> get vaccinated. Indeed, that’s not just their\nmedical advice to you — it’s their stated belief (and I agree)\nthat getting vaccinated is a pro-social means of safeguarding your\nentire community.</p>\n\n<p>So I am saying, with a full understanding of the process, that the\nFDA ought to bring the official regulatory status of mRNA Covid\nvaccines into line with the scientific community’s actual\nunderstanding and attitude toward the vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>The government is not worried that Pfizer and Moderna might be\nrunning a scam on us. They are charging $20 a dose, not\n$56,000. We are begging people to take these shots. So we\nshould act like it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>FDA formal approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines isn’t the entirety of his argument, but it comes first because it’s so obvious. And the next steps — mandating the vaccines in places like schools and the military — require FDA formal approval.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/21/yglesias-vaccination-approval\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dae8a955d54cd5cbfe16d47c44672a7b72ba3318c831711cb24b7109a33e8ea0","category":"Tech"}
