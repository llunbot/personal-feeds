Tumbleweed chose this platform because the crank design is great for touring since preload is easily adjustable, and you can remove the cranks with just an Allen wrench and a small plastic preload cap tool, and the 24mm steel spindle is strong and stiff.</p>\n<p>The Tumbleweed Wagon Wheel Chainring is available in both stainless ($110) or black alloy ($85) and in 32t sizing only right now.</p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://tumbleweed.cc/collections/products/products/wagon-wheel-chainring\" target=\"_blank\">Tumbleweed Bicycle Co</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tumbleweed-wagon-wheel-chainring/\">Tumbleweed Bicycle Co Wagon Wheel Chainring Comes in Stainless and Alloy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"4005c56cdd61ce24b6eee4c9a3efbbbec8c1b1af9ac276e478fd042eb1d66523","category":"Cycling"}
