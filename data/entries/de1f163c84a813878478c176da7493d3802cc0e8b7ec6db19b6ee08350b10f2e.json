While I’m working on a column regarding yesterday’s event, Dithering subscribers already have my short take, with an episode Ben Thompson and I recorded this morning. One spoiler: I think we ought to cut Apple some slack on that “Mother Nature” sketch.</p>\n\n<p>Dithering as a standalone subscription costs just $5/month or $50/year. You get two episodes per week, each exactly 15 minutes long. I just love having an outlet like Dithering for weeks like this one. People who try Dithering seem to love it, too — we have remarkably little churn.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/13/dithering\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"de1f163c84a813878478c176da7493d3802cc0e8b7ec6db19b6ee08350b10f2e","category":"Tech"}
