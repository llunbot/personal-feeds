It allows websites and web apps to be organized into different workspaces or projects, and it supports multitasking with two active pages at one time. Workspaces that you don't need can be snoozed temporarily, and for those who often collaborate, you can send pages directly to another user's browser. SigmaOS is free to try, but it costs $10 per month for unlimited workspaces, pages, actions, and cross-device syncing.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minikey/id1582566969\">MiniKey</a></strong> ($1.99) - MiniKey is a lightweight one-time password app for the Mac that's designed as an alternative to apps like Authy or Google Authenticator. It lives in the Mac's menu bar and can be used to store all of your two-factor authentication codes. You can click to copy or drag and drop from the drop down menu where your authentication codes are stored.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-drawing-app/id1581223559?mt=12\">Magic Drawing App</a></strong> (Free) - Magic is designed to let you create drawings with your Mac's trackpad. It has pressure sensitivity when used with a MacBook's Force Touch trackpad, and there are customizable brushes to choose from.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://replay.software/sleeve\">Sleeve</a></strong> ($5) - Sleeve is a desktop music player that works with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, Spotify, and Doppler. It's deeply customizable and lets you create a little desktop music widget that lets you know what's playing, provides album art, and offers up playback controls. You can decide just how much information you want to see and where you want it.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://slapdash.com\">Slapdash</a></strong> (Free) - Slapdash aggregates the capabilities from all of your apps into one easy access spot that can be reached with a single keyboard command (command + J). You just open up Slapdash and search for what you want if it's not already in the quick access list. Slapdash is customizable and there are team features for companies. Slapdash is free for limited use, but unlocking all of the features requires a $12/month subscription.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nKnow of a must-have Mac app or game that we haven't highlighted yet?
