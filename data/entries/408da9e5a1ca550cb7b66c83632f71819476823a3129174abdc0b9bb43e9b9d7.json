The press gushed about it: “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/hollywood-star-tech-execs-invest-italian-start-up-bending-spoons-2022-09-27/\">Hollywood star, tech execs \ninvest in Italian start-up Bending Spoons</a>”, “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/09/27/ryan-reynolds-gabrielle-union-bending-spoons-340-million-fundraise-kerry-trainor-keisuke-honda/\">Ryan Reynolds \ninvests in ‘terrifying’ Italian start-up Bending</a>”. And Ryan \nhimself said things that are just so easy to imagine him saying (a \ntestament to the spectacular job he’s done branding himself): \n“Their apps enable anyone to become a creative genius with minimum \neffort. In fact, their products terrify me so much, I had to \ninvest.” (Ironically - or not? - his ad agency is called <a href=\"https://www.maximumeffort.com/\">Maximum \nEffort</a>…) </p>\n\n<p>The problem? Bending Spoons is the one the most predatory actors \non the entire App Store - they’re terrifying in a completely \ndifferent way. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bending Spoons’s business model is to buy successful apps, change them to a <em>weekly</em> auto-renewing subscription model that perhaps tricks users into signing up, and using the revenue to buy more apps and repeat the cycle. Filmic, for example, now defaults to a $3/week subscription — over $150/year. To be fair, there’s also a $40/year subscription.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t seem like a scam, per se, but it doesn’t seem like a product-driven company. Apps seemingly don’t thrive after acquisition by Bending Spoons — instead, they get bled dry. There are some apps where a weekly subscription makes sense — <a href=\"https://www.flightyapp.com/\">Flighty</a> comes to mind, for occasional travelers — but a camera app? Feels deceptive.</p>\n\n<p>Bending Spoons is a big company with a lot of revenue and that spends a <em>lot</em> of money on App Store and Play Store search ads.
