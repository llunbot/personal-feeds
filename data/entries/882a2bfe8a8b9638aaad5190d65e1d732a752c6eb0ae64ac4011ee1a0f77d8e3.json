Now, LeBron is taking his relationship with Canyon further, and acting as the face of a new joint initiative. The goal of the partnership is to “inspire millions of potential cyclists across the globe to understand just how life-changing a bike can be.” Canyon and LeBron have released a <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-us/lebron-james/#video\" target=\"_blank\">cycling advocacy collaboration</a> that draws on Le Bron’s inspiring personal story, embracing the freedom of cycling and inspiring others to discover the boundless joy a bike can deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inspiring a New Generation of Riders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon is amplifying its ambition to be the world’s most inspiring and innovative bike brand by partnering with global icon LeBron James. Together, they aim to unleash the unlimited potential of bicycles to help inspire and change people’s lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all starts with a video clip and is followed by a bike donation to the LeBron James Family Foundation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>LeBron’s Inspiration to Ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>LeBron James has always credited the role that bikes played in helping him become one of the most recognized athletes in the world. LeBron started his journey with the bicycle when he was a small child in Akron, Ohio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, he remains an advocate of bicycles and the freedom, mobility, and accessibility they provide. He’s spoken out about the power the bike has to overcome barriers – whether they are social or geographic restrictions – and how bicycles still power him personally as part of an active, healthy lifestyle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-LeBron-on-steps.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"868\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-LeBron-on-steps.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon and LeBron Collab LeBron on steps\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-LeBron-on-steps.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-LeBron-on-steps-297x201.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-LeBron-on-steps-120x81.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-LeBron-on-steps-768x521.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Canyon)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Riding a bike has always been a big part of my life. When I was growing up, it was how I got around – from riding with friends across the city to getting to practice and wherever I needed to be. It gave me the freedom to not only get to places but to access things that otherwise would have been out of reach. Even now, riding a bike makes me feel like a kid again. There’s nothing like feeling the air on your face and that freedom to just ride</em>.” – LeBron James</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon and LeBron Collab Fabio Wibmer in action\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-Fabio-Wibmer-in-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Fabio Wilbmer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding a bike can bring inspiration, freedom, and joy, and also unleash the will to perform – these are values that Canyon and LeBron both believe in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon and LeBron Collab OLIVIA SILVA\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-and-LeBron-Collab-OLIVIA-SILVA-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Olivia Silva</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>We believe in the transformational power of bikes.
