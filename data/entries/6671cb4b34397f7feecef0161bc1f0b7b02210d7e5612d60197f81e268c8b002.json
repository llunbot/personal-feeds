At what other moment in modern times\nhas a single man wielded so much unaccountable power over such a\nlarge swath of the world economy? There are whole businesses\ndevoted to risk analysis for corporations; this is a situation in\nwhich Trump himself is the risk and the crisis being analyzed is\none that he created. Talk about an ego trip.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Glasser links to <a href=\"https://x.com/Kasparov63/status/1907798003236188169\">Garry Kasparov, on X</a>, responding to Wall Street’s collective surprise that Trump did what he’s been saying he would do re: tariff policy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As I’ve said for years about Putin, and which applies to other\nautocratic personalities like Trump: “Dictators always lie about\nwhat they’ve done, but are often quite plain about what they want\nto do.” “Trump would never...” is the new “Putin would never...”</p>\n\n<p>Such people do and take whatever they can, unless they are\nstopped. That they don’t always succeed does not mean they were\nnot sincere in their ambitions and won’t keep trying to fulfill\nthem. Trump has only been emboldened by the sycophantic GOP this\ntime around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even more apt, “Deep Throat” explaining the central truth of the Watergate scandal to Bob Woodward in the Alan-Pakula-directed / William-Goldman-written film adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/891-all-the-president-s-men?language=en-US\">All the President’s Men</a></em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Forget the myths the media has created about the White House.\nThe truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out\nof hand.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/glasser-trump-ego\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6671cb4b34397f7feecef0161bc1f0b7b02210d7e5612d60197f81e268c8b002","category":"Tech"}
