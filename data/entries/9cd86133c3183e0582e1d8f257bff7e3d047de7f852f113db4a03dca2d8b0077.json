Hunt shared emails from Twitter with the Huffington Post that confirmed that her election campaign ad's reach was restricted because Twitter's <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/ads-content-policies/healthcare.html\">ad policy</a> currently \"restricts promotion of health and pharmaceutical products and services,\" which includes ads for \"abortion clinics\" and \"abortion advocacy.\"</p>\n<p>“Ah yes, the mention of abortion advocacy is the issue here,” Twitter's employee reportedly told Hunt. However, the employee also noted that there may be “some good news to share on that front” in the next week or so.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948572#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948572&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9cd86133c3183e0582e1d8f257bff7e3d047de7f852f113db4a03dca2d8b0077","category":"Tech"}
