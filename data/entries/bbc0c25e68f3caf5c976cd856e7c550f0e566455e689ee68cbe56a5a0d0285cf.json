To the uninitated, the concept of a pro race that not only seeks out the worst possible surfaces you could think to ride a bike on, but claims dragging its participants across those awful surfaces actually makes the racing better, is a ludicrous idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-2.webp 1200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-2-300x168.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-2-970x542.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-2-768x429.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-2-750x419.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-2-1140x637.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet to us cycling fans, the cobbles of Belgium and northern France are a feature not a bug, a rite of passage that separates the legends of our sport from the mere participants. So we make no apologies that cobbles feature prominently in our May 2025 issue of <em>Cyclist</em> magazine, available on newsstands now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of this weekend’s Tour of Flanders, we go for a ride with Johan Museeuw – a man known as ‘The Lion of Flanders’ for his three Flanders wins and eight podium finishes and who runs a guesthouse near to the Oude Kwaremont, one of the mythical climbs that define the racing action each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-3.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-3.webp 1200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-3-970x545.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-3-768x431.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-3-750x421.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-3-1140x640.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that annual celebration of suffering known as Paris-Roubaix taking place a week later, our Big Ride this issue sees us travel to northern France, ride the last 100km of the Paris-Roubaix route – including most of the toughest cobbled secteurs – and return home all in a single day. None of the pros will be doing that next Sunday, that’s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"708\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-4.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-4.webp 1200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-4-300x177.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-4-970x572.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-4-768x453.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-4-750x443.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-4-1140x673.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a connection to the spring Classics in the latest of our Bike History series too as we shine a deserved light on the Pinarello Dogma, one of the most successful bikes in modern pro cycling history. Aside from a long list of Grand Tour successes, the Dogma was ridden to Paris-Roubaix victory by Ineos’s Dylan van Baarle in 2022 among numerous other one-day victories over the year. We discuss the history and heritage of the Dogma, and how it helped shape the performance end of the race bike market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"963\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-5.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-5.webp 1200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-5-300x241.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-5-970x778.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-5-768x616.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-5-750x602.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/new-issue-162-5-1140x915.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching gears, our May 2025 issue also takes us to Japan for an insight into one of the most particular cycling cultures on the planet.
