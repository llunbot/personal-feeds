Velvet Caviar has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> cases for all of Apple's modern devices, including the <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/iphone-13-cases\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/iphone-13-mini-cases\">iPhone 13 mini</a>, <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/iphone-13-pro-cases\">iPhone 13 Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/iphone-13-pro-max-cases\">iPhone 13 Pro Max</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/velvet-caviar-iphone-case.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nVelvet Caviar's ‌iPhone‌ cases are protective without adding too much bulk. There's a lip around the front of the display to keep it safe from drops and scratches, and a similar ridge around the camera cutout to protect it when the ‌iPhone‌ is on its back.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Velvet Caviar, all of its case options are designed from high-impact plastics that can withstand drops on hard surfaces, plus there are protective corners that protect the ‌iPhone‌'s most vulnerable parts. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> cases are designed to have a perfect fit, matching all the curves and cutouts of the device. Cases are priced between $25 and $35.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/velvet-caviar-iphone-case-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCase designs run the gamut at Velvet Caviar, and there's everything from a <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/iphone-13-pro-cases/products/holo-moonstone-marble-iphone-case?variant=39515900674094\">Holo Moonstone</a> case to a Galaxy Glitter case to several floral options. You'll find all kinds of patterns including marble, geode, tie dye, cloud, geometric, and more. Many of the non-clear cases are compatible with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> technology and can be used with Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ charger and other magnetic accessories.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/velvet-caviar-iphone-case-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTo match the ‌iPhone 13‌ cases, Velvet Caviar also makes cases designed for the <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/airpod-cases\">AirPods and the AirPods Pro</a> in many of the same patterns and designs. The two piece <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> cases are made from a durable hard plastic material and feature an attached carabiner to hang the ‌AirPods‌ from bags or on keys. ‌AirPods‌ cases are priced at $20.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/velvet-caviar-airpods-case.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Apple Watch owners, Velvet Caviar has a <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/apple-watch-bands\">range of bands</a> made from a vegan leather material, many of which also feature the same patterns available on the ‌iPhone‌ cases. There are also more muted and neutral color options, with Apple Watch bands priced at $30.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/velvet-caviar-apple-watch-band-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the <a href=\"https://velvetcaviar.com/collections/macbook-cases\">MacBook Air and MacBook Pro</a>, Velvet Caviar makes $45 cases made from a hard plastic material that keeps MacBooks safe from drops and scratches that might happen when on the go. The MacBook cases feature two protective shells, one for the top of the MacBook and one for the bottom.
