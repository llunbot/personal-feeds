{"title":"On the Ever-Increasing Accuracy of Weather Forecasts","link":"https://ourworldindata.org/weather-forecasts","date":1710899627000,"content":"\n<p>Hannah Ritchie, writing for Our World in Data:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It wasn’t until 1859 that the UK’s Meteorological Service (the Met \nOffice) <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/our-history\">issued its first</a> weather forecast for shipping. \nTwo years later, it broadcasted its first public weather forecast. \nWhile meteorological measurements improved over time, the massive \nstep-change in predictions came with the use of computerized \nnumerical modeling. This didn’t start until a century later, in \nthe 1960s. </p>\n\n<p>Forecasts have improved a lot since then. We can see this across a \nrange of measurements, and different national meteorological \norganizations. The Met Office <a href=\"https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2023/11/15/why-an-exact-date-weather-forecast-headline-isnt-what-it-seems/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20certainty%20suggested%20in,come%20with%20in%2Dbuilt%20uncertainty.\">says</a> its four-day forecasts \nare now as accurate as its one-day forecasts were 30 years ago. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I was a kid it was a running gag that weathermen were always wrong. I can’t remember the last time I heard anyone joke about weather forecasts being useless. Over the last 40 years, 7-day forecasts have gone from a coin toss to “highly accurate”.
