This week, Stellantis—which owns Dodge, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and others—announced that it will adopt the new SAE J3400 charging standard for its battery electric vehicles beginning in 2025.</p>\n<p>As a result, all the major automakers that sell BEVs in North America have made the switch to J3400, a process that began last May <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/ford-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/\">when Ford revealed</a> it was ditching the Combined Charging Standard 1 (CCS1) socket for what was then called the North American Charging Standard (NACS).</p>\n<p>In fact, the technical changes between the two are mild—NACS, now known as J3400, uses the same electronic communication protocols as CCS1. The real draw for Ford, and for each automaker who announced the switch since, has been negotiated access for their customers to Tesla's Supercharger network, which far outstrips the CCS1 infrastructure in the US and Canada.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002957#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002957&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
