As the kids would say, they just hit different. For the riders, the Classics season starts at the end of February with Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, but for seasoned Italian photographers Francesco Rachello and Eloise Mavian, who work together as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tornanti_cc/?hl=en-gb\" target=\"_blank\">Tornanti.cc</a>, it begins even earlier with arranging press accreditation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘With accreditation you can move more freely during the race and get to the finish line and the podium,’ says Mavian. But even with the magic pass, getting access to the race isn’t always easy in the face of officialdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sometimes you still have problems,’ adds Rachello. ‘You might find a policeman at an entry point who just says, “Sorry, no, you’re not coming through.”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mavian, officials’ lack of knowledge can be frustrating: ‘It’s often the police saying that our position is not safe, but as someone who understands bike racing, you know that the riders won’t be anywhere near a certain part of a turning, for example.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once they have talked their way past the uniforms, there is still the issue of how to keep up with a flying peloton while negotiating a course through crowds and past roadblocks. ‘Google Street View is our friend,’ says Rachello. ‘You can check the shortcuts between different spots and see if they match up. Alas, that doesn’t always go to plan and sometimes we just get stuck in race traffic.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Other photographers don’t always do a lot of preparation, and then you see them following us on the day,’ adds Mavian. But following other photographers isn’t always the best plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘At Liège, we were taking a shortcut close to the finish. We saw some other experienced photographers turn down this road that was insanely muddy, and we followed them. And it got muddier. And muddier. And then it turned up a steep hill. Eventually we had to turn around, by which point we’d missed a key part of the race. Lesson learned.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Careful route planning and positioning is also key to getting those shots that are maybe missed by the bulk of photographers covering the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We try to not always take the same photos,’ says Mavian. ‘There are certain shots you need to take every year – pelotons squeezing up cobbled alleys, those kinds of things – but sometimes you go for the risky shots. Maybe from inside a barn or something in low light, where you’ve got to gamble. These can go badly, but the payoff is bigger when they go well. Lots can go wrong: the lighting, timing, people wandering into shot, even losing track of time and missing the front of the race go by. It does happen.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/valentin-madouas-interview-2024\">Valentin Madouas Q&amp;A: ‘The one major objective for my career is to win a stage at the Tour de France’</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Giro d’Italia 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-femenina-2024-gallery\">The best photos from La Vuelta Femenina 2024: The empire strikes back</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/spring-classics-highlights-2024\">The 8 best moments from the spring Classics 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-photographer\">Ready, aim, shoot!

And later on we will be editing until near midnight.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there is the Classics weather to contend with. ‘Sometimes the moto is a brutal experience,’ says Mavian. ‘I had to do an hour to get to Bastogne on the highway and it was absolutely freezing and wet. Zero degrees. I’ve never been so happy to get to the safety meeting. I had a boiling coffee and brought myself back to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Flèche Wallonne was equally savage. For the whole first half I couldn’t feel my hands. It was agony to take the photos. My moto driver heated my gloves on the engine, which saved me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fight to get pictures while staving off frostbite, essential tasks like eating can easily get kicked down the list of priorities. ‘You’ve got to eat when you can,’ says Rachello. ‘At Paris-Roubaix you do the start and then there’s a good bar next to the first cobbled sector where all the photographers congregate. You can have some BBQ food and they play good music. It really kicks off.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But lunch is usually a snack scoffed in a gaps between taking pictures and chasing the pack. ‘You just don’t get time,’ says Mavian. ‘I pack a few bars but often they don’t get eaten. I need a sticker on my top tube to remind me to eat, like the riders.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I don’t eat meat but once I had to make an exception as I was so cold,’ says Rachello. ‘I’d been starving on the moto and eventually had a sausage because there were literally no alternatives. Then on Strade Bianche I swallowed so much dust that I was sick in bed for a few days. That wasn’t fun.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, they are not there for fun. As Rachello points out, the hardships of shooting the Classics are balanced by the privilege of being at the centre of something special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The emotion you feel when you enter the cobbled sections is like nothing else,’ he says. ‘It just explodes – it’s intoxicating. There is nothing quite like it.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Main image at the top: </strong>‘This is the first cobbled sector of Paris-Roubaix.
