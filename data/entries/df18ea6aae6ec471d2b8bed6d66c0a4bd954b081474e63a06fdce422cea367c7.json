Rumors claim Apple is gearing up to launch a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2518726/apples-next-big-thing-may-be-a-smart-ipad-you-can-hang-on-your-wall.html\">iPad-like home controller</a> in 2025 as well as smart home-centric updates to the HomePod mini and Apple TV. And now there’s a new rumored product on the way: a smart video doorbell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-22/apple-explores-amazon-ring-doorbell-competitor-with-face-id-airpods-heart-rate?embedded-checkout=true\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a>, writing in its latest Power On newsletter, Apple has “nother home device in the works that hasn’t been reported before: a smart doorbell with advanced facial recognition that wirelessly connects to a deadbolt lock.” He explains that the doorbell would automatically unlock by scanning a user’s face, just like an iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video doorbells aren’t exactly new or innovative, but one with facial recognition most certainly is. The technology isn’t without its security issues—aside from spoofing the system an intruder could gain entry by forcing a face scan against a user’s will—but Apple has plenty of time to work out solutions. Gurman says the accessory is “still in the early stages” and won’t ship “before the end of next year at the soonest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video doorbell market is dominated by Amazon Ring, and there are only a handful of doorbells that support HomeKit, including the popular <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/2318531/aqara-smart-video-doorbell-g4-review-truly-subscription-free.html\">Aqara G4 Doorbell</a>. Apple offers <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1388132/how-to-export-video-homekit-secure-video-camera.html\">HomeKit Secure Video</a> for HomeKit-compatible video doorbells that brings end-to-end encryption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also rumored to be making an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2518637/apple-may-be-gearing-up-to-launch-its-first-smart-home-camera.html\">indoor/outdoor security camer</a>a as it seeks to build out an array of accessories that tap into HomeKit and Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"df18ea6aae6ec471d2b8bed6d66c0a4bd954b081474e63a06fdce422cea367c7","category":"Apple"}
