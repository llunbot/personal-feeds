Several technologies could help to meet this need.</p>\n<p>But which approaches could be viable on a commercial scale?</p>\n<p>Toronto-based Hydrostor Inc. is one of the businesses developing long-duration energy storage that has moved beyond lab scale and is now focusing on building big things. The company makes systems that store energy underground in the form of compressed air, which can be released to produce electricity for eight hours or longer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021294#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021294&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"980eacf79804c0bd63dc5ab9513389786ba23ccbec02aad605eee41b35d49faa","category":"Tech"}
