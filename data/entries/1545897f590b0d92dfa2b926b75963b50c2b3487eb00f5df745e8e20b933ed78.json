Change too much, and you risk ruining the careful balance of elements that made the original game work so well. Change too little, and you risk players getting tired of a new title that feels like more of the same.\n<p>As much as we liked <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/spider-man-miles-morales-review-new-hero-same-heroic-gameplay/\">2020’s <i>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</i></a>, the game provided only minor tweaks to the successful formula established by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/spider-man-ps4-review-does-whatever-a-spider-can-and-then-some/\">Insomniac’s original 2018 take on everyone’s favorite wall-crawler</a>. <i>Spider-Man 2</i> is a slightly meatier sequel, with a bigger version of New York City to explore and a few welcome improvements in presentation and gameplay. Even so, the game still fits quite comfortably into the “more of the same” side of the sequel equation.</p>\n<p>But we can’t say we’re too upset about this state of affairs. The basic open-world superheroics of Insomniac’s <i>Spider-Man</i> are so strong that this sequel can get by quite capably with a bit of tinkering at the margins. After three full games, it turns out we’re still not tired of defending Insomniac’s take on New York City.</p>\n<h2>A strained team-up</h2>\n<p>Pretty much every piece of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/gran-turismo-7-spider-man-2-kotor-remake-lead-playstation-5-showcase/\">pre-release hype</a> for <i>Spider-Man 2</i> focused on how the pairing of two separate Spider-Men–Peter Parker and Miles Morales–would implicitly lead to twice as much fun. It’s unfortunate, then, that the long-promised team-up feels more than a little forced here.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976493#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976493&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1545897f590b0d92dfa2b926b75963b50c2b3487eb00f5df745e8e20b933ed78","category":"Tech"}
