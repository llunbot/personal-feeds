They have also resulted in the compromise of network credentials, allowing access to internal networks and databases and tokens for accessing accounts on platforms including OpenAI, Hugging Face, Stripe, and Azure. Besides corrupting models and stealing credentials, attackers behind the campaign have installed cryptocurrency miners on compromised infrastructure, which typically provides massive amounts of computing power. Attackers have also installed reverse shells, which are text-based interfaces for remotely controlling servers.</p>\n<h2>Hitting the jackpot</h2>\n<p>“When attackers get their hands on a Ray production cluster, it is a jackpot,” researchers from Oligo, the security firm that spotted the attacks, wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.oligo.security/blog/shadowray-attack-ai-workloads-actively-exploited-in-the-wild\">post</a>. “Valuable company data plus remote code execution makes it easy to monetize attacks—all while remaining in the shadows, totally undetected (and, with static security tools, undetectable).”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013046#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013046&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a5232e53c5754e24bdcda2ba8bf8908a93393d9480c9552ca09ece9361675230","category":"Tech"}
