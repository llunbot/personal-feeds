The current models have the A14\nchip and 4 gigabytes of memory. Look for the new versions to have\nthe A17 Pro chip, matching the iPad mini, and a bump to 8\ngigabytes of memory. That’s the minimum needed to support the new\nAI platform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/moren-ipad-air-ipad-updates\">new iPads</a> sport the A16 chip and thus do not support Apple Intelligence. But who cares about little details like that when you know the codenames, which is what really matters.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll bet what happened is that Gurman was right, and the new iPads were set to use the A17 Pro chip and support Apple Intelligence.
