But we found one today: <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-iphone-15-unlocked-pristine-black-box-4\">Amazon’s Woot is selling an unlocked iPhone 15 in black for $580</a> (128GB), $610 (256GB), and $695 (512GB), a savings of $149, $189, and $304, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This iPhone 15 isn’t sold by Apple but is promised to be in “Pristine” condition having “never been in customer hands.” Woot says the phone “will arrive with a test sticker showing 100% battery life and inside a sleek custom black box, not the original retail packaging. It comes with a 1-year vendor warranty but isn’t AppleCare-eligible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s a year old, Apple still sells the iPhone 15 for $699 and up. And it’s still a great phone, with an A16 processor, 6.1-inch OLED display, and Apple’s innovative Dynamic Island. We loved it in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2247687/iphone-15-review.html\">4-star review</a> and It’s even better with iOS 18. It will receive updates for years to come, but just note it isn’t compatible with Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want a great iPhone at a great price without needing to jump through carrier hoops, go grab this deal before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save up to $300 on the iPhone 15</span><div><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-iphone-15-unlocked-pristine-black-box-4\" target=\"_blank\">Buy Now at WOOT!</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"eb749bd46c4eea45b4fcafb2cfa94e34e2c2c880ebb286452b4495f096d54349","category":"Apple"}
