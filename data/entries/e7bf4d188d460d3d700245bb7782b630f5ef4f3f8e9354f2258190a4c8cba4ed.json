He spoke about “a cultural tipping point towards once\nagain prioritizing speech” following “nonstop” concerns about\nmisinformation from the “legacy media” and four years of the\nUnited States government “pushing for censorship.” It is clear\nfrom Zuckerberg’s announcement that he views establishment powers\nas having tried and failed to solve political problems by\nsuppressing his users. That message is sure to delight Donald\nTrump and the incoming administration. But there’s one tiny hitch.\nZuckerberg is talking about himself and his own policies. The\nestablishment? That’s him.</p>\n\n<p>The changes to Meta’s properties, including Facebook, Instagram,\nand Threads, are being <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/\">framed</a> by the CEO as a return “to\nour roots around free expression.” This bit of framing is key,\npainting him as having been right all along. It also conveniently\nelides nearly a decade of decisions made by Zuckerberg, who not\nonly is Meta’s founder but also holds a majority of voting power\nin the company, meaning the board cannot vote him out. He is\nMeta’s unimpeachable king. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Zuckerberg’s personal politics have always been inextricably\nlinked to his company’s political and financial interests. Above\nall else, the Facebook founder seems compelled by any ideology\nthat allows the company to grow rapidly and make money without\nhaving to take too much responsibility for what happens on its\nplatforms. Zuckerberg knows which way the political wind is\nblowing and appears to be trying to ride it while, simultaneously,\nbeing at least a little bit afraid of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exactly what I meant by Zuckerberg’s zigging and zagging and now back to zigging <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag\">in my piece earlier this week on Meta’s policy about-face</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/11/warzel-zuck-guy-who-did-this\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e7bf4d188d460d3d700245bb7782b630f5ef4f3f8e9354f2258190a4c8cba4ed","category":"Tech"}
