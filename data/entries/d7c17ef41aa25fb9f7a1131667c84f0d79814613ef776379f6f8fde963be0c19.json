Artists and writers <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/battle-over-books3/\">are fighting</a> for a say in how AI companies use their work, filing lawsuits and publicly agitating against the way these models scrape the Internet and incorporate their art without consent.</p>\n<p>Some companies have responded to this pushback with “opt-out” programs that give people a choice to remove their work from future models. OpenAI, for example, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dall-e-3-open-ai-chat-gpt/\">debuted</a> an opt-out feature with its latest version of the image-to-text generator Dall-E. This August, when Meta began allowing people to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-trains-ai-your-data-opt-out/\">submit requests</a> to delete personal data from third parties used to train Meta’s generative AI models, many artists and journalists interpreted this new process as Meta’s very limited version of an opt-out program. CNBC explicitly referred to the request form as an “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/30/how-to-stop-meta-from-using-personal-data-to-train-generative-ai-.html\">opt-out tool</a>.”</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979173#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979173&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7c17ef41aa25fb9f7a1131667c84f0d79814613ef776379f6f8fde963be0c19","category":"Tech"}
