One of the band members is using an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to edit a picture of the trio in the group, and she uses the Portrait subject focus adjustment feature to focus on herself in the foreground, blurring out her bandmates in the background.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShe hands the ‌iPhone‌ to her bandmate, who edits the image again to change the focus to himself, blurring the background and foreground and cutting her out of the image. The two bicker about which image to use before getting the opinion of the third band member, who taps to focus in on himself, blurring out the other two. In the end, that's the shot they go with.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Turn your photos into portraits,\" reads the tagline of the video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStandard images captured with the Wide camera on an ‌iPhone 15‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> model support focus editing. In the Edit interface, tapping on the aperture icon allows the amount of blur in the background to be adjusted with a slider. This feature is available even when the image was not originally captured in Portrait mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a photo with multiple subjects, the focus of the photo can be changed by tapping on one of the people or objects in the image.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/apple-iphone-15-camera-ad/\">Apple iPhone 15 Ad Highlights Portrait Camera Capabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-iphone-15-ad-highlights-portrait-camera-capabilities.2412606/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1dc7c9a2d23612d9fa54d262f841fdb10b089164ed8ca4a602996fa8cfafa36f","category":"Apple"}
