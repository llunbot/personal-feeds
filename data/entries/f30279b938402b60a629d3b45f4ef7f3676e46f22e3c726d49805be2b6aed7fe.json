And today it’s cheaper than ever: Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smart-Midnight-Aluminum/dp/B0BDJ1MVBV/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch SE for $219 (40mm)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smart-Midnight-Aluminum/dp/B0BDHVMTPD/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$249 (44mm)</a>, a savings of $30 and the lowest price we’ve seen for the latest model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE has a slightly older design than the Series 8, but it still looks great and is packed with features, including a heart-rate sensor, OLED display, and S8 processor. It’s missing an always-on display and some of the higher-end sensors such as temperature and blood-oxygen, but it has Apple’s newest Crash Detection feature that will notify emergency services if you’re wearing it while in a car accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without high-end features, the Apple Watch SE is a perfect entry-level watch for any iPhone user looking to get their first smartwatch. So go grab one at a great price before it goes back up.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f30279b938402b60a629d3b45f4ef7f3676e46f22e3c726d49805be2b6aed7fe","category":"Apple"}
