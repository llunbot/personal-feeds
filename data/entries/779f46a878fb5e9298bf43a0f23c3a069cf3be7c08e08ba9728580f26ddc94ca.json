{"title":"Wirecutter’s ‘Best’ Drip Coffee Makers Pooh-Poohs the Two Best Drip Coffee Makers","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/","date":1630708366000,"content":"\n<p>Here’s a perfect example of what I was talking about in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/03/wirecutter-paywall\">the previous item</a>, about <s>The</s> Wirecutter institutionally fetishizing price over quality. And within “quality” I include design aesthetics, which, let’s face it, almost always goes hand-in-hand with price.</p>\n\n<p>From their current list of “best” drip coffee makers, which is topped by OXO’s $200 <a href=\"https://www.oxo.com/categories/coffee-tea/brew/coffee-makers/barista-brain-9-cup-coffee-maker.html\">Brew 9-Cup</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can find a number of expensive, stylish coffee makers made in\nsmall quantities for enthusiast audiences. <a href=\"https://clivecoffee.com/products/ratio-eight-coffee-maker\">Clive Coffee’s Ratio\nEight</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/ottomatic-2-0-coffeemaker.html\">Chemex Ottomatic</a> are two prominent\nexamples. They’re all made for connoisseurs who are willing to\nspend a lot on a high-end machine. The main draw of these coffee\nmakers is that they brew similarly to manually making a batch of\npour-over — pre-infusing the grounds and evenly pouring the hot\nwater. For the price, however, it’s hard to see any concrete\nbenefits to these machines, and they’re also less widely available\nthan our top picks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ratio Eight costs $495, and the Chemex Ottomatic $350. They don’t just brew coffee <em>similarly</em> to pour-over, they brew pour-over. The difference is only that they’re automatic. And pour-over coffee tastes better than the stuff regular drip coffee makers brew.</p>\n\n<p>The “concrete benefits” to these machines is that they make better-tasting coffee <em>and</em> they look better on your kitchen counter. Yes, $350/495 is significantly more than $200, but many coffee lovers gladly spend $5 a cup every day for pour-over coffee from a good coffee shop. Many people pay close to that for drip coffee from <a href=\"http://bad.coffee/\">not-so-good</a> coffee shops.</p>\n\n<p>I was recently at <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2021/05/25/ep-314\">a friend</a>’s house who owns the Ratio Eight and it’s a splendid device. Me, I’ll stick with my manual pour-over method, if only for the ritual, but if I were going to buy a machine to automate it, I don’t think I’d consider anything other than a Ratio. Also, Ratio makes <a href=\"https://ratiocoffee.com/products/ratio-thermal-carafe-with-porcelain-dripper\">the best thermal carafe</a> I’ve ever seen — I ordered one of those. I expect to use it for a decade, if not longer.</p>\n\n<p>Wirecutter’s description of these two coffee makers is criminal. But at least they did mention them. In many other categories, superior but more-expensive products don’t even get a mention from Wirecutter. I think there’s a huge market opportunity here for a quality-and-design-first rival.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/03/wirecutter-coffee-makers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"779f46a878fb5e9298bf43a0f23c3a069cf3be7c08e08ba9728580f26ddc94ca","category":"Tech"}
