Muuvr incentivises users to have an active lifestyle.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get rewarded for every effort, big or small</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pairing with apps such as Apple Fitness, Wahoo and Garmin Connect, Muuvr calculates how many Muuvs a user has earned using its bespoke sports science that is benchmarked against each user’s unique activity effort. This means everyone’s earning potential is on the same level, regardless of age, gender or ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We look at how active you have been over the last 90 days. The more active you have been, the higher the activity level and the higher reward you earn every day,’ says Vickers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Because you earn every day, you’ll still earn on a rest day, if you get injured or if you decide to have some time off the bike. And if you complete a particular challenge or a goal, you will often be rewarded with extra Muuvs.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Cyclist Challenge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclist and Muuvr are partnering to offer three unique challenges on the Muuvr app over the winter months. These will be a great opportunity to experience the app and earn more Muuvs if you complete them. We also have some great prizes up for grabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take part in <a href=\"https://appmuuvr.page.link/muuvments?id=872d9fbd-c2b5-4f5d-b83e-79070f513d16\" target=\"_blank\">C</a><a href=\"https://appmuuvr.page.link/muuvments?id=872d9fbd-c2b5-4f5d-b83e-79070f513d16\" target=\"_blank\">yclist Challenge Number One</a>, download Muuvr and join the Cyclist Brand Hub to enrol.

The app has seven career ranks, which are unlocked by completing activities. Moving through the ranks helps motivate users to set new personal records, tackle challenges and unlock in-app achievements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Connect with like-minded people</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the Muuvr community, there is bucketloads of inspiration to keep you going. Muuvrs can participate in challenges, join clubs and compare their performance with others, all the while experiencing the joy of camaraderie, shared goals and the power of a supportive community. ‘Muuvr connects athletes to everything that’s important to them: friends, brands they like to hear from and their own fitness journey,’ says Vickers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We do this in a new and innovative way, but what’s really cool is that we amplify all of this by rewarding you for doing more. These are emotional rewards and real-world rewards, and it’s going to motivate users in new ways and make them more active.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More than just an app</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"475\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-475x970.jpg\" alt=\"Muuvr advertorial\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-475x970.jpg 475w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-147x300.jpg 147w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-768x1567.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-753x1536.jpg 753w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-1004x2048.jpg 1004w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-750x1531.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3-1140x2327.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/muuvr-advertorial-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Muuvr is different to typical fitness apps. Unlike Strava, for instance, Muuvr says it offers a more intimate, tight-knit community experience, fostering deeper connections and more personal interactions. It inspires users to get active and rewards them for this, rather than focussing on plotting and recording activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muuvr rallies its community around new technology and ownership of data and elements inside the platform. Collectables take the form of unlocks, rewards and achievements expressed as digital items such as images, sounds or videos. Some are unique to individual athletes, providing ownership in a new way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with many applications, Muuvr shares user data with brand partners, but allows you to opt out completely. If you do consent to share data, Muuvr will compensate you with Muuvs (through your activities) for this process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Muuvr is committed to making the user experience even better. CTO Evan Tomlin says, ‘We know we’ve got work to do. We want to build Muuvr with our users – we want feedback! Doing it this way, we’re going to create something athletes want. It’s empowering.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pioneering the fitness community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Muuvr is so much more than just an app, and by signing up you can embrace the thrill of being a pioneer in a ground-breaking community that’s revolutionising the cycling world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Things are changing in the world at an unstoppable pace,’ says Vickers. ‘We’re on the edge of a new era that will change how we interact with each other, pushing the limits of technology to create new, engaging and rewarding experiences.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experience the exhilaration of innovation, and contribute to a world that moves more, together.
