In the letter, the artists call on AI developers, technology companies, platforms, and digital music services to stop using AI to \"infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\" A <a href=\"https://x.com/artistrightsnow/status/1775163089509331299?s=20\">tweet</a> from the ARA added that AI poses an \"existential threat\" to their art.</p>\n\n<p>Visual artists <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/\">began protesting</a> the advent of generative AI after the rise of the first mainstream <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/\">AI image generators</a> in 2022, and considering that generative AI research has since been undertaken for other forms of creative media, we have seen that protest extend to professionals in other creative domains, such as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-vs-hollywood-writers-battle-plagiarism-machines-in-union-talks/\">writers</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/fran-drescher-we-are-all-going-to-be-in-jeopardy-of-being-replaced-by-machines/\">actors</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/i-just-dont-see-how-we-survive-tyler-perry-issues-hollywood-warning-over-ai-video-tech/\">filmmakers</a>â€”and now musicians.</p>\n<p>\"When used irresponsibly, AI poses enormous threats to our ability to protect our privacy, our identities, our music and our livelihoods,\" the open letter states. It alleges that some of the \"biggest and most powerful\" companies (unnamed in the letter) are using the work of artists without permission to train AI models, with the aim of replacing human artists with AI-created content.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014327#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014327&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0c445503cd7aec287b3b6078565b7fe3d5c0674f8b84a1bb204b3d421745eba1","category":"Tech"}
