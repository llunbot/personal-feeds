In real life, people only detect voice clones about <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2023/04/descript-playht-ai-voice-copy.html\">50% of the time</a>. You might as well flip a coin. And that makes businesses extremely vulnerable to attacks.</p>\n\n<p>In the “classic” voice clone scam, the caller is after an immediate payout (“Hi, it’s me, your boss. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/09/03/a-voice-deepfake-was-used-to-scam-a-ceo-out-of-243000/\">Wire a bunch of company money</a> to this account ASAP”). Then there are the more complex social engineering attacks, where a phone call is just the entryway to break into a company’s systems and steal data or plant malware (that’s what happened in the <a href=\"https://l.kolide.co/3TB3FF8\">MGM attack</a>, albeit without the use of AI).</p>\n\n<p>But the good news is that we can be trained to learn how to identify suspicious phone calls — even when the voice sounds just like someone we trust.
