The vehicle, called the Stella Vita, was made by Eindhoven University of Technology students.</p>\n<p>Solar Team Eindhoven's 22 members previously created a smaller solar-powered family car called the <a href=\"https://solarteameindhoven.nl/stella-family\">Stella Lux</a>. According to Tijn Ter Horst, a member of the team and a mechanical engineering student at the university, the Stella Lux was energy-positive. “She could power other electric vehicles because she had so much energy left,” Ter Horst told Ars.</p>\n<p>After producing the Stella Lux, the team began brainstorming future projects and came up with the idea of a home-like vehicle powered entirely by the Sun. In March, the students started constructing a tear-shaped solar mobile home, and they recently completed the project.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795690#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795690&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Doug Johnson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b23537bc3dfa4f1b18ce0b0ecef153f6f2894328f552c87af0ad8c4c08e9817","category":"Tech"}
