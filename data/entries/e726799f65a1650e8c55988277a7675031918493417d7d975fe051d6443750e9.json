Nulling an alt description means there is no information between the opening and close quotes. If there is an empty space, it will not be considered nulled:</p>\n\n<pre>\n  <code>&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/cat.jpg\" /&gt;</code>\n</pre>\n<em>This image has been nulled.</em>\n\n\n\n<pre>\n  <code>&lt;img alt=\" \" src=\"/images/dog.jpg\" /&gt;</code>\n</pre>\n<em>This image has not been nulled.</em>\n\n\nWhat Does “Decorative” Mean?\n<p>Nulling an image indicates that it is for decorative purposes only. </p>\n<p>In this context, decorative means that the image <strong>does not visually communicate information</strong> that is important to understanding the purpose of the page or view, and why the image is included as a part of that.</p>\n<p> Decorative does not mean that the image contains content that is considered as decoration.</p>\n<p>For example, a website that sells wallpaper will want to have alternate descriptions for wallpaper samples:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/products/umbrella?variant=73849024783051\"&gt;\n  &lt;img \n    alt=\"Small red and white illustrated umbrellas on a teal background.\"\n    src=\"/images/73849024783051.png\" /&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another example could be a museum website, where presenting a piece from their collection could benefit from <a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com/blog/alt-vs-figcaption\">both an alternate description and a caption</a>:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;figure \n  role=\"figure\"\n  aria-label=\"View of Rotterdam, by Cornelis Boumeester.

The reasons for wanting to do this are mostly historical.</p>\n<h3>Old Layout Techniques</h3>\n<p>Early web development techniques relied on images to help them guarantee <strong>consistent layout</strong> across different operating systems, browsers, and browser versions. The most common example of this was a <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacer_GIF\"><code>spacer.gif</code></a>, a 1×1 transparent pixel that was stretched to different sizes to push content into place.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/64430e56-7d61-49cb-a764-fe64aa2b805e/spacer-gif.png\" /></p>\n<p>This technique would typically use many <strong>spacing images</strong> to create a visual design. Without a way to silence their presence, these images would clutter up what assistive technology announced and make it confusing and time-consuming to navigate and take action on web content.</p>\n<h3>Old Design Techniques</h3>\n<p>Before there were CSS properties such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow\"><code>box-shadow</code></a>, developers had to use techniques that chopped up the decorative styling to make it work with content of indeterminate height or width. This technique was called <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling\">9-slice scaling</a>, a term that refers to the 9 sections of content you would need to create.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74359175-f885-45e4-9916-33f49b8b516a/9-slice-scaling-technique.png\" /></p>\n<p>Much like spacer images, 9-slice scaling used multiple images to create the desired visual effect. And, much like spacer images, the only way to <strong>remove the clutter</strong> these images created was to mark them as decorative.</p>\n<h3>Redundant Announcements</h3>\n<p>There is the rare scenario where an image is repeated on a page or view, and it’s repeat placements don’t supply any additional context. You should be careful about marking an image decorative in this situation, as the lack of an announcement for a visible image may be confusing for <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2017/02/not-all-screen-reader-users-are-blind.html\">someone with low vision who is using a screen reader</a>.</p>\n<h3>Supplemental Icons</h3>\n<p>Links and buttons that use icons should always have <a href=\"https://www.tpgi.com/what-is-an-accessible-name/\">an accessible name</a> that communicates functionality. If the design also incorporates an icon, the icon’s design does not need to be communicated.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"icon-print.svg\" alt=\"\" /&gt;\n  Print\n&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the component only uses an icon, the image itself should be used to create the accessible name:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"icon-print.svg\" alt=\"Print.\" /&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that a visible text label is the preferred technique. A visible text label <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/aria-label-does-not-translate.html\">can be translated</a> and <a href=\"https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-icon-is-a-text-label\">communicates purpose more directly</a>. </p>\n\n\n<em>I have no idea what this button does.</em>\n\n\nContemporary Use\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/display-grid-subgrid/\">Modern CSS layout</a> and styling techniques means that image placement is now highly intentional. This means that if an image is used, it is most likely going to need an alternate description.</p>\n<p>Alternate descriptions should <strong>communicate the image’s purpose</strong>. That includes the image’s content, but may also include the reason it is included in context on the page or view it has been included in. This is one of the reasons <a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2021-03-23-alternate-text-and-automation/\">why alternate image descriptions will never be able to be fully automated</a>.</p>\nOther Ways Of Displaying Images\n<p>There are a few other ways to display an image on a page or view. It is important to ensure an alternate description is provided if the image contains <strong>meaningful content</strong> — regardless of the technique utilized.</p>\n<h3>The <code>picture</code> Element</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture\"><code>picture</code> element</a> does not have <a href=\"https://www.tpgi.com/html5-accessibility-chops-when-to-use-an-aria-role/\">an implicit role</a>, meaning that its presence does not communicate any purpose to assistive technology. This means it can’t be used to semantically describe the presence of a “picture.”</p>\n<p>The <code>picture</code> element is a container for <code>source</code> and <code>img</code> elements. Use the <code>img</code>  element’s <code>alt</code>  attribute to provide an alternate description for the parent <code>picture</code> element.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/product/9091866/color/3\"&gt;\n  &lt;picture&gt;\n    &lt;source \n      srcset=\"9091866-3.avif\" \n      type=\"image/avif\" /&gt;\n    &lt;img \n      alt=\"A black ankle-length boot with metal eyelets, yellow stitching, and a padded collar and tongue.\"\n      src=\"9091866-3.png\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/picture&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Background Images</h3>\n<p>We can use CSS to declare an image as a background on an HTML element. This is most often used to add a sense of texture to a design. </p>\n<p>However, another popular technique is to use a <code>background-image</code> to place an image in such a way where the developer will not have control over the <strong>size of the image</strong> someone uploads. <code>background-image</code>, combined with other properties such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size\"><code>background-size</code></a> will ensure that content of an unknown size is displayed without breaking the design.</p>\n<p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/OJprPwK\">Background Image As Foreground Image Example</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/ericwbailey\">Eric Bailey</a>.</p>\n<p>In a scenario like this, <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/note/2020/02/13/spacer-gifs-in-2020.html\">our old friend <code>spacer.gif</code> might be helpful again</a>!</p>\n<h3>Inline SVG</h3>\n<p>SVG can be displayed by either linking to it via the <code>src</code> attribute in an <code>img</code> element, or by placing the SVG code inline in the page or view.</p>\n<p>If you are using inline SVG, you need to <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/accessible-svg-patterns-comparison/\">use SVG’s <code>title</code> (and potentially <code>desc</code>) element</a> in place of an <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;svg \n  role=\"img\" \n  aria-labelledby=\"icon-bookmark-desc\"\n  xmlns=\"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;\">http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"</a> width=\"24\" height=\"24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"&gt;\n  &lt;title id=\"icon-bookmark-desc\"&gt;Bookmark.&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;path d=\"M19 21l-7-5-7 5V5a2 2 0 012-2h10a2 2 0 012 2z\"/&gt;\n&lt;/svg&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n\n\nEquivalent Experience\n<p>In modern web design and development, displaying an image is a highly intentional act. Alternate descriptions allow us to explain the content of the image, and in doing so, <strong>communicate why it is worth including</strong>. </p>\n<p>Just because an image displays something fanciful doesn’t mean it isn’t worth describing. Announcing its presence ensures that <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/equivalent-experiences-part1/\">anyone, regardless of ability or circumstance</a>, can fully understand your digital experience.</p>\n<h3>Further Reading on SmashingMag:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/accessibility-chrome-devtools/\">Accessibility In Chrome DevTools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/complete-guide-accessibility-tooling/\">A Complete Guide To Accessibility Tooling</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/accessible-images/\">Accessible Images For When They Matter Most</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/accessible-svg-patterns-comparison/\">Accessible SVGs: Perfect Patterns For Screen Reader Users</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/design-reduced-motion-sensitivities/\">Designing With Reduced Motion For Motion Sensitivities</a></li>\n<li>Read more articles on <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/accessibility/\">accessibility</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/usability\">usability</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/ux\">UX</a>.</li>\n</ul>","author":"","siteTitle":"Articles on Smashing Magazine — For Web Designers And Developers","siteHash":"ab069ca35bf300e9db0da36f49701f66485a5b0d2db0471dfeee07cef6204939","entryHash":"e726799f65a1650e8c55988277a7675031918493417d7d975fe051d6443750e9","category":"Tech"}
