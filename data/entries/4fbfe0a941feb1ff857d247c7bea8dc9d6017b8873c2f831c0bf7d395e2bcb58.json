The products, members of the extremely popular and effective class of GLP-1 drugs, had been on the shortage list since December 2022.</p>\n<p>Being on the list meant that compounding pharmacies were legally allowed to make \"<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/98964/download\">essentially copies</a>\" of the products; the only time these pharmacies—also called outsourcing facilities—can make imitation versions of approved drugs, such as tirzepatide, is when the products appear on the shortage list. So, with the FDA's announcement, compounders were immediately barred from making any more of the lucrative drugs and had 60 days to fulfill existing orders.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/drugmakers-can-keep-making-off-brand-weight-loss-drugs-as-fda-backpedals/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/drugmakers-can-keep-making-off-brand-weight-loss-drugs-as-fda-backpedals/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4fbfe0a941feb1ff857d247c7bea8dc9d6017b8873c2f831c0bf7d395e2bcb58","category":"Tech"}
