Retailing at $110 USD, the Tactic is costs $10 more than its predecessor; that extra cash gets you a rotational impact protection upgrade to MIPS Evolve, improved integration with sunglasses and goggles and increased coverage, in addition to the dramatically more modern trail/enduro aesthetic. Here’s how we got on with it.</p><h2>Review: Specialized Tactic 4</h2><div id=\"attachment_274428\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-274428\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review.jpg\" alt=\"specialized tactic 4 helmet review side view\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060700/specialized-tactic-4-trail-helemt-review-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-274428\">The cam divider on the chin strap is not adjustable, the advantage being that the straps either side of the ear can’t get too long or too short over time, so the fit is always safe</p></div><p>The Specialized Tactic 4 open-face mountain bike helmet is suited to a wide range of off-road riding from gravel to enduro, though its weight (364g in small) and generous coverage push its niche closer to the trail riding end of that spectrum. Tested to the Dutch e-Bike Standard NTA8776 certification, it is also approved for eMTB.&nbsp;</p><p>At $110 USD, we mark the Tactic 4 as a fairly reasonably priced mountain bike helmet. Especially, when you consider the extended rear coverage, thick EPS shell, and MIPS Evolve liner. From a safety point of view it certainly ticks all the boxes.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner.jpg\" alt=\"specialized tactic 4 helmet review mips evolve liner\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060637/specialized-tactic-4-mips-evolve-liner-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>While the in-molded EPS absorbs forces from direct hits, the super thin MIPS Evolve Liner deals with the rotational forces that are present on impacts where the head is forced to rotate. This new liner is lighter than the MIPS-C2 liner you’ll see on similarly priced helmets in this category, and also better suited to helmets that feature a lot of vents. The liner attaches to the EPS shell via several elasticated rubber pucks that allow the liner to move 10-15mm in any direction independently to the outer shell.</p><div id=\"attachment_274415\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-274415\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial.jpg\" alt=\"specialized tactic 4 helmet review rear fit dial\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060616/specialized-tactic-4-adjustment-dial-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-274415\">Integrating the fit adjustment dial into the body of the helmet allowed Specialized to extend the rear coverage even further</p></div><p>The fit system is of reasonably good quality. It runs 360°, tightened via a ratcheting dial that is recessed into the body of the helmet, rather than floating below it. This makes the helmet a little more ponytail-friendly, as hair is less likely to get tangled up in the mechanism as you tighten and loosen it off. Still, you’ll need to wear that ponytail fairly low for a safe fit.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible.jpg\" alt=\"specialized tactic 4 helmet review rear fit adjustment\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060631/specialized-tactic-4-inside-view-fot-system-agi-compatible-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Over tightening the fit system reveals no uncomfortable pressure points; it seems to tighten evenly right the way around the head. The three-part comfort liner is plenty padded. The fit system is also vertically adjustable. You can move the occipital cradle between 5 positions to find the best position for the unique shape of your head.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment.jpg\" alt=\"specialized tactic 4 helmet review occipital fit adjustment\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060644/specialized-tactic-4-occipital-fit-adjustment-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>I did note one potential issue, however. The occipital cradle adjustment arms, which insert directly into the helmet body, can quite easily be pulled out entirely if you accidentally pull them too far. That said, you can simply slide them back in again, where they click back into place. Having given it some thought, and after yanking the rear of the helmet forward quite enthusiastically, I’ve concluded this wouldn’t actually become an issue. With the chin strap tightened sufficiently, those plastic arms shouldn’t ever come under undue strain causing them to release from the helmet body.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb.jpg\" alt=\"specialized tactic 4 helmet review front vents\" width=\"1600\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb-297x99.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb-800x267.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb-120x40.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb-768x256.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060627/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-trail-enduro-mtb-1536x512.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Tactic 4 is pretty well-ventilated. The position and size of the 17 vents is well thought-out with a voluminous cavity running over the top of the skull from front to rear, helping heat and moisture escape. The peak is a good size, long enough to hide from the sun a little, but not so long that I can see the end of it while riding.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage.jpg\" alt=\"specialized tactic 4 helmet review julbo goggles stowed\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12060623/specialized-tactic-4-helmet-review-fitment-julbo-goggles-stowage-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The peak position is fixed, so you can’t lift your goggles from your face and stow them underneath it.
