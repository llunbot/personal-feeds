But bear with caller, because there’s also a plot twist – they're not actually pedals. No, instead of incorporating power sensors into a complete set of pedals as in the case of the existing Look-compatible <a href=\"/reviews/5091/favero-assioma-duo-power-pedals-review\" target=\"_blank\">Favero Assioma Duo</a>, the Assioma Duo-Shi are actually just the spindles that sit within the pedal body.</p>\n<p>They use the same pod as Favero’s existing pedals to measure the rider’s power but now, seemingly to introduce Shimano-compatibility, £555 doesn't get you an entire set of power meter pedals but instead just the axles that you'll need to install in a pair of existing or newly bought pedal bodies. Sounds like a bit of a faff, doesn’t it? Well it kind of is and it kind of isn’t.</p>\n<h2>Favero Assioma Duo-Shi pedal compatibility</h2>\n<p>There is no new technology at play here from Favero – the spindles are the same as those used in the existing Assioma Duo power pedals. The big change comes in regards to compatibility.</p>\n<p>While the current Assioma Duo pedals work with Look Keo and Favero’s own in-house cleats, these latest Assioma Duo-Shi spindles are now Shimano-compatible, and designed to work with pedal bodies from the following models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shimano PD-R8000</li>\n<li>Shimano PD-R7000</li>\n<li>Shimano PD-6800</li>\n<li>Shimano PD-R550</li>\n<li>Shimano PD-R540</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eagle-eyed readers will notice the omission of Shimano’s <a href=\"/shimano/1391/shimano-dura-ace-9100-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Dura-Ace R9100</a> pedals – these run on a different spindle so are therefore not compatible. Tough luck, Dura-Ace pedal users.</p>\n<p>Now, did Favero really need to introduce a new spindle for Shimano compatibility? If you wanted to use Favero Assioma’s power pedals, couldn’t you just convert over to Look cleats or use the ones provided by Favero?</p>\n<p>Cyclists are often very particular about what they ride, so a Shimano option was always going to be on the cards, it’s just surprising it comes in the form of a pedal spindle rather than the entire pedal. I fail to see any real benefits in this, if I’m honest. Surely, like say <a href=\"/reviews/9404/garmin-rally-power-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin’s Rally RS200 power pedals</a>, it would have been cleaner to develop a full pedal? Of course there may be a good reason to do with patents and licensing we're not aware of.</p>\n<p>The good thing about these pedals however – and any pedal-based power meter for that matter – is that once set-up, they can be transferred between bikes within minutes, giving you power data on any bike you own. This is a major advantage compared to crank-based systems.</p>\n<h2>Favero Assioma Duo-Shi assembly and set-up</h2>\n<p>I'm relieved to report the Favero Assioma Duo-Shi power pedals are incredibly easy to set-up because despite being digital editor of Cyclist and a millennial, I’m in no way a bike mechanic. I’m pretty useless beyond changing an inner tube and using Instagram, so when I say this was easy, you can really take my word for it.</p>\n<p>In the box you get the pair of spindles, a pedal wrench, the charger block and charger cable, power adapters and some washers – everything you need for the pedals except from the pedal bodies themselves. You also get a set of instructions that on the face of it look complicated, but aren't.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/10/screenshot_2021-10-26_at_12.38.47.png?itok=kl784pyX\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/10/favero-assioma-duo-shi-power-meter-1.jpg?itok=ZTD5R1Sl\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/10/favero-assioma-duo-shi-power-meter-1_0.jpg?itok=zo0O_XF_\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In reality, all the instructions are asking you to do is remove the existing spindle from your pedals using a 17mm wrench (or Shimano's TL-PD40 tool for R7000, R550 and R540 pedals) and then insert your Favero spindles in their place with a 19mm wrench, a job that takes less than two minutes combined.</p>\n<p>From there, all you have to do is mount the pedals onto your bike – with a spacer – like you would your regular pedals, and you’re basically good to go.</p>\n<p>Next up you wake the pedals by attaching them to the charger while simultaneously downloading the Favero app, which takes you through the activation process (which includes inputting crank length – very important if you want accurate power) needed for your pedals to begin transmitting data. Again, a job that takes less than a minute.</p>\n<p>Once activated, you connect the pedals to your GPS computer – in my case the <a href=\"/wahoo/elemnt-roam\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo Elemnt Roam</a> – and then go for a short ride around the block doing three or four sprints to help calibrate the pedals. Once you’ve done that, the app will then ask you to perform a 'manual calibration' which is the final step before they’re ready and, again, takes less than a minute.</p>\n<p>Once all that's done, your pedals will be synced and calibrated and you’re ready to go. From unboxing to riding genuinely took less than five minutes, which was a very pleasant surprise.</p>\n<h2>Favero Assioma Duo-Shi power meter accuracy</h2>\n<p>Commenting on power meter accuracy is always a tough one. Favero claims an accuracy of +/- 1.0% but unless you commit to hours of independent testing using multiple power meters simultaneously on multiple bikes/indoor trainers in a controlled environment, you cannot make a judgement on whether that's a valid claim.</p>\n<p>Such testing is beyond the scope of this review but gear tester DC Rainmaker has carried out a more in-depth comparison and you can read his full review <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/07/assioma-shimano-variant.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>To summarise his great work, he found the new Assioma Duo-Shi power meter to be as accurate as previous Favero units, and as accurate as anything else on the market.</p>\n<h2>Riding and maintaining the Favero Assioma Duo-Shi power meter pedals</h2>\n<p>Day-to-day, once set up, these pedals require little attention. Each pedal has an advertised 50 hours battery life with charging possible while the pedals are still attached to the bike. Once connected to your head unit, the pedals will be continually remembered and the only reason you will need to return to the Favero app after assembly is to perform the odd firmware update a few times a year.</p>\n<p>Thinking long-term, while you can't simply fill the Assiomas with grease as you would a standard Shimano pedal, Favero does offer DIY bearing replacement kits for its pedal spindles at a cost of €32 for a complete set of bearings.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/10/screenshot_2021-10-26_at_12.38.55.png?itok=_lhYP8Qi\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>On the road, the only real issue I found was clipping in. With the pods, your pedal stance width is increased ever so slightly by about 10mm each side. In theory, this sounds miniscule and it's highly unlikely to affect your pedalling efficiency. However, what it does do is slightly push out the point you're aiming for when you clip into your pedal, which actually proved a bigger issue than I was expecting.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8998/how-to-keep-your-feet-warm-while-cycling-in-winter\">How to keep your feet warm while cycling in winter</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10158/gallery-a-paris-roubaix-for-the-ages\">Gallery: A Paris-Roubaix for the ages</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/2191/buyers-guide-18-cold-weather-riding-essentials\">Buyer's guide: 18 cold weather riding essentials</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nI’ve clipped in literally thousands of times and muscle memory has trained my brain to put my left foot in a particular spot. With the Assioma pedals' pods shifting the pedal outwards slightly, I found I couldn't clip in on my first attempt. It was so frustrating and it took me a good few weeks to adjust to the change.</p>\n<p>It’s such a small issue, but it really nagged like a dripping tap, or a faint rattle coming from within your frame.</p>\n<h2>Favero Assioma Duo-Shi value for money</h2>\n<p>At £555, the Favero Assioma Dua-Shi power meter pedals sound expensive at face value and yes, that’s a lot considering you still need to supply your own pedal bodies for them to work. However if you compare them to their biggest rival, the Garmin Rally RS200, then it’s actually not too bad.</p>\n<p>The Rally pedals do come as a complete pedal and with a spindle that can be transferred over to Garmin’s mountain bike SPD pedals (bought separately) but are also £509 more expensive for the same claimed power accuracy.</p>\n<p>So even if you need to buy a set of Shimano Ultegra PD-R8000 pedals (which can usually be picked up for <a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/shimano-ultegra-r8000-spd-sl-carbon-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">a little over £100 on Wiggle</a>) to use with the Favero Assioma Duo-Shi, you are still saving £400, the only compromise being you have to assemble them yourself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/favero-assioma-duo-shi-power-meter\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Favero Assioma Duo-Shi power pedals from Wiggle for £555</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favero Assioma Duo-Shi review verdict</h2>\n<p>Get past the fact that you only get the spindles, which is a tad annoying, and you’re left with what are ultimately a very good set of power meter pedals, sorry spindles. Easy to set up, clean, versatile, accurate and cheaper than its closest rivals. </p>\n  </div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"587b203a9d1567470452a94026eee62b8a542a736174850985d5071e1440d6e6","category":"Cycling"}
