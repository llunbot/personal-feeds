After all, we never know when a crash is going to happen.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, upper body armour has become lighter and less restrictive compared to the bulky suits of years gone by.</p>\n<p>Many now employ protective materials such as D30 or Koroyd and have high stretch or breathable fabrics to create comfortable and secure fits. This makes it easier to wear more of the time –  which consequently means you are better protected on more of your rides.</p>\n<p>It’s important to consider what type of riding you do when choosing upper body protection for mountain biking (or, in fact, any type of protection). The more extreme your type of riding, the more protection you will need.</p>\n<p>If you’re taking to relatively easy trails and spend more time pedalling than heading downhill, lightweight protection might be suitable for you.</p>\n<p>If you’re racing in downhill events, riding black trails or sending some big jumps, you should invest in a jacket or suit that will protect more of your body.</p>\n<p>Our pick of the best body armour for mountain biking includes options for all manners of riding. Our expert team of independent testers have racked up hours of riding and considered protection, fit, comfort, extra features and price when scoring these products.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should always wear a helmet when mountain biking, so be sure to check out our picks of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">best mountain bike helmets</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-helmets/\">best enduro helmets</a>.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Best body armour for mountain biking, as rated and reviewed by BikeRadar </h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Leatt Body Tee AirFlex Stealth:</strong> £190 / $200 </li>\n<li><strong>Alpinestars Evolution LS:</strong> £190 </li>\n<li><strong>Bluegrass Armour Lite:</strong> £120</li>\n<li><strong>Fox Baseframe Pro D30 Guard:</strong> £169 / $260</li>\n<li><strong>SixSixOne Recon Advance:</strong> £215</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Leatt Body Tee AirFlex Stealth</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Leatt’s Body Tee is comfortable enough to wear all day and is compatible with Leatt’s neck brace, for further protection</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £190 / $200 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Leatt’s Body Tee AirFlex Stealth slimline top is light and comfy enough to wear all day, and the open mesh fabric means it doesn’t feel too hot on long climbs.</p>\n<p>The AirFlex (soft impact gel) back and shoulder padding provide Level 1 protection – a European safety standard that means the maximum transmitted force must be lower than 18kN with no single value exceeding 24kN.</p>\n<p>The large chest panel adds peace of mind, and all are highly flexible.</p>\n<p>It’s designed to integrate seamlessly with Leatt’s neck brace, with loops and a removable section of padding at the neck.</p>\n<p>An off-centre zip makes putting it on a cinch, and the zip shield prevents any skin irritation.

They are used to tell you the effectiveness of the armour in absorbing or withstanding impacts. </p>\n<p>The two levels refer to different amounts of force:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>CE level 1:</strong> the maximum transmitted force must be below 18kN, and no single value shall exceed 24kN</li>\n<li><strong>CE level 2: </strong>the maximum transmitted force must be below 9kN, and no single value shall exceed 12kN</li>\n</ul><p>Armour for mountain biking is often rated to CE Level 1. Some mountain biking armour is rated to CE Level 2, but this is more common in motorcycling, due to the higher speeds of the sport. </p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Alpinestars Evolution LS</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Alpinestars Evolution LS has routing for a hydration pack hose.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £190 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Alpinestars Evolution LS armour jacket has been discontinued but it’s still available to buy.</p>\n<p>We found it to be comfortable in testing and, while the spine protector may appear bulky, it goes unnoticed when riding.</p>\n<p>This jacket has a number of handy features, including a compartment for a hydration bladder and removable sleeves – if you want to use it as a vest without shoulder or elbow protection.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the cutaways under the arms mean the shoulder pads can move around a bit, but they do create plenty of ventilation.</p>\n<p>In terms of comfort, features and ergonomics, this jacket is up with the best.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/armour-and-pads/suit/alpinestars-evolution-ls-armour-jacket-review/\">Read our full Alpinestars Evolution LS armour jacket review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Bluegrass Armour Lite</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The three rear pockets are ideal for stashing kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £120 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Bluegrass Armour Lite was updated for 202o with a new three-layer EVA-foam back panel that offers protection across a wider section of the upper back, and it extends down the small of the back too.</p>\n<p>Our size small came up true to size with enough room for a baselayer underneath.
