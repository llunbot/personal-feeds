While Apple works on a fix, a handful of users have had some success by changing the setting \"Allow accessories to connect\" to \"Ask for new accessories\" under the Security section of System Settings ➝ Privacy &amp; Security.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Java Processes </span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Unexpected Terminations</span><br />\r<br />\nOracle last week warned that the macOS 14.4 update can cause Java processes to \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/16/oracle-warns-about-macos-14-4-java-issues/\">terminate unexpectedly</a>\" on Macs. The issue affects all Java versions from Java 8 to the early access builds of JDK 22, and there is no workaround available. Affected users might be unable to return to a stable configuration unless they have a complete backup of their systems prior to the OS update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>Printer Operation</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Removed or Corrupted Drivers</span><br />\r<br />\nThe update may <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255522015?sortBy=best\">remove or corrupt printer drivers</a>. Specifically, the core CUPS software for printing operations over a network seems to be removed. HP printers in particular appear to be affected, but the exact commonalities between the reports, such as the use of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1b9n1mj/new_mac_os_144_update_broke_printing_no_drivers/\">Microsoft Defender or JAMF mobile device management software</a>, are not entirely clear. Some users have found a workaround by granting Full Disk Access to certain processes in System Settings ➝ Privacy &amp; Security. Despite these attempts, a comprehensive solution has not yet been found.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<span>PACE/iLok Protections</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Audio Unit Plugins Crash</span><br />\r<br />\nThere have been reports of compatibility issues with PACE products, including the <a href=\"https://help.ilok.com/faq_licenses.html#sonoma_14_4_plugins\">iLok License Manager</a>, connected to Apple silicon Macs running macOS 14.4. The problem specifically impacts plugins from various manufacturers that are safeguarded by PACE/iLok, including those <a href=\"https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24492336117652-PACE-iLok-Issue-with-macOS-Sonoma-14-4-Update\">made by Universal Audio</a>, when used with host DAWs such as Logic Pro. Temporarily setting a DAW and the iLok License Manager application to <a href=\"https://help.ilok.com/faq_licenses.html#sonoma_14_4_plugins\">run in Rosetta mode</a> appears to circumvent the issue. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Consider Not Updating</h2>\r<br />\nIf you anticipate that any of these problems could significantly impact your daily operations or productivity, it may be prudent to delay updating to the latest version of macOS Sonoma until Apple addresses these concerns with a subsequent fix.
