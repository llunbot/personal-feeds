We say \"nearly\" because we had this hands-on birthday post written ahead of time, asking, \"How is this project still running?\", but someone at Google was apparently on the same wavelength. We gave the website one last check before publishing and discovered Google Toolbar is dead. Google shut down the website sometime in the past week, just before its birthday. RIP.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813243#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813243&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5586817dc4e2cd8740dea239ae8b313e8f08dadcb00bacafa3832eb9a1e59382","category":"Tech"}
