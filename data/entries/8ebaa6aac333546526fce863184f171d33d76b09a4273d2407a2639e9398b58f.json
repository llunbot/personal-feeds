We have a big roundup of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/11/best-early-black-friday-deals-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">best early Black Friday deals we can find</a> more generally, but today we wanted to break out a separate roundup for video game discounts, since a metric ton of them have gone live across several retailers this week.</p>\n<p>Major retailers like <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1305166/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2F&amp;subid1=ArsEarlyBF2021\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cf3SfRrXnrL\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals&amp;subid1=ArsEarlyBF2021\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> have already kicked off their official sales, as have the digital gaming <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/5znktfnh\" target=\"_blank\">storefronts for Xbox</a> and <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/black-friday/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation</a>, with others like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30OWyRV\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> price-matching many of the better offers. We've pored over as many so-called deals as we can find from all of them and have listed the genuine discounts we like below, spotlighting a few particularly notable offers along the way.</p>\n<p>Before you dig in, note that the sales haven't made in-demand hardware like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/sony-playstation-5-where-to-pre-order/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/xbox-series-x-s-where-to-preorder/\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series X</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/nintendo-switch-oled-where-to-preorder/\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-review-3090s-power-for-300-less-theoretically/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia's newer RTX GPUs</a> any easier to buy, though the lower-power Xbox Series S does <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cf3SpvTsQJD\" target=\"_blank\">look like it's available</a> in some capacity. We aren't seeing notable discounts on <em>brand</em>-<em>new</em> big-name games like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-and-shining-pearl-review-un-bucking-convention/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/mario-party-superstars-is-the-greatest-hits-album-the-series-deserves/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mario Party Superstars</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/forza-horizon-5-game-review-a-gorgeous-drive-to-familiar-heights/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a>, and <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, either, though several well-reviewed games released earlier this year are discounted.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814874#p3\">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814874&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeff Dunn","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ebaa6aac333546526fce863184f171d33d76b09a4273d2407a2639e9398b58f","category":"Tech"}
