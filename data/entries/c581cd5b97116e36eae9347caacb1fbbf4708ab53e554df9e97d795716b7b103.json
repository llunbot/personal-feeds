Every red-blooded cyclist loves the lively ride feel of a classic round-tube steel frame, but pop one in the wind-tunnel next to a modern carbon fibre aero machine and there’s going to be a clear winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But do steel and aero have to be mutually exclusive? Over in the United States, framebuilder Rob English has been incorporating aerodynamic elements into handmade bicycles for years, using clever welding techniques and custom-rolled aero tubes that allow the air to glide smoothly around his metal creations. Closer to home, the UK’s very own Owen Sherlock is doing something similar out of the Môn Cycles workshop in Anglesey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As it turns out, it’s actually quite a difficult thing to do, but we’re getting there,’ says Sherlock. ‘It can be a long and challenging process to do something non-standard. It would have been a lot easier to make a round-tube frame, but I wanted to do something different and a bit out of the ordinary.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-steel-bikes-any-good\">Opinion: Steel bikes are overrated</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/silva-cycles\">Meet the makers: Guy Munnings and Dai Williams of Silva Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sideways-viola-townsend\">Meet the maker: Viola Townsend of Sideways</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dan-craven-onguza-bicycles\">Meet the maker: Dan Craven of Onguza Bicycles</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Island boy</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Sherlock Mon Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sherlock fell in love with cycling in his teens before going on to work as a bike mechanic. It was as a mechanic that he originally started Môn, but when Covid started causing supply chain headaches he decided to turn his attention to building bikes instead of fixing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People always think it’s a French name,’ says Sherlock. ‘Môn is actually the Welsh word for the Island of Anglesey. That’s where I live. I’m a Londoner originally, but I’ve been here for the past six years. This place got me back into road riding after a long time off and I just love it. So I thought it was appropriate to name the bikes after the island.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Sherlock’s first bikes was a 1985 Colnago Super. He speaks fondly of it and still enjoys riding it several decades later: ‘It’s a fantastic bike. It has really aggressive geometry and is so exciting to ride. That’s what I wanted to build – something that was as exciting as my Colnago, but that wasn’t going to come with a huge aero penalty when I go out on a fast club ride.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Sherlock Mon Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That was the thought process that led Sherlock to build the bike you see here. It’s somewhat prosaically dubbed the ‘Aero Steel Bike’, but what it lacks in a zingy name it more than compensates for in aerodynamic perks and head-turning looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Building this frame was very, very labour-intensive,’ says Sherlock. ‘Pretty much every tube is the second or third attempt at trying to get it absolutely spot on. Believe it or not, it was probably about 300 hours for the whole process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s mostly Columbus tubing, apart from the seat tube, which is a custom-made 4130 profile tube. It’s only 13mm wide, so it’s a tiny little tube with tiny little 10mm seatstays. It was a bit of a mix and match to tell you the truth. I think my next iteration is going to be almost all Reynolds steel.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The subtly curved top tube is one of the quirks that Sherlock often finds himself explaining to people. He needed a tube with a large taper to join the 13mm seat tube to the 36mm head tube, but all he had to hand to hand was a chainstay, which unsurprisingly wasn’t long enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I ended up sleeving one chainstay over another to extend the length. Then I blended that in. It just so happened to have a slight S-bend in it. It’s something that’s gathered a lot of attention. More than I imagined it would.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The thing with building bikes is that if you just throw all the UCI rules out of the window you can do whatever you like. Dropping the seatstays right down helps with the aerodynamics, and the extra tube that runs between the seat tube and the down tube is to spread the load a little bit, because I wasn’t sure how strong the seat tube was going to be. It was all purely experimental.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Sherlock Mon Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/meet-the-maker-mon-cycles-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Other quirky details include the eccentric mechanism at the saddle clamp, which allows for 12mm of height and fore/aft adjustment. It makes for an aerodynamic and uncluttered seat tube by removing the need for a seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bending the rules</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are the TriRig callipers, which bolster aerodynamics further still. The rear one is mounted underneath the chainstay bridge, and according to Sherlock, not only are they more aero than disc brakes, they’re more aero than not having any brakes at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People have compared them to Campagnolo Delta brakes from the 1980s,’ says Sherlock. ‘They were beautiful things but didn’t work very well. These actually do work very well.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sherlock plans to keep improving the Aero Steel Bike, and has even been chatting to a Formula 1 aerodynamicist who is helping him refine the design. The idea is that Môn’s aero bikes will eventually be available to purchase, but Sherlock is still unsure on pricing. ‘It all depends on how much I can get the production time down. I couldn’t put a figure on it right now but they’re not going to be cheap, let’s put it that way.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 140 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mon-cycles\">Meet the maker: Owen Sherlock of Môn Cycles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c581cd5b97116e36eae9347caacb1fbbf4708ab53e554df9e97d795716b7b103","category":"Cycling"}
