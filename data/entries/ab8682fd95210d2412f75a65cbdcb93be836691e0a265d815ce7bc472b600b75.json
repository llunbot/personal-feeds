A few days ago I started to fight against a strong enemy, a lymphoma, which will require all my efforts and the warmth of my family, lifelong friends and Trek-Segafredo teammates.<br /><br />It will take time, but I’m relieved that the Team is in very good hands thanks to an experienced group of people that will lead until I am back.<br /><br />See you soon,<br />Luca</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The 48-year-old Italian has been with Trek-Segafredo since 2011 and was instrumental in setting up the women’s squad in time for the 2019 season. Before joining the US-registered outfit, Guercilena spent several years working as a sports director after starting out in sports science and performance coaching. Over the years, he’s built up a reputation founded on respect, passion and loyalty, and is popular throughout the world of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CyclingTips sends Luca our best and we hope to see him back with Trek-Segafredo soon.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/trek-segafredo-manager-luca-guercilena-takes-a-break-to-fight-cancer/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ab8682fd95210d2412f75a65cbdcb93be836691e0a265d815ce7bc472b600b75","category":"Cycling"}
