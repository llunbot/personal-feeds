The tool measures the total time between a mouse click and the flash of an on-screen muzzle that indicates a shot being fired—the lower, the better for the game's responsiveness.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the best improvements in input lag were measured when the Steam Deck OLED was running at a full 90 fps. Compared to the 60 fps LCD Steam Deck, input lag was reduced by an average of 26.1 ms for <em>Doom Eternal</em> and 32.5 ms for <em>Crysis 3</em>. While some of that reduction can be attributed to the shorter time between frame refreshes on the OLED (11.11 ms on the OLED at 90 fps versus 16.66 ms on the LCD at 60 fps), the size of the reduction here amounts to multiple 90 fps frames.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985481#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985481&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a145f18cb1f3fae42240ce01f8c9314d3b52ea5bf4835a57ee35c7633f9d553","category":"Tech"}
