The delisting comes earlier than expected for the title and coincides with the company's launch of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/ea-friendship-ended-with-fifa-now-ea-sports-fc-is-my-best-friend/\">the newly FIFA-license-free <em>EA Sports FC 24</em></a>.</p>\n<p>While many reports suggest there has been a recent mass purge of all legacy <em>FIFA</em> games from online stores, EA has a history of delisting older sports titles at a pretty regular cadence. <em>FIFA 22</em>, for instance, was <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/changelist/18816609/\">delisted</a> from <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230602183644/https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fifa-22-nintendo-switch-legacy-edition-switch/\">digital storefronts</a> in May of this year, roughly seven months after the launch of the subsequent <em>FIFA 23</em>. And <em>FIFA 21</em> wasn't taken down from Steam <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/1313860/history/?changeid=15214908\">until June of 2022</a>, about eight months after <em>FIFA 22</em>'s launch.</p>\n<p><em>FIFA 23</em>, on the other hand, has been delisted less than a year from its October 2022 launch. <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/1811260/history/\">SteamDB tracking data</a> suggests that the delisting came on September 21, the day before the new <em>EA Sports FC</em> became available for a 10-hour early access trial for EA Play members. The <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811260/EA_SPORTS_FIFA_23/?curator_clanid=4777282\">Steam store page for <em>FIFA 23</em></a> now notes that the delisting comes \"at the request of the publisher\" and that the game \"will not appear in search.\" The game also no longer appears <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Electronic%20Arts\">on Steam's EA publisher page</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971442#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971442&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d16ee54efb2d897b823aa5b72c3c845843c5608862691cbacd954e7c107c6229","category":"Tech"}
