The woman is thought to be the first reported human to ever have an infection with this snake-adapted worm, and it is the first time the worm has been found burrowing through a mammalian brain.</p>\n<p>When the woman's illness began, \"trying to identify the microscopic larvae, which had never previously been identified as causing human infection, was a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack,\" Karina Kennedy, a professor at the Australian National University (ANU) Medical School and Director of Clinical Microbiology at Canberra Hospital, said in a press release.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963908#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963908&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"07a0172b642e5d5180eade06a1ce0400ed17b7893f7193c945bc47012847c616","category":"Tech"}
